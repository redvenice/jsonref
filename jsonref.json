In contrast to claims that there were not enough pizzas, this was not the case.One visitor said he waited 30 minutes for a single slice of pizza (Picture: Tim SwabeyTwitterPA Wire)‘Our team was hard at work to ensure that everyone was able to sample pizzas. However, it was unfortunate that the queues grew due to some overzealous appetites, preventing others to be able to enjoy the food.’Bellmonte Life said they had planned to offer an ‘authentic Italian experience’ at the festival with beer, Prosecco, cocktails, live music, and unlimited pizza, but were faced with problems on the opening night on Friday.Londoner Alex White, 28, said she abandoned the festival to go to a pizza restaurant having only eaten two slices in one-and-a-half hours.‘I’m definitely annoyed, it was clearly very badly thought through,’ said Alex, who bought two tickets from the Groupon discount site for £15.She continued: ‘There weren’t any event organisers we could identify at the event itself, so we couldn’t really get any updates or redress on the day itself.‘No-one was giving us any information or updates about how it was going either, so that was pretty frustrating, although to be fair to them the pizza itself wasn’t bad, when we got it.’Tim Swabey, 24, said: ‘When we arrived at the festival we were immediately surprised by the long queues for pizza at each stall.‘The pizzas were being brought out really slowly on an ad hoc basis. It was clear that they had sold hundreds of tickets without thinking about how to cook the amount of pizza needed. I waited in a line for around 30 minutes for a single piece of pizza.’The political consultant, from West Hampstead, added: ‘It looked like something that had already passed through a cat’s digestive system. It was a real disappointment.‘The organisers were slow to realise there was a problem, but eventually gave out free wine for people to drink while they waited. It’s a real shame, as it could have been a great event with more planning.’Responding to the complaints in a statement on Monday, Bellmonte Life said £2,000 worth of complimentary glasses of champagne, wine and Prosecco was poured for festival-goers when it became clear that pizzas were not reaching everyone.The company wrote: ‘On behalf of the Bellmonte Life management, we want to sincerely apologise for the unfortunate events that took place during Notting Hill Pizza Festival on Friday May 11.‘After our team worked all Friday night to find emergency ovens, our Pizza Festival was fully operational for the remaining two sessions and over 1,800 pizzas were served on Saturday.Bellmonte issued an open letter on Twitter (Picture: TwitterBellmonte Life)‘Bellmonte Life takes pride in providing unique experience events.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1.

Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation.

Meghan and Harry’s wedding feast will NOT be a seated affair as it’s revealed trendy ‘bowl food’ will be served as guests mingle Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not have a sitdown wedding breakfast after their ceremony on Saturday – but have plumped for trendy ‘bowl food’ instead.Their 600 guests will be standing up in St George’s Hall at Windsor Castle when they are served seasonal ‘mini main courses’, made by the Queen’s kitchen staff and presented to them by liveried waiters and waitresses.Bowl food has become a popular choice for business events because it is more sociable, allowing guests to mingle and network while eating.However, it is a somewhat more surprising choice for a royal wedding.            Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not have a sitdown wedding breakfast after their ceremony on Saturday – but have plumped for trendy ‘bowl food’ instead            The Royal Kitchen at Windsor Castle has begun preparations for the wedding banquet    Pictured the Royal Palaces Head chef Mark Flanagan (right) and the Royal Palaces Pastry chef Selwyn Stoby (left)Still, Harry and Meghan hope that it will make the occasion less fussy and allow them to move around the room greeting as many guests as possible.Guests will also feast on canapes during the lunchtime reception, which will last around two and a half hours and includes speeches and cutting of the cake. Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.Baby dies after falling from mother\u0027s arms on escalatorFootage of people running away from knifeman in ParisBaroness Chakrabarti: Ken Livingstone should be expelled from LabourCheeky pooches team together to eat some treatsTeenager found with knife stuck in her cheek after being muggedSpecialist police and dogs train in Windsor prior to royal weddingFisherman airlifted to hospital after shark attack in CornwallMeghan Markle\u0027s half-sister says: Staged photos were my faultTown of Windsor gets ready for the upcoming Royal Wedding"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/10/4C2A21B100000578-0-image-m-16_1526202287952.jpg","title":"High rise building topples wrong way buries digger controlled demolition China","story":"    A few members of public stood close at a site to see a building being demolished in ChinaThe incident took place in Nanning of Guangxi Autonomous Region on May 11, according to Star Channel.As onlookers gathered behind a warning tape near the building to witness the demolition, the plan went wrong as the building collapsed towards the pedestrians.Rare footage captures wild panda mothers and their cubs...Chinese double amputee, 69, who lost legs while climbing...Driver patiently waits to be rescued after a passing lorry...Heroic pilot safely lands plane full of passengers after...Share this articleMobile phone footage captured a few onlookers running as the high-rise building tumbled and buried in a mist of dust and sand.There were no details of the construction company disclosed yet as police started investigating into details. No workers or onlookers were injured in the incident.   The building fell at a wrong direction unexpectedly and collapsed onto a pedestrian street (left).

I was so shocked at what was happening. I just said \u0027it\u0027s dead, this baby is going to die\u0027. I was so shocked.\u0027\u0027          Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labourThe hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 as the unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated.It can be 10cm fully dilated.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: \u0027I remember 3cm dilation being said and I saw Dr Laxman go to examine her but I don\u0027t know what she was doing. \u0027I believe she was examining the patient to confirm the findings but she didn\u0027t tell me why she was examining the patient. \u0027She could not comment on what she was doing but another doctor told me they were not considering a Caesarean section. All I heard Dr Laxman say to the patient was \u0027I\u0027m going to examine you\u0027.\u0027If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery. I never got the information that she was going to do that. I\u0027m not sure what she was doing.Premature baby was DECAPITATED inside his mother\u0027s womb...Share this article\u0027We were set up for a c-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated. I was under the impression we were going to do a c-section and this caused us a delay - I didn\u0027t know what she was planning.\u0027I said \u0027are you not going for a section\u0027 and all she said was \u0027I know that\u0027. I don\u0027t know what the plan was in her mind. After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn\u0027t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.\u0027The patient was pushing the baby and the baby was being delivered by traction. It was repeated pulls and traction and it lasted for approximately 15-20 minutes.\u0027I wanted to look for any foetal abnormality but Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down. This was not what I was expecting.           Dr Vaishnavy Laxman outside her MPTS tribunal hearing at the GMC in Manchester\u0027If she was only at 3cm it would have been right for her to have a c-section. I just said \u0027this baby is dead now\u0027 I was so shocked. I didn\u0027t express this to Dr Laxman.\u0027I had no confirmation of this as I wasn\u0027t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped. I saw the baby\u0027s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.\u0027Dr Laxman said to the patient \u0027give me a good push\u0027 and there was repeated pulling on the legs and body. Sometimes the shoulders are tricky to deliver as the arms can get stuck and it can be heard to get out.\u0027The information of her consultation was that she was not properly dilated but it was hard to know how hard this was to get the baby out. There was two attempts made by Dr Laxman to cut the cervix but I didn\u0027t know what she was doing.\u0027Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a \u0027fragile\u0027 baby like the infant who died would suffer \u0027a lot more damage if pulled or twisted\u0027.The hearing continues.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Who Tiger Woodss girlfriend Erica Herman revealed","story":"Jon Stewart and Dave Chappelle announce joint stand-up tourWho is Kelvin Hayden?

We mustn’t upset Brussels, after all.Many listeners would have concluded that a man who gives up his seat in Parliament and takes a huge salary abroad has no right to pontificate on our political future. Will voters really welcome him back to the country he abandoned?They will point to the irony in Miliband, 52, taking time off from his £400,000-a-year job running the International Rescue charity in New York to portray himself as the lost voice of the British people.His former constituency, South Shields, is in the South Tyneside area, which voted 68 per cent Leave in the referendum — not that listening to the people comes naturally to a man more used to hobnobbing with liberal darlings such as George Clooney and Hillary Clinton.  Tony Blair is behind the BRexit bashing comeback of former British foreign secretary David Miliband, Andrew Pierce writesHow piquant that Miliband Major has resurfaced just as his former role as foreign secretary is under the microscope. It was only last Thursday that Theresa May apologised over the Blair government’s involvement in the torture of a Libyan dissident by the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli.Miliband, who became foreign secretary three years later in 2007, has been accused of lying over what he knew about extraordinary rendition (the euphemism for the kidnap and torture of terror suspects overseen by the CIA) in an attempt to keep the New Labour government off the hook. Funny how he didn’t mention that at yesterday’s carefully stage-managed launch.Undoubtedly, his appearance with Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan will fuel speculation that he is planning to revive his political career.Diane Abbott is caught out posting a FAKE image of an...Beam them up! Star Trek captain joins MPs on Planet Bremoan...Share this articleOne reason why he left Britain was the falling-out with his brother. Relations became so poor that he failed to invite Ed to his 50th birthday party in London in 2015.But, intriguingly, David has now buried the hatchet with Ed. A friend of the family told me this week: ‘They will never be as close as they were, but they are talking again. They have young children and want the children to get together.’AttentionWhile Miliband has made a success of his new life in the U.S., he was bitterly disappointed that his friend Hillary Clinton failed to become the Democratic president. There was even talk of a big job under Clinton in the American government, but the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has forced Miliband to turn his attention to British politics once more.A return to these shores would offer tempting career prospects for Miliband’s wife, Louise Shackelton, a concert violinist. Last autumn, the celebrated conductor Sir Simon Rattle returned to Britain after more than a decade at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic. He is now director of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). Despite living in New York, Ms Shackelton has played with the LSO in London since Rattle’s return, and there would be a permanent post if she wanted it. A complicating factor if the Milibands returned to Britain is that their young sons are happily settled in schools in New York.However, there is a ‘break clause’ this year in Miliband’s contract with International Rescue. That means the reaction to yesterday’s performance — among the public and from MPs — may have a major bearing on whether he has a future in British politics.While he is seen by Blairite MPs as his party’s lost leader, Miliband knows the chances of making a successful second bid for the leadership are challenging, to say the least.          Former foreign secretary David Miliband, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg and Conservative ex-cabinet minister Nicky Morgan are launching anti-Brexit driveSaviourThe majority of Labour’s 500,000 members, who have the final say over the leadership, are followers of Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left politics, which means it might even be difficult for David Miliband to be selected for a safe Labour seat. The Corbynista roots already run deep, and they loathe Blairites almost as much as they hate Tories.But what if Miliband is not interested in leading Labour: what if he has ambitions to set up a new centrist party instead? It might appeal to his Remoaner chum Clegg, who is increasingly out of step with the Lib Dems since the collapse of the coalition, and to Tory malcontents such as Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, who were both sacked by Mrs May.The creation of a new party is, in fact, the brainchild of a businessman named Simon Franks, who is reportedly putting up £50 million to make it a reality, having made his fortune renting out DVDs. He has called it ‘Project One Movement for the UK’.Does Miliband see himself as the saviour of British politics, riding in on his white charger to plant his flag in the centre ground? Watch this space.Whether British voters will welcome the return of the ‘king across the water’ is rather less certain.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/00/4C35D42F00000578-0-image-a-8_1526342033093.jpg","title":"Pensioner 75 hails hero border collie ran help got lost walk","story":"    A pensioner trapped in the woods has hailed her own \u0027Lassie\u0027 dog a hero for an incredible rescue that saved her life          Border collie Bonnie sprung into action after her owner Val Smith, 75, got tangled up in brambles after getting lost during a walk in Widey Woods in Plymouth, DevonAt first, Val feared she\u0027d lost Bonnie forever when she raced off.Yet Bonnie encountered two local teachers from a local primary school who happened to be out walking - they apparently sensed something was wrong as soon as they saw the distressed dog.Meghan Markle\u0027s father will NOT attend the Royal Wedding...Pictured: Horrific wounds suffered by fisherman, 21, who was...Share this articleThey followed the Bonnie for around 500 yards, down several winding paths, before finding Val - who was astonished her beloved pet had returned - and with help in tow.Val said she had been out for the day walking when she took a few wrong turns, ended up on a different path and got overwhelmed by thick, gnarly shrubs.

The horse rescuer has revealed there has been a huge number of horses being mistreated There’s Daisy, found as a stray in the streets of Chessington Thelma and Louise, left loose in the back roads of Dunsfold Teddy, a young stallion dumped on private property, and Ziggy, another young stallion, abandoned with a filly to wander the lanes.Yesterday’s Mail carried the shocking picture of a pony dumped in the small garden of a home in Stoke-on-Trent.The owner had placed an online advert saying the pony would be put down if nobody could take it, and a 13-year-old girl replied with her grandmother’s address. A man then arrived, dumped the pony and disappeared. In the past few years, horses have been abandoned in their thousands — and it’s getting worse.The RSPCA said last month the number of horses it had rescued has hit a four-year high, with 980 horses being taken into care last year and an average of 80 phone calls a day coming in about horses. Many are in terrible health.Some come from breeders with too many foals who don’t care what happens to them, so long as it costs their business nothing.          Landowners are simply unable to keep their horses due to financial woes and others \u0027simply don\u0027t care\u0027 Jenny Seagrove saysSince the horse meat food scandal in 2013, when sickened shoppers learned that horseflesh was being used in many supermarket ‘beef’ products, the secretive market for human consumption has been shut off to these unscrupulous breeders.But with economic troubles, and the cost of land rising, many private owners are just unable to keep their horses.Some come to us in desperation. They have lost their jobs, fallen ill or been through a orce, and simply can’t afford to stable their beloved animal. Others are getting old and can no longer cope. In some cases, one horse has died and left a second miserable and lonely — a busy sanctuary is a happier place to spend twilight years than an empty field.I have deep sympathy with these owners. If they come to us, they are doing the best they can for their horses.But many others simply don’t care. They condemn their animals to live and die in conditions that beggar belief. Take Millie and Horus — a young mare, and a handsome stallion in his early 20s.They were left in a field of about 100 horses with no food or water. When rescuers found them, the field was scattered with dead and dying animals — Millie and Horus were among the survivors.Woman whose two thoroughbreds were so malnourished they had...A night-mare! Woody looks like the whitest horse in the...Share this articleTwo of our gentlest creatures are mother and daughter, Gwen and Phyllis. Gwen had been savagely beaten and tethered to a goalpost to give birth, and was cut loose, terrified and traumatised.It never fails to baffle me that people treat horses so brutally.One of our herd leaders was called Ernie, a gentle giant 18 hands high, a favourite with mares and visitors. Everyone loved Ernie. But it wasn’t always the case. When he came to us, he would bite the hands and faces of anyone who got too close. He’d been beaten so badly he defended himself against all humans. Gradually, we taught him he didn’t have to be afraid.This is the most rewarding work in the world. Mind you, I never set out to run a sanctuary. I’m an actress and I love my work.But, in 2011, someone I knew phoned me with a desperate problem: she was running a private animal rescue centre and had somehow acquired 40 horses and many other animals and birds.It was hardly surprising that she’d run out of money and I just couldn’t turn my back. I realised there was something I could do: I could start a charity that would take responsibility for the animals and their welfare. Little did I know what a huge task that would be.So with friends and the public being amazingly supportive, Mane Chance was born.It wasn’t all plain sailing. At 7am on the first Sunday after our horses moved into their new home, I had an anguished call from a neighbour. Quad bikers had charged through our field, knocked down the electric fences and spooked the horses . . . who were galloping round the 18th green of the local golf club, causing mayhem.          Jenny Seagrove: \u0027I wish I could say it was rare at Mane Chance Sanctuary to take animals that have been so horribly mistreated, but sadly it is all too common\u0027After six months, the ‘non-equine’ residents and some horses were rehomed, as we worked out a manageable number we could care for. Since 2011, that number has risen to 33 — any more and our staff, and tireless volunteers, risk being stretched too thin. Even within those limits, annual running costs are around £300,000. We’re supported by selfless donors, sponsors, grant givers and businesses, but because of the work we do with young people we need staff experienced at working with people as well as horses. And we need good facilities. It all costs money.Our work with young people began with two Shetland ponies called Grimbo and Mr Smith, who loved company.We took them to a local hospice, and I was amazed to see the powerful effect on children who sat or stood with them, stroking them, giving and receiving unconditional love. It was so moving to watch . . . and it gave me an idea.Most of our horses will never be ridden. Some are too old, others have arthritis. But they can help people, just by being horses. Not all our rescue animals are suitable for this work, but many love it.They seem to understand, when a child with a terminal illness, perhaps, or an older person with dementia, is quietly sharing their company, that they are doing important work.We don’t make any horse work if it doesn’t clearly want to. Most are only too happy to be fussed over, though. In fact, they are so content we’ve decided many will never be rehomed — they’ve endured desperate hardship, and now they’ve found a place they love. We owe them the chance to stay.But with Mane Chance at full capacity, and more calls each week, we need to do more. Tighter legislation is part of it: breeders must not continue to dump young stallions just because they have little use for them (unlike mares, which can bear foals).New laws on microchipping, which will lead to a national ownership register called the Central Equine Database, should help. So would better education for the public: people need to understand how costly it is to keep a horse.Humane euthanasia, when a sick animal needs to be put down, costs about £500, for example. It’s never an acceptable option to dump the poor creature in a field instead.Mane Chance is trying to show that horses don’t need to be thrown away. We dream of little rescued herds all over the country, helping people. We save them, but in many ways they save us, too.n The fee for this article has been donated to Mane Chance Sanctuary (manechance sanctuary.org). "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/07/4C17204A00000578-5725545-image-a-5_1526277656899.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle spend unmarried weekend Cotswolds","story":"Embrace embellishment like Meghan in Ralph \u0026amp RussoThe royal engagement photographs released late in 2017 caused quite the stir with Meghan Markle in a show-stopping dress by Ralph \u0026amp Russo.From the autumn\u0026#x2Fwinter \u0026#3916 couture collection, this gorgeous gown features a tulle skirt complete with a sheer bodice decorated with intricate leaf embellishment.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not have a sitdown wedding breakfast after their ceremony on Saturday – but have plumped for trendy ‘bowl food’ instead            The Royal Kitchen at Windsor Castle has begun preparations for the wedding banquet    Pictured the Royal Palaces Head chef Mark Flanagan (right) and the Royal Palaces Pastry chef Selwyn Stoby (left)Still, Harry and Meghan hope that it will make the occasion less fussy and allow them to move around the room greeting as many guests as possible.Guests will also feast on canapes during the lunchtime reception, which will last around two and a half hours and includes speeches and cutting of the cake. Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.Baby dies after falling from mother\u0027s arms on escalatorFootage of people running away from knifeman in ParisBaroness Chakrabarti: Ken Livingstone should be expelled from LabourCheeky pooches team together to eat some treatsTeenager found with knife stuck in her cheek after being muggedSpecialist police and dogs train in Windsor prior to royal weddingFisherman airlifted to hospital after shark attack in CornwallMeghan Markle\u0027s half-sister says: Staged photos were my faultTown of Windsor gets ready for the upcoming Royal Wedding"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/15/4C38EA6400000578-5726901-image-a-61_1526306615176.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan stay separate Windsor hotels night wedding","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on May 19 in Windsor but will stay apart on the night before  Prince Harry will stay at the Dorchester Collection\u0027s Coworth Park (pictured) in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on Friday, which is owned by the Sultan of Brunei  Harry and his brother will enjoy sumptuously furnished bedrooms like this on the night before walking down the aisle  Meghan will stay at Cliveden House Hotel (pictured), on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate, with her mother Doria.

I was so shocked at what was happening. I just said \u0027it\u0027s dead, this baby is going to die\u0027. I was so shocked.\u0027\u0027          Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labourThe hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 as the unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated.It can be 10cm fully dilated.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: \u0027I remember 3cm dilation being said and I saw Dr Laxman go to examine her but I don\u0027t know what she was doing. \u0027I believe she was examining the patient to confirm the findings but she didn\u0027t tell me why she was examining the patient. \u0027She could not comment on what she was doing but another doctor told me they were not considering a Caesarean section. All I heard Dr Laxman say to the patient was \u0027I\u0027m going to examine you\u0027.\u0027If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery. I never got the information that she was going to do that. I\u0027m not sure what she was doing.Premature baby was DECAPITATED inside his mother\u0027s womb...Share this article\u0027We were set up for a c-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated. I was under the impression we were going to do a c-section and this caused us a delay - I didn\u0027t know what she was planning.\u0027I said \u0027are you not going for a section\u0027 and all she said was \u0027I know that\u0027. I don\u0027t know what the plan was in her mind. After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn\u0027t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.\u0027The patient was pushing the baby and the baby was being delivered by traction. It was repeated pulls and traction and it lasted for approximately 15-20 minutes.\u0027I wanted to look for any foetal abnormality but Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down. This was not what I was expecting.           Dr Vaishnavy Laxman outside her MPTS tribunal hearing at the GMC in Manchester\u0027If she was only at 3cm it would have been right for her to have a c-section. I just said \u0027this baby is dead now\u0027 I was so shocked. I didn\u0027t express this to Dr Laxman.\u0027I had no confirmation of this as I wasn\u0027t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped. I saw the baby\u0027s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.\u0027Dr Laxman said to the patient \u0027give me a good push\u0027 and there was repeated pulling on the legs and body. Sometimes the shoulders are tricky to deliver as the arms can get stuck and it can be heard to get out.\u0027The information of her consultation was that she was not properly dilated but it was hard to know how hard this was to get the baby out. There was two attempts made by Dr Laxman to cut the cervix but I didn\u0027t know what she was doing.\u0027Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a \u0027fragile\u0027 baby like the infant who died would suffer \u0027a lot more damage if pulled or twisted\u0027.The hearing continues.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/21/4C3C9B5800000578-5728377-image-a-43_1526329253017.jpg","title":"Marriage proposal upstaged 3 year olds call nature","story":"A hilarious video shows the moment Kevin Przytula, 33, drops down on one knee to propose to  longtime girlfriend Allyssa Anter, 27, at the same time that Anter\u0027s three-year-old son Owen drops his pants to answer nature\u0027s call on Saturday in Bay City, Michigan          Anter gleefully saying \u0027yes\u0027 to the proposal as the two embrace, blissfully unaware that right behind them Owen was emptying his bladder on the sidewalkPartners in crime!

Which presumably he would regard as a happy outcome. We mustn’t upset Brussels, after all.Many listeners would have concluded that a man who gives up his seat in Parliament and takes a huge salary abroad has no right to pontificate on our political future. Will voters really welcome him back to the country he abandoned?They will point to the irony in Miliband, 52, taking time off from his £400,000-a-year job running the International Rescue charity in New York to portray himself as the lost voice of the British people.His former constituency, South Shields, is in the South Tyneside area, which voted 68 per cent Leave in the referendum — not that listening to the people comes naturally to a man more used to hobnobbing with liberal darlings such as George Clooney and Hillary Clinton.  Tony Blair is behind the BRexit bashing comeback of former British foreign secretary David Miliband, Andrew Pierce writesHow piquant that Miliband Major has resurfaced just as his former role as foreign secretary is under the microscope. It was only last Thursday that Theresa May apologised over the Blair government’s involvement in the torture of a Libyan dissident by the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli.Miliband, who became foreign secretary three years later in 2007, has been accused of lying over what he knew about extraordinary rendition (the euphemism for the kidnap and torture of terror suspects overseen by the CIA) in an attempt to keep the New Labour government off the hook. Funny how he didn’t mention that at yesterday’s carefully stage-managed launch.Undoubtedly, his appearance with Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan will fuel speculation that he is planning to revive his political career.Diane Abbott is caught out posting a FAKE image of an...Beam them up! Star Trek captain joins MPs on Planet Bremoan...Share this articleOne reason why he left Britain was the falling-out with his brother. Relations became so poor that he failed to invite Ed to his 50th birthday party in London in 2015.But, intriguingly, David has now buried the hatchet with Ed. A friend of the family told me this week: ‘They will never be as close as they were, but they are talking again. They have young children and want the children to get together.’AttentionWhile Miliband has made a success of his new life in the U.S., he was bitterly disappointed that his friend Hillary Clinton failed to become the Democratic president. There was even talk of a big job under Clinton in the American government, but the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has forced Miliband to turn his attention to British politics once more.A return to these shores would offer tempting career prospects for Miliband’s wife, Louise Shackelton, a concert violinist. Last autumn, the celebrated conductor Sir Simon Rattle returned to Britain after more than a decade at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic. He is now director of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). Despite living in New York, Ms Shackelton has played with the LSO in London since Rattle’s return, and there would be a permanent post if she wanted it. A complicating factor if the Milibands returned to Britain is that their young sons are happily settled in schools in New York.However, there is a ‘break clause’ this year in Miliband’s contract with International Rescue. That means the reaction to yesterday’s performance — among the public and from MPs — may have a major bearing on whether he has a future in British politics.While he is seen by Blairite MPs as his party’s lost leader, Miliband knows the chances of making a successful second bid for the leadership are challenging, to say the least.          Former foreign secretary David Miliband, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg and Conservative ex-cabinet minister Nicky Morgan are launching anti-Brexit driveSaviourThe majority of Labour’s 500,000 members, who have the final say over the leadership, are followers of Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left politics, which means it might even be difficult for David Miliband to be selected for a safe Labour seat. The Corbynista roots already run deep, and they loathe Blairites almost as much as they hate Tories.But what if Miliband is not interested in leading Labour: what if he has ambitions to set up a new centrist party instead? It might appeal to his Remoaner chum Clegg, who is increasingly out of step with the Lib Dems since the collapse of the coalition, and to Tory malcontents such as Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, who were both sacked by Mrs May.The creation of a new party is, in fact, the brainchild of a businessman named Simon Franks, who is reportedly putting up £50 million to make it a reality, having made his fortune renting out DVDs. He has called it ‘Project One Movement for the UK’.Does Miliband see himself as the saviour of British politics, riding in on his white charger to plant his flag in the centre ground? Watch this space.Whether British voters will welcome the return of the ‘king across the water’ is rather less certain.     "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0c7076a06ed13ca2653d01020261aa70625b32/383_0_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61eac25fc3e507a66a7f8fbe881a45ea","title":"tacita dean landscape review a total eclipse of the senses","story":"From the steaming volcanoes of Yellowstone park to the mists of Bodmin Moor, the artist’s latest riveting work is like hitching a ride with Oedipus, Antigone and ZZ TopClouds and stones and clods of light. Mountains in Austria and an ant on a rock in Mexico. Best of all, a long, slow eclipse. The final exhibition in Tacita Dean’s three-part meditation on the portrait (at the National Portrait Gallery), the still life (at the National Gallery) and now Landscape (in three rooms of the new galleries at the Royal Academy), provides a summation of interrelated themes.These are less exhibitions about genre – portraiture, still life and landscape – than they are about Dean’s ongoing relationships with people, places and things. In others words, being in the world and making sense of it, or at least telling stories and making images. As well as dwelling on presence – the atmosphere of a confrontation with another human how light hits an object and somehow makes it magical the vagaries of weather, and place, and time – Dean’s art is also much concerned with the discoveries work itself makes. Four-, five-, six-, seven- and nine-leafed clovers laid out under glass, a field of good luck whose colours are fading from exposure to light. Here are the round stones she collects as happenstance dictates, and drawings of clouds and mountains, dragged, blurred and blown on to blackboards and slates shapes and thoughts and phrases written as into the air. None of the three shows amount to a retrospective, although Dean’s filmed portraits at the National Portrait Gallery began with her first filmed portrait, of Italian arte povera sculptor Mario Merz in 2002, and her Still Life exhibition included a film from 2008. She has also been collecting round stones and clover leaves for years. Over time, everything adds up, refers back and takes a step into the future. Dean’s latest film, Antigone, has been on her mind for more than 20 years, and she wrote about it in the  in 1997, as part of the diary she kept of her residency at the Sundance Screenwriters Lab in Utah. Part of her conversation there – with Stewart Stern, screenwriter of Rebel Without a Cause, starring James Dean – has become part of the script here. As does Canadian poet (and classics scholar) Anne Carson’s 2001 poem TV Men: Antigone (Scripts 1 and 2). Carson’s poem is a retelling of Antigone as if gone over by TV executives. What is really at the heart of the film is Dean’s relationship with her elder sister, named Antigone, who appears for a few frames in this looped, double-screen 35mm film. It is impossible to do justice to this almost hour-long film, with its multiple layerings, masked exposures and multiple viewpoints, its innovative technical manipulations of analogue film and its camerawork. The film is edited in the camera itself, as was her 2011 work Film at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall and the recent, tiny triple portrait His Portrait in Little, at the National Portrait Gallery. We go from closeups of smoking and steaming volcanic vents in Yellowstone National Park to the mists of Bodmin Moor. We visit the floodplains of the Mississippi in Wyoming, the town of Thebes, Illinois, and the courthouse where Abraham Lincoln first practiced. Here we meet Anne Carson and actor Stephen Dillane. For much of the film, Dillane is an Oedipus blinded by tinted glasses made for viewing the eclipse, and wearing a huge, straggly beard. He maunders across the world as though without purpose, at one point followed by a pair of curious dogs. As he walks out of frame, the dogs start copulating. Think ZZ Top. Think Saint Jerome. Think Harry Dean Stanton in the film Paris, Texas. A man on a mission, escaping his fate. Eagles circle the sky, their call a distant mewing. There are vultures and a crow stalks the horizon. Every moment of Antigone is a confusion, a complexity and a delight – a rich muddled stew of words and images, places and atmospheres. And through the imaginary day on which everything takes place, the sun is slowly eclipsed. At full eclipse, a black sun with a flaring corona looks back, like an eye. Colour is drained from the world and then all light. Film picks out the gradations of dying light, the last and first glimmers, and the florid corona of the eclipsed sun, to a degree and with a nuance that digital recording cannot approach. Through the film there are speeches and observations, bits of Sophocles, a parable told to Dean by Stern and snatches of Carson’s poem. It is often hard to tell where we are. Frequently, we are in several places at once. Dillane passes across the world like a cloud, his beard awry. Carson does a little dance on the courtroom steps, the zips and buckles of her leather jacket jangling with light.I can’t tell you what all this means. It is a whole world come together, splitting and parting and rejoining. Antigone is a film of origins and arrivals, incidence and coincidence and alignments, less a landscape than a world entire.• Tacita Dean: Landscape is at the Royal Academy, London, from 19 May until 12 August.

For Washington DC librarian Anna Holmes, it wasn’t so much the book, as the slice of Kraft American that she found inside it, clearly used by a cheese-loving patron as a bookmark. The library branch has seen three “cheese bookmark” incidents to date, according to Holmes, who made a plea on Twitter for readers to “PLEASE stop using cheese as a bookmark. Please. We give away actual bookmarks for free. Or like use a receipt or something. Just not perishables.”Whiffy as that sounds, that trio of dairy product delinquents are not the worst offenders, librarians across the world have revealed in response to Holmes’s plea. There are those who use banana skins, broccoli (“It was cooked and buttered well. I think the greasy stain made it easy for them to find their page”), cooked bacon and a fried chicken leg. Inedible but equally jarring fold-ins reported included Lego, flowers, money, a used condom, and a sawblade.Bacon, it turns out, appears to be a bit of a thing, with librarians previously reporting the discovery of surprise rashers all over the place. In his Salt Lake City branch, Josh Hanagarne also discovered “a lock of hair, like, the size a serial killer would take from a victim”, and “a Polaroid of a cat wearing a leather mask”.Conducting this important research also brought me to Forgotten Bookmarks, a gift of a website where used bookseller Michael Popek charts the things he finds inside the antiquarian books he buys. Some of the best include a marriage certificate dated 18 October 1899, found in an 1850 copy of the Bible, and a recipe for cheese souffle, found in Charles Darwin: Evolution and Natural Selection. But Popek’s site itself is a charming and moving glimpse into other people’s reading lives – the advertisement for a roach exterminator found in Backgrounds of American Literary Thought the family photographs left behind by previous readers the small and intriguing key found in Ocean Grove Christian Songs. Who were these readers, what did they think of these books, where are they now?As for me, I am an unabashed page turner-downer and spine-cracker of the books I own, to the horror of my husband. It’s sacrilege to many, but although I love my books, I don’t mind that they look read. And reread. And reread. They are not decoration.Library books, though – I wouldn’t dare. Receipts, hairbands, leaves – I’ve roped them all in. Never food, though. Never bacon. As Tom Clayton at Melville House ponders, how on earth does this scenario come about? “You’re halfway through breakfast … And you’re enjoying your library book, too. But! Then! The phone rings in the other room. You ignore it. It rings again. And again. It must be urgent. There’s only one logical thing to do in this situation: pop some bacon in your book.” Or maybe not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9603b429d3516f770f4ddfd33cb6055396ef307b/0_248_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bfc027befb53dff3dcebd44c0568107","title":"east coast rail franchise to be scrapped chris grayling","story":"Chris Grayling likely to introduce ‘not-for-profit’ arrangement on line from London to Edinburgh Chris Grayling is expected to make a decision “within days” to end the existing East Coast rail franchise operated by Stagecoach and Virgin Trains.The transport secretary was said to be preparing to either renationalise the London to Edinburgh line or negotiate a “not-for-profit” arrangement with Stagecoach and Virgin Trains before the end of the week. Grayling announced in November the franchise would be replaced in 2020, three years earlier than expected, allowing the companies to escape large payments. Two months later, he raised the prospect with MPs of the Department for Transport (DfT) running the line. However, he also held out the possibility that the operators could continue on fresh terms.But, according to the FT, he is now planning to scrap the franchise, the third time in less than a decade that the government has been forced to intervene.He is thought to be more likely to choose the temporary “not-for-profit” option in the short term, given his aversion to Labour’s re-nationalisation policy. Ministers have denied that the companies are being bailed out, saying they will lose a £165m performance bond and face other penalties. Beyond 2020, the government is expected to introduce a new public-private partnership model on the line. Virgin Trains East Coast said it had “met or exceeded” all of its contractual commitments on the East Coast line. The DfT declined to comment.Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: “This is the third time in 10 years that a private company has mucked up the east coast main line. In contrast, when it was run in the public sector, it returned £1bn to the Treasury.“That shows what we have been saying all along - that Britain’s railways should be run, successfully, as a public service, not for private profit. Because they can’t do it.

Many other qualities, too: her bravery her humour her work on Sure Start. But her kindness was stellar. What a power. I use that word knowingly, since kindness in public life is often confused with weakness, a more feminised way of doing politics. The opposite is true. Kindness is smart, strategic and absolutely lacking in public life at the moment.Samuel Johnson knew it: “Kindness is in our power, even when fondness is not,” he said. Some time ago, we were going to have a kinder, gentler politics ushered in by Jeremy Corbyn. Remember that fantasy? What we have now is such a polarisation of discourse that neither kindness nor rationality can get a look-in.If you did not vote remain, you are a brain-dead, selfish git. If you do not love Momentum, you are a Tory or, worse, a Blairite. If you want to ask a few questions about gender, you are a murdering terf (trans-exclusionary radical feminist).Now we have the term “gammon” to describe angry white men. Oscar Wilde must be turning in his grave.God knows if these hammy chaps are skilled or unskilled or live in the home counties or Sunderland. They are a bad joke. I am not a psephologist, but it would be a surprise to me if Labour never again needs their votes. Persuading former Tories to vote Labour is not, apparently, what it is all about.What would I know? I do not have a socialist heritage, but a working-class, Tory-voting one. Gammon blood? This is probably why I joined the Workers Revolutionary party at 14. My family are dead – I see now that they must have died from avocado deprivation – but they were always complicated, saying things of which I disapproved but then being totally accepting of differences of sexuality or race.My friendships have never been only with those who think like me. I find it possible to hate what the Tories do yet fail to think that every Tory voter is a monster any more than I think every former steel worker or miner is a paragon of radicalism. Indeed, much of the former industrial class is way nearer gammon than these new class warriors seem to understand. Sure, I am taking a bit of banter too seriously. Maybe. But this macho, confrontational, simplistic name-calling is as redundant as the kind of masculinity at which it pokes fun.Are gammon, melts and slugs up the class scale from chavs? I thought “chav” was a class slur. But then the parts of the left that believe themselves morally pure will not see their own racism, misogyny and class snobbery. Instead, they will lead the people they disdain to the promised land.Theirs is a worldview that says: do not show kindness to those who would not show kindness to you. The essential position of leave and remain is: do not seek to understand your enemy. Instead, yell insults. You are ham. You are angry. You are wrong. This is not conversation it is road rage dressed up as analysis. Once you look down on someone, it is impossible to help them up. It is a losing game.To engage takes kindness. Kindness is not a compromise or a cop-out. Above all, kindness demands courage. If kindness is not part of socialist vocabulary, count me out and call me any damn name you like. If I am lady gammon, cook me in Coca-Cola, as Nigella recommends. Delicious.The firm really are a mean old lot, aren’t they? Inviting commoners to gawk at Harry’s do, but deigning not to feed them. And declining to invite to the private reception a woman who adds to the gaiety of the nation: the Duchess of York. Good old, bad old Fergie. Is she any better than she ought to be? No. I have loved her since 1992, when she was pictured having her toes sucked by her financial adviser in St Tropez. Yolo, Fergs!A royal aide in 1994 called her “vulgar, vulgar, vulgar”. Unlike the others, some of whom need a valet to carry around their own toilet seat. I remember being at Diana’s funeral and Fergie being the only person who made any attempt to comfort those boys.Still, she went on Oprah in 2011 and apologised, talking sadly of how completely worthless she felt and the mistakes she had made. She was not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding, although Prince Andrew and their two daughters were.This is beyond rude. The fact that she and Andrew maintain properties – and a friendship – seems not to come into it. She is persona non grata. Yes, there is the matter of selling access to her former husband for £500,000 because she was broke. He denied any involvement. But what does he do when he is not on holiday, which normally he is? He had to step down from his role as a representative for international trade and investment because he liked to hang out with Jeffrey Epstein (jailed for sex offences), a Libyan gun smuggler and a billionaire in Kazakhstan. Is there a more vulgar lifestyle than doing deals with dictatorships?In the absence of Fergie, we can only hope that Princess Beatrice does not disappoint us and outdoes the Cthulhu headwear from the most recent royal wedding. Do it, Beatrice, for your poor, ostracised mother.Never mind that millennials – and I never truly have any idea of what they are – live in debt and can’t buy houses. Something even worse is happening to them. They cannot open Fray Bentos tins. They are not sure how and have to go on YouTube with hammers and screwdrivers and all sorts of gear to get them open. This is a terrible tragedy. The slightly soggy bit of pastry under the lid of a Fray Bentos pie, where it mixes with the dog‑food-style gravy, is one of the peaks of human civilisation.

After the referendum, the prime minister and the Labour leader embarked on parallel journeys, each carrying promises of painless, cost-free release from EU membership. May’s path was harder. Her pledges were snagged on governing reality, skewered by Brussels, hung up on parliamentary arithmetic. Opposition has protected Corbyn from those jagged edges, but he cannot avoid them for ever. Rebellion in the House of Lords has brought them uncomfortably close.The upper chamber has rewritten the EU withdrawal bill so it urges the government to negotiate a much softer Brexit. More than 80 Labour peers defied their whips to support membership of the European Economic Area, thereby preserving British integration in the single market. There are MPs from all parties who will want to endorse that amendment when it comes back to the Commons. They see the EEA as the least-damaging Brexit model: a safety net for jobs and investment.At a factory in Essex today, three political grandees gathered to make that argument: David Miliband, former Labour foreign secretary Nick Clegg, former Liberal Democrat leader and Nicky Morgan, Tory chair of the Treasury select committee. The intended symbolism of the triptych was that averting a hard Brexit is a mission that transcends party boundaries.That message might resonate with some non-aligned voters, but it is hard to imagine a collection of messengers less likely to shift opinion in Corbyn’s camp. The official Labour view is that single market membership is incompatible with the referendum result. That is a facsimile of May’s argument. It is also untrue. The ballot paper had no subsidiary questions on post-EU arrangements. So why is Labour pumping up the tyres on May’s hard Brexit bus?Three reasons stand out. First: a fear of being cast as\u0026nbspEurophile saboteurs. In legal terms, the EEA is not the\u0026nbspEuropean Union, but in cultural terms the accusation\u0026nbspof a sellout resonates with many leave voters. Labour is not polling well enough in areas that voted for Brexit to risk letting off a remain-themed firework in\u0026nbspparliament.Second: squeamishness about immigration policy – EEA membership would preserve free labour movement. That doesn’t have to mean totally unregulated borders: there are mechanisms such as work permits for managing migration from within the single market. But to advertise them, Labour would have to take the initiative on a subject that is fraught with risk. Perceived softness on immigration costs the party votes, while any hardening of rhetoric would jar with Corbyn’s caring brand. By rejecting the single market he can be strict on borders without sounding mean to foreigners.Third: there is ideological hostility to single market rules prohibiting certain forms of industrial subsidy. Those restrictions, it is argued, would obstruct a radical-left economic programme. Whether that is true depends on how radical and how left you want to go. Everything in Corbyn’s 2017 manifesto could have been implemented within existing EU rules. The leader’s office might be fizzing with more drastic anti-capitalist plans, but no one says what they are.The arguments over Labour’s Brexit position are a tangle of dogma, idealism and electoral pragmatism. They don’t map neatly on to the outdated scheme of a Corbynite movement in conflict with a Blairite reaction. There are Momentum activists who burn with the spirit of remain. There are Labour MPs who would bury\u0026nbspCorbynism but also bow to the Eurosceptic will of their constituents.The more fundamental distinction is between those who start from the belief that any Labour government is always better than any alternative, and those who don’t. For tribal loyalists, Brexit strategy is subordinate to the goal of beating the Tories. That is the lens the leadership applies and it would be bizarre if it didn’t. (Whether it makes the right choices to achieve that goal is a different matter.)Then there is the ethos expressed by Miliband, Clegg and Morgan today, that getting Brexit right is in the national interest, bigger than any party. There are Labour backbenchers who have no affection for the current leadership but cannot imagine campaigning in a rosette that isn’t red. But others have crossed that psychological Rubicon. They expect to be driven out of the party before a general election, either by the Corbyn machine or their own consciences. Their allegiance is more remain than Labour. They will vote accordingly.Beyond parliament, tension between pro-European and pro-Labour feelings is strangely submerged. Many of Corbyn’s enthusiastic younger fans are also eager remainers. The leadership strategy seems to be to persuade them that leaving the EU is only a disaster because it is being organised by Tories. Make Jeremy prime minister, the argument goes, and the bad feelings disappear. It is true Corbyn commands phenomenal amounts of trust. But many of his supporters also want to stop Brexit, or at least to vote on it again. And they can see that their leader is less bothered.Corbyn’s eager acceptance of the referendum result could, at first, be lauded as fulfilling his duty as a democrat. The same could just about be said when he voted for article 50 and again when he ran on a pro-Brexit manifesto. When he sacked a shadow cabinet minister who called for another referendum, it was a question of loyalty and discipline … But then, why doesn’t Corbyn want a public vote on the final deal? Why would he whip MPs to abstain in a vote to make Brexit softer? Why take the afternoon off to make a Tory prime minister’s job easier?At some point even the most indulgent audience will see these as the choices of a leader who not only likes Brexit, but likes it hard. Then the question is whether Labour remainers trust Corbyn more than they hate leaving the EU. How far can he test their patience? He seems determined to find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9a6d72250d7905e3b339f97320549a93a30f2ed/0_98_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c212f6b49d06bdc12c2a9edf863de88a","title":"blackkklansman review spike lee adam driver cannes 2018","story":"Lee’s satirical 70s comedy – about a black police officer who infiltrates the Klu Klux Klan – is broad and unsubtle, but hits its targets effectivelySpike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman is a broad satirical comedy of the 70s American race war, and a parable of passing for black and passing for white – based on the true story of Ron Stallsworth, the black Colorado police officer who masterminded the infiltration of a local KKK chapter by posing as a white bigot over the phone and sending in white officers for face-to-face work.With Lee’s knockabout treatment, this stranger-than-fiction story lights up like a barroom pinball machine, pinging and flashing and clattering with N-bombs, blaxploitation tropes, strategic anachronisms and unsubtle premonitions of the New Trump Order. It’s a rephrasing gag-tactic that means that at one point someone actually talks about finding “the means for America to reclaim its former greatness.” The movie actually kicks off with a shrill, harrumphing cameo from Alec Baldwin, the great SNL Trump ventriloquiser himself, playing a white power extremist. But the film’s acrid, patchily maintained comedy finally gives way to direct rhetoric as Lee replaces his period drama with video footage of the present-day Charlottesville far-right violence, and the President’s later claim to detect “very fine people” in their ranks – rather in the way that Lee began his Malcolm X biopic with the infamous Rodney King beating. The director may well wish us to remember this, and ponder how little has changed in a quarter of a century. John David Washington plays Ron, a young black man in Colorado Springs who wishes to join the police force, encouraged by a state-wide affirmative action drive. After a humiliating stint in the records department, in which officers repeatedly ask him to pull the file on “toads”, Ron is moved to undercover work, where he has to spy on a Black Power meeting, wearing a wire, and hating himself, even as he falls for a beautiful and extravagantly afro-ed activist, Patrice (Laura Harrier). The experience humiliates him, but weirdly radicalises him, inspiring him to use the undercover tactic in a new direction. Using his strange talent for mimicking the sonorous voices of white men, and with a need to confront his colleagues with what their unconscious racism sounds like when said out loud, Ron calls the KKK chapter, pretending to be a bigot and rashly uses his real name. Partly out of embarrassment, the police feel they might as well give Ron’s KKK-infiltration plan a try and send in a white Jewish officer Flip (Adam Driver) to win their trust. Flip is hardly less conflicted than Ron. The ironies, combined with the incessant nauseating racist talk, creates a strange miasma for this movie, like an animated tattoo, or bumper sticker. There are punchy moments which do not hesitate to create thumpingly significant contrasts. As the hour of a planned racist terror outrage against black people draws nigh, Lee intercuts between a scene in which Harry Belafonte has a cameo as a veteran activist addressing his audience, and a sequence in which the KKK hold a creepy sub-Masonic ceremony to induct new members. It concludes with explicitly juxtaposing cries of “White power!” with “Black power!” It’s an implied equivalence which makes the drama very self-conscious. BlacKkKlansman sometimes seems to be striving for a savvy bizarreness not unlike David O. Russell’s American Hustle – but also for a kind of Brechtian alienation, a Lehrstück which pointedly uses clips from Gone With The Wind and Birth Of A Nation. Topher Grace has a sinister small role as KKK chief David Duke, imagined as petty desk-bound pen-pusher – although this film certainly gives this ridiculous man plenty of oxygen-publicity, in both his fictional and factual firms. Spike Lee hits his targets effectively enough - again and again. They keep popping back up like the targets in a fairground shooting gallery, and get shot back down again with a clang. In this movie, serious and funny clash into each other like experienced WWE wrestlers. It’s an entertaining spectacle but the brilliant tonal balance in something like Jordan Peele’s satire Get Out leaves this looking a little exposed. Yet it responds fiercely, contemptuously to the crassness at the heart of the Trump regime and gleefully pays it back in its own coin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea18b0427188fb172ac3bae7cb12b6ef4d746a9/0_0_4072_4134/master/4072.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f493c7891b7f6a47164344def9e6830c 1400w","title":"everton likely marco silva sam allardyce rooney","story":"• Portuguese was preferred candidate back in October• Board to meet about Allardyce and Rooney in midweekSam Allardyce is set to leave Everton this week with the former Watford and Hull City manager Marco Silva a leading candidate to replace him.Allardyce is scheduled to meet Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, in the coming days and his departure is expected to be announced by the end of the week. Allardyce is six months into the 18-month contract he secured in November and oversaw an eighth-place finish in the Premier League. But fierce opposition to his management style among the club’s supporters, allied to the hierarchy’s desire for a fresh start following a dreadful season, is likely to result in the 63-year-old leaving with a final year’s pay-off of around £6m.Everton’s board will hold meetings over several key issues this week. It is also expected to hold talks with Wayne Rooney’s representative, Paul Stretford, with the former England captain seeking clarification on his Goodison future before deciding whether to accept an offer to join DC United in the MLS.Silva is the front-runner to succeed Allardyce having been Moshiri’s preferred appointment when he sacked Ronald Koeman on 23 October. Hopes of a swift transition may be complicated, however, by a legal dispute between the Portuguese coach and Watford.Watford sacked Silva in January following a run of one win in 11 matches. The club claimed in a statement that an “unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival” – Everton – led to a significant deterioration in Silva’s focus and results. The manager believed he was sacked prematurely and that he is owed six months’ salary, £750,000, and remains in legal dispute with his former employer over his settlement terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6cd108da991f7c77a5ba3f440c7457c55083eac/0_56_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09deadbaf0c6a1067e65219054eeba4a","title":"fulham derby county championship play off semi final second leg match report","story":"Only time will tell if this highly-charged encounter will help take Fulham back to the promised land of the Premier League. But judging by the electricity that crackled round the old stands of Craven Cottage, there is momentum behind the Cottagers. And they also have Ryan Sessegnon.The teenager scored the first goal of this match and set up the second for Denis Odoi. Kept quiet for much of the game, when his moment arrived in the second minute of the second half, Sessegnon buried it.Fulham had never won a play-off match before, failing on seven occasions against the likes of Grimsby Town and Bristol Rovers. They came into this game having missed automatic promotion at the last and with a 1-0 deficit to overturn. It requires a certain strength of character to flip that kind of record around, and Sessegnon has it. He turns 18 on Friday.Slavisa Jokanovic has been forced to talk about Sessegnon many times already this season, such has been the teenager’s form, with 15 league goals and a place on the PFA young player of the year shortlist already under his belt. The Fulham manager was made to do so again after this match and he put it like this: “He is 17 and he is special. I can’t explain him. I remember what I was like when I was 17, and the level he is at at this age is fantastic. He knows very well what this profession is about it’s focus and concentration,and he made a great job for us.”Quick to shift the focus away from a player who will surely be linked with every club under the sun this summer and may yet have an outside chance of an England call-up, Jokanovic praised the defensive resolution of his side on the night, observing quite accurately that they stymied any Derby hopes on the counterattack. But this performance was more a vindication of his side’s capabilities on the ball, which Jokanovic has been stressing throughout these past two weeks of relative stress.Making one change from the team that lost on Friday night, with the muscular Aboubakar Kamara for Floyd Ayité, Fulham dominated the ball from start to finish, just as they had at Pride Park. Sessegnon might have opened the scoring within eight minutes, only to see his lofted effort turned over the bar by Scott Carson. The former England keeper was outstanding and made his best save of the game at the very end of the opening period, turning a point-blank Alexander Mitrovic header over the bar with his right hand as he ed to his left.The match was scoreless at half-time but it didn’t feel like Derby were going to leave with a clean sheet and, within two minutes of the restart, Sessegnon made sure they wouldn’t. It came from a Matt Targett cross, the Southampton loanee finding Stefan Johansen in the box. The Norwegian got up and chested down to Sessegnon, who was mystifyingly unmarked. With one touch on his chest and the second with that dynamite left boot of his, the ball was soon lashing the roof of the net. Twenty minutes later, Sessegnon curled a corner to the front post and Odoi arced a wonderful header beyond Carson to give Fulham a leader they never looked like surrendering.Gary Rowett was generous enough to admit his side had had it coming. “It’s a difficult enough task to come here and get a clean sheet‚“ he said, “Never mind to stop them scoring for a second game.” The Derby manager criticised his team for what he saw as succumbing to the pressure of such a high-stakes tie. They struggled to create a chance of note in the match, though the absence of their top scorer Matej Vydra who was left out of the starting XI by Rowett, might have factored into that equation.For Derby that is now three play-off defeats in five years and Rowett has a tricky summer ahead working out how to take his experienced and expensive team that one extra step. For Fulham however, the dream is still alive. Craven Cottage was bouncing throughout the match, quite literally in the case of small crowds balanced precariously on balconies in the corners. The noise was not quite what you’d expect from one of the Football League’s more scenic stadiums, but maybe they felt something special was happening.“If I can find some kind of benefits the I start to be interested in statistics” said Jokanovic who had spent the past fortnight denying their significance. “I know that we haven’t played for 43 years at Wembley.“So we are really satisfied and proud. We know how important it is to get there, but it’s more important to show our quality in the final. Now we must clear our minds, rest our bodies and prepare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f6263e59a9d1e7b7820b8b49f0d74f1aaaa3c71/891_244_3805_2284/master/3805.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d65f3b3a3e7971ecd81652bc5d1ee5c","title":"gareth southgate england week off before world cup","story":"• Decision means full squad will have only one friendly together• Harry Kane welcomed decision saying ‘you have to switch off’Gareth Southgate will have his full squad available for only one pre‑World Cup friendly, against Costa Rica in Leeds on 7\u0026nbspJune, with the England manager determined his players should have a week off after the domestic season.Southgate submitted a 35-man provisional squad to Fifa on Monday and will make public his 23-man party for the finals on Wednesday. No major surprises are anticipated with Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who played in the November internationals and has recovered from an ankle problem to impress at Crystal Palace, and the uncapped Trent Alexander-Arnold likely to feature. Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey is not expected to be involved.Southgate decided this year that his players should be allowed to go on holiday before the World Cup, a switch in policy from his predecessor, Roy Hodgson, who had requested clubs release members of his squad for a pre‑Euro\u0026nbsp2016 training camp on the conclusion of the Premier League season. Players were asked to hand over their passports two years ago to demonstrate their commitment with Hodgson wary some had returned unfit after being permitted to go on family breaks before preparations began for previous tournaments.Those not involved in the FA\u0026nbspCup or Champions League finals have been allowed to take this week off before gathering at St\u0026nbspGeorge’s Park on Monday. The contingent from Chelsea and Manchester United will be granted next week off and Liverpool’s Champions League finalists will not be expected to link up until 4\u0026nbspJune, missing the Wembley send‑off against Nigeria and ensuring Southgate will have his full complement of players available only for the game against Costa Rica.The decision to grant time off has been welcomed. “A week is the perfect time,” said Harry Kane, who has departed with his family for the Bahamas. “You stay in shape and look forward to meeting up and training hard and getting ready for the friendlies. It’s not enough time to lose a lot of fitness but it’s a good time to refresh mentally.“I’ll spend a bit of time on the beach with the family, chill and I will do a bit in the gym, not too much, and when we meet up we have got plenty of time until the World Cup to get into top shape.“We go through a lot in the season, with your clubs and countries, so you have got to switch off, maybe for me stay away from everything, leave the phone indoors and just chill and spend time with loved ones.”The Football Association will also honour inidual players’ fitness and recovery programmes with England departing for St Petersburg on 12\u0026nbspJune. The staggered nature of the returns will mean Phil Jones, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Ashley Young join up on 28\u0026nbspMay. It remains to be seen whether Gary Cahill’s late burst of form at Chelsea will earn him a recall but the former vice-captain and Everton’s Michael Keane are far from certain of their inclusion given Southgate may select Jones, John Stones and Harry Maguire as centre-backs, with Kyle Walker and Eric Dier also capable of playing there.Alexander-Arnold trained with the senior England setup while at St\u0026nbspGeorge’s Park with the Under-21s this year and could be picked even with the news positive on Kieran Trippier’s knee injury. Liverpool’s Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain and Joe Gomez have been ruled out through injury but Southgate has made checks on their club-mate Adam Lallana, whose campaign has been severely interrupted by thigh problems.The 30-year-old came off the bench for the last 16 minutes against Brighton on Sunday, his first involvement in six weeks, and he made a solitary league start all season. If selected, he could waive his week off and go straight into training with the squad once Liverpool have returned from Kiev.There had been calls for Shelvey, capped four times, to return to the fold for the first time since September 2015 after some impressive displays as Newcastle secured a top-half finish in the Premier League. Southgate is understood to be less inclined to pick the midfielder with doubts over the 26‑year‑old’s temperament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055bf471d068545b95d70d3d3589b8f964e72eb6/70_66_1807_1084/master/1807.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e826165bce03830a031e243335665fb","title":"harry kane mo salah golden boot new heights tottenham liverpool","story":"Mauricio Pochettino wants his demand for bravery and risk-taking in the summer transfer market to extend to swift decisions over the players he is willing to sell – namely Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld.The Tottenham manager is determined to improve his squad after a third-place Premier League finish in order to take the final step to trophies next season and he would love Daniel Levy, the chairman, to sanction a massive investment drive.In his heart Pochettino knows that is unrealistic he will continue to have to balance signings with outgoings because of the repayment costs associated with the club’s £850m new stadium.Yet he is keen for there to be clarity over the assets in the squad on which he could cash in – and it means doing early business with them to give him greater flexibility on his signings. The transfer window in England closes on 8 August.It will doubtless disappoint some fans and players that Pochettino is prepared to consider offers for Dembélé – most of the playing staff rate the midfielder as their No 1 team‑mate. But there are concerns over his fitness – whether he can stay the course, in physical terms, for another season in England.Dembélé had ankle surgery last summer, started this season slowly and finished it back in the treatment room with an ankle injury. The 30-year-old could be tempted by a final major pay day in China, where Beijing Guoan are interested in him. He has one year to run on his contract.Rose blotted his copybook last August when he gave an interview in which he urged the club to sign more world-class players and made plain his frustrations at the wage structure. Everton want the left-back this summer.Alderweireld’s situation has been well documented. Tottenham stand to lose him for £25m next summer because of a release clause in his contract and consequently they are keen to get more for him now. The centre-half has played six times for the club since 1 November, when he injured a hamstring, and the problem could be that his suitors would want him to prove his form and fitness at the World Cup for Belgium before they move for him.Pochettino was outspoken after his team’s final game of the season on Sunday – the 5-4 Wembley win against Leicester – when he prodded Levy over squad strengthening. It felt as though he was flexing his muscles from a position of power, the club having once again qualified for the Champions League, and it might not be coincidence that Pochettino is in talks over a new contract.Pochettino was also seeking to mark his turf over the type of player he wants to sign. Typically Levy has preferred younger ones with resale value but Pochettino would like him to consider more seasoned professionals.Harry Kane has said the emergence of Mohamed Salah at Liverpool has driven him to new heights. The Tottenham striker finished the season with a career-best 30 Premier League goals, though it was not enough for him to win the Golden Boot for a third year in succession.Salah took the award with 32 goals, a record for a 38-game season. Kane scored 25 in 2015-16 and 29 in 2016-17 and he got 21 in 2014-15 when he finished as runner-up to Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero in the Golden Boot. The 24-year-old is determined to maintain his upward path and has set himself the target of bettering Salah’s total.“I am looking forward to the competition again next season,” Kane said. “I haven’t seen Mo to talk with him. But this is what you want at the highest level – you want to be fighting for things and I think we pushed each other. He broke the record for a 38-game season and that is what I will try to do next season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309b2ae262623202fc993916a2b7d7e12c358bde/0_279_5172_3105/master/5172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a65743239b5fd910a2280abf5478d60","title":"arsenal the arsene wenger years in pictures","story":"As Arsène Wenger prepares to hang up his famous coat for the last time, we take a look at some of the highs and lows of his career at Arsenal, as seen through the lens of  and Observer photographer Tom Jenkins "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1651037032e95965f8e7f2923b593a03c9b55007/487_973_5055_3034/master/5055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c576395fa97d3783ba9cdbb2e10cc6d4","title":"life microcephaly afghanistan in pictures","story":"In an impoverished country where support is limited at best, people with disabilities must look to their families for help.

The Coca-Colas were kept ice cold, and appear as essential to her writing routine as quiet and light. Those who pledged $50 or more to the crowdfunding of Griffin’s film received a copy of her personal cookbook. A scrapbook of food clippings from magazines, menus of the meals she served at dinner parties (for Patti Smith she made chicken hash with roasted yellow peppers and baguettes) and food-stained recipes, handwritten, with terse crossing-outs, its most revealing page was the recipe for a parsley salad, less as an illustration of her diet, or even for the way its sparse style reflects her prose, but more as an insight into her social reach: the salad feeds up to 40.It’s not just that her recipes reveal her – reading her work you see Didion discovers herself this way too. In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”.Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch.It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e81fcd6b29a327bca255d656114d7e10885984d/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c146ed8961c4eef1e7d463a7eafe8da9","title":"david miliband nick clegg nicky morgan new brexit supergroup","story":"Morgan, Clegg and Miliband unveil their anti-Brexit initiative. A shame no one was listeningThe remain fightback starts here. In a rice factory in Essex. For one night only, live from the Tilda Pyramid stage, in front of an audience of at least a few dozen, I give you a gala performance of Those We Have Loved. Featuring Nicky Morgan on lead vocals, David Miliband on lead guitar and Nick Clegg on drums. Sometimes you don’t know what you don’t really want until they’ve gone.“Hello Tilda,” Morgan yelled, before segueing seamlessly into her greatest Brexit hits. The leavers were engaged in a collective act of self-delusion and it was time for MPs to put the national interest first and stay in the customs union and the single market. Miliband and Clegg then got to do their brief solos, which more or less echoed what Morgan had already said. Then it was all over. Thank you and good night.Once the four-second ovation had died down, it was time for the encore. Or at least questions. Most of which verged on the existential. Why them? Why now? Why here? Hadn’t all this already been said countless times already? No one really seemed to have a very satisfactory answer. Some things just were what they were.The greatest confusion centred on why Miliband had suddenly decided to drop in on the UK after five years in the US to give us his Brexit thoughts. David appeared nonplussed. His was the highest calling. He was here because he was the Saviour™. And it was his duty to come back every now and again to remind us of what we were missing. That’s what Saviours™ did. They let us know how things could have been if only we had kept the faith. It was his act of kindness to an ungrateful nation.It had been like this: he had been hanging out in New York, jamming with a few dudes, when he’d got the phone call from Nick and Nicky. And he just couldn’t resist the chance of playing a UK gig with such iconic political figures. So he’d dropped everything, taken the red-eye – business class, of course: every Messiah deserved a break – to London, done a quick tour of the Today studios and here he was. Playing to 20,000 bags of rice. You Win a Grain.“Bregsit is a tragedy,” he crooned. He pronounces Brexit in exactly the same way as Tony Blair. It must be a New Labour thing. “But it doesn’t have to be a choice between a hard Bregsit and a chaotic Bregsit.”Did this signal a return to British politics, or was it just a one-off appearance? “It’s not the beginning, middle or end of anything,” Miliband said gnomically. He wasn’t here to start a new cross-party anti-Bregsit group. He was just here. To make a contribution. To serve and to save. He might be back at some point. And there again, he might not be. He was like the wind. A prophet is not without honour except in his own land. David wiped away a tear.It wasn’t long before someone asked about the artistic differences in the 2010 supergroup, the Dave and Ed Mili Band. Were the two brothers still talking after that difficult second album? David suddenly went all coy. What went on between him and Ed had always been private and he was going to keep it that way. Which came as news to everyone who had witnessed their very public bust-up over the leadership of the Labour party.Morgan then fielded a few questions before realising that no one had wanted to ask Clegg anything. The drummer’s lot. She generously chose to allow him to have the last word. “Never underestimate the narcissism of the Brexiters,” he declared.And never underestimate the narcissism of former politicians who fail to realise that the public is no longer that interested in what they have to say. Who just can’t bear to confront the silence of their mortality. David, Nick and Nicky had spoken. But almost no one had listened. Though maybe that had been the point all along. As a metaphor for the futility of Brexit, it couldn’t have been bettered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7c164f48fd704ebfd81a7a07bf5efe276182c3/0_3_3056_1832/master/3056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af0ffa67b59a2f72bc78c7b2e7ca88aa","title":"labour shortlists candidates for lewisham east byelection","story":"Four candidates vying to stand for party in next month’s byelection will be put to members’ vote at hustings this weekendA former Ken Livingstone adviser, an anti-Transatlantic trade treaty activist, Lewisham’s deputy mayor and a former mayoral candidate have been shortlisted by Labour for the election to succeed Heidi Alexander in Lewisham East.Labour’s national executive committee has shortlisted Claudia Webbe, Brenda Dacres, Janet Daby and Sakina Sheikh as its four candidates who will be put to a members’ vote at a hustings this weekend.Webbe is the most senior figure in the party of the four candidates, a current member of the NEC and a former adviser to Livingstone at City Hall.

Momentum’s national coordinating group will interview both Webbe and Sheikh to discuss which candidate to endorse.Councillor Brenda Dacres, who stood unsuccessfully to be Lewisham mayor earlier this year, said she was motivated to stand by the Windrush scandal, as a single mother whose parents were from the Windrush generation.

The selection is set to be a fierce battle between Momentum activists, trade unionists and Labour centrists, who control the local party’s executive, though Lewisham Momentum is currently rife with internal isions.A Momentum source said the seat could be “a real tough battle” for the left in the local party. The shortlist means, whatever the outcome, Lewisham East will have an ethnic minority woman as its Labour candidate. Labour has drawn some criticism in recent months for its parliamentary selections in marginal seats, where no ethnic minority women have been selected at all, despite more than 60 selections taking place since the June election. Labour MPs David Lammy and Tulip Siddiq and Operation Black Vote’s Simon Woolley are among those who have called for the party to step up efforts to choose BAME candidates.The speed of the selection process had drawn anger from some local activists in Lewisham East. The constituency party met overnight to draw up their own unofficial shortlist – an attempt to put pressure on the NEC panel to select some of their preferred candidates for the final hustings.The local party chair, Ian McKenzie, who had accused party bosses of a “stitch-up”, told the  both Daby and Dacres had also made the shortlist drawn up by local activists.The Labour leadership and the leftwing grassroots group Momentum are widely reported to prefer Webbe and Sheikh. Leftwing figures in the party are thought to be cautious about selecting Webbe, the former chair of Operation Trident, because she is a member of Labour’s NEC. Were she to resign from the finely balanced committee, her replacement could be a Corbyn-sceptic candidate.PCS equalities representative Phyll Opoku-Gyimah was widely seen as the frontrunner for the seat but unexpectedly dropped out of the race on Sunday, citing personal circumstances. Comments by Opoku-Gyimah comparing the Israel-Palestinian conflict to the Holocaust were unearthed by the Guido Fawkes blog at the weekend.Alexander, the former shadow health secretary who quit Corbyn’s frontbench during the string of resignations over his leadership in 2016, has resigned her seat to take up a role as deputy mayor for transport under the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, at City Hall.

He emphasised the need to unite both leave and remain supporters, according to a senior Labour source.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.EEA membership, often described as the Norway option gives countries full access to the EU’s internal market, allowing it to trade goods with EU states without customs fees, except food and drinks which are subsidised by the EU. Iceland and Liechtenstein are also members of the EEA, but the terms mean accepting freedom of movement and, as a non-EU state, the UK would have to accept EU regulations with no seat at the table in Brussels.MP John Mann warned that Labour would lose seats like his in Bassetlaw if it was perceived that the party had “watered down” its Brexit position.Other Labour MPs also cautioned against any option which would mean retaining free movement. Sources said MPs warned colleagues that consideration of an EEA option would leave Labour vulnerable not just with leave voters, but the large percentage of remain voters who also wanted changes to free movement.Others at the meeting made passionate speeches in favour of keeping an open mind about a Norway-style option. One source said Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit select committee, said Corbyn should not take options off the table.Several Labour MPs in the room said Corbyn had not been definitive in his opposition to EEA membership, and did not categorically rule it out, but Mann said the strength of feeling in the room from other speakers against the option had “killed it off”.“It was more than half the people that spoke, it was quite a significant moment in my view,” Mann said. “It was people who have not spoken out before, from areas like mine. They have never voted in favour of Brexit before, they voted remain.”A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.A senior Labour source said whipping arrangements for the EEA amendment passed by the Lords had not been discussed for when the EU withdrawal bill returned to parliament, but said Corbyn had made his opposition to a Norway-style deal.“Jeremy made clear that from our point of view, we have set out our priorities for the Brexit negotiations, including negotiating a new customs union with the EU with Britain having a day in trade details, and a new and strong relationship with the single market, retaining the benefits ... we’ve set that out since the beginning,” the source said.“The EEA packages that are currently in existence do not meet the needs and priorities that we’ve set out and the Norway option is not appropriate and will not work for the kind of Brexit we want to see.”Separately, Labour sources said MP Wes Streeting challenged Corbyn in the meeting about the party’s local government election result in Barnet, where Labour failed to take the council amid accusations of antisemitism in the party.A Labour source said Corbyn “does think antisemitism played a role in the Barnet election result ... Jeremy made clear as he set out in public statements, he is determined to eradicate anti-semitism in the party and will not tolerate it”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779372983fb1dd65affdacc46f7ea34987eeed4e/0_885_2550_1529/master/2550.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8263b65a9ddcd8184ce2aa764a6d50b","title":"europa moon of jupiter prime candidate for alien life after water blast found","story":"Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft flew through a giant plume of water that erupted from the icy surface of Europa, new analysis showsA Nasa probe that explored Jupiter’s moon Europa flew through a giant plume of water vapour that erupted from the icy surface and reached a hundred miles high, according to a fresh analysis of the spacecraft’s data.The discovery has cemented the view among some scientists that the Jovian moon, one of four first spotted by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610, is the most promising place in the solar system to hunt for alien life.If such geysers are common on Europa, Nasa and European Space Agency (Esa) missions that are already in the pipeline could fly through and look for signs of life in the brine, which comes from a vast subsurface ocean containing twice as much water as all the oceans on Earth.Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft spent eight years in orbit around Jupiter and made its closest pass over Europa, a moon about the size of our own, on 16 December 1997. As the probe dropped beneath an altitude of 250 miles, its sensors twitched with unexpected signals that scientists were unable to explain at the time.Now, in a new study, the researchers describe how they went back to the Galileo data after grainy images beamed home from the Hubble space telescope in 2016 showed what appeared to be plumes of water blasting from Europa’s surface. They found that a sudden blast of water from the Jovian moon explained the Galileo probe’s strange measurements.“There were some anomalous features in that close pass in December 1997 that we never fully understood,” said Margaret Kivelson, a senior scientist on the Galileo mission and emeritus professor of space physics at the University of California in Los Angeles. “We went back and looked at them more carefully and found that they were just what you’d expect if we’d flown through a plume.”On its closest flyby, Galileo swept over Europa at more than 2,230 mph. As it hurtled past, instruments onboard the probe detected a brief but dramatic twist in the magnetic field and a sudden, rapid increase in the density of plasma, or ionised gas, the spacecraft was flying through. Computer simulations created by Xianzhe Jia, a space scientist at the University of Michigan, showed that a 120-mile-high geyser erupting from a relatively warm patch on Europa would create precisely the same readings. Details of the work appear in the journal Nature Astronomy.When plumes of water spray out of Europa, the molecules are immediately battered by highly energetic particles, a process that smashes them into charged ions. It is these ions that produce rapid swings in the magnetic field direction and ramp up the density of plasma above the geyser.“Our detection of a plume based on the Galileo data certainly strengthens the case for future exploration of Europa,” Jia said. One Nasa mission, Europa Clipper, is scheduled to launch in the 2020s with the express aim of finding out whether the Jovian moon could harbour life. Another mission, Esa’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, is expected to launch around the same time and perform flybys of Europa and two other Jovian moons, Ganymede and Callisto.“Given the evidence of plumes available so far, there is a good chance that those spacecraft may obtain direct measurements of plumes ejecting material from the subsurface ocean into space,” said Jia. “Those observations will provide crucial information for us to assess Europa’s potential for life.”As much as scientists may wish it to be otherwise, the Jovian moon is hardly a balmy haven. The surface temperature never rises above -160C (-256F). What warmth there is comes largely from tidal kneading driven by the massive gravitational forces that come with an orbit around Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system. If life has gained what passes for a foothold on Europa, it may be huddled around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean in a world of frigid, perpetual night.William Sparks, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and leader of the team that found evidence for water plumes on Europa with Hubble, said it was good to have independent confirmation of the watery blasts.“Europa is a moon of Jupiter that is about the same size as our moon, but it’s got more ocean on it than planet Earth,” Sparks said. “It is completely engulfed by this saline ocean which lies beneath a crust of ice, and in terms of a places to host extant life, I think it’s the best location that we’ve got beyond planet Earth. It would be good to find out what is really there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2f310a78d1f029a668ce9fcb6a33aa835e61c24/0_169_4757_2854/master/4757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f1e98ba2fb8da69699adf7aa8f771b","title":"exercise is good for you unless its part of your job","story":"Scientists find physically demanding jobs are linked to greater risk of early deathMen who work as labourers or in other physically demanding roles have a greater risk of dying early than those with more sedentary jobs, researchers say.The finding, from scientists in the Netherlands, reveals an apparent “physical activity paradox” where exercise can be harmful at work but beneficial to health when performed in leisure time.Pieter Coenen, a public health researcher at VU University medical centre in Amsterdam, said the reason for the disparity is unclear, but he believes it may reflect the different types of exercise people get at work compared with those in their free time.Other researchers say the finding may simply reflect a greater likelihood for people in manual labouring jobs to have unhealthier lifestyles in which diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all conspire to reduce life expectancy.But Coenen believes other factors are at play. “If you go out for a run for half an hour in your leisure time,” he said, “that increases your heart rate and you feel well afterwards, but when you are physically active at work, it’s a very different type of activity. You are working for eight hours a day and have limited rest periods. You are lifting, doing repetitive movements, and manual handling.“Our hypothesis is that these kinds of activities actually strain your cardiovascular system rather than help you to improve the fitness of your cardiovascular system.”International public health guidelines encourage people to spend half an hour a day on moderate to intense physical activity to keep healthy, but previous research has shown that those who work in construction and other physically demanding jobs are the least likely to exercise in their leisure time. “They are in double trouble,” said Coenen. “They don’t benefit from the good aspects of leisure-time activity, and they are exposed to the risk of occupational physical activity.”To investigate the effects of exercise on health, the scientists combined the results from 17 published studies, giving them data on nearly 200,000 people. Most of the studies they included took lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake, into account, but Coenen concedes that not all of the studies completely ruled out their harmful effects.In light of the findings, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Coenen believes more should be done to encourage people in manual work to follow the standard guidelines on exercise, and not be fooled into thinking that they got enough at work. “Even if you are physically active at work, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to be physically active in your leisure time,” he said.Mark Hamer, who studies exercise as medicine at Loughborough University, believes the findings can be explained by manual and office workers having very different lifestyles. He points to a study last year of half a million people in China that found physical activity had health benefits whether it was at work or in leisure time.“The message I would give is that people should try to follow the physical activity guidelines regardless of what they do for a job,” Hamer said. “And people should be thinking about their lifestyles more generally, because that is likely to be at the root of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59925b09acf9b4f3afa6f4ce739226f0f0e3190f/0_114_520_312/master/520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db132adb628b6ebbdee23e04827025b","title":"new chemical compound stops common cold in its tracks rhinovirus","story":"Scientists working on human cells in a dish find new way to tackle rhinovirus – though a cure is a long way offIt’s a conundrum that has stumped scientists for centuries, but now researchers say they have taken a tantalising step forward in the quest to tackle the common cold.The scourge of workplace, home and school playground, the common cold is predominantly caused by the rhinovirus. But attempts to thwart the pathogen by vaccination or antiviral drugs face a number of difficulties – not least because the virus comes in many forms and can mutate rapidly leading to drug resistance.But now scientists say they have discovered a way to nobble the virus that could one day help those with conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis, for whom a cold is not merely a nuisance but a serious health risk.The trick, the authors say, is to develop drugs that interact with one of the enzymes within our cells – an approach that makes it harder for the virus to become drug-resistant.“Viruses hijack the host to make more copies of themselves. This enzyme is one of the host enzymes that the virus hijacks,” said Roberto Solari, visiting professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, and a co-author of the study. Writing in the journal Nature Chemistry, a team of researchers based around the UK report how they looked at molecules that interact with a human enzyme that attaches a type of fatty acid molecule on to proteins. While two of these molecules on their own had little effect on the enzyme, the team found that when they were chemically stitched together they became remarkably potent in preventing the enzyme from working as normal.Solari said that is important, since the virus uses the enzyme to assemble the protein coat which surrounds the genetic material of the virus. “What we found is if we block the addition of this fat, the coat doesn’t assemble so the virus doesn’t package its genes into its coat,” he said. “The virus still makes its own genes, it makes the coat, but the coat can’t assemble so the virus can’t replicate – you actually don’t make infectious particles.” The team say the molecule appears to completely prevent the virus from replicating, whether it is added one hour before, one hour after or at the same time as the cells are infected, and that it remains effective up to three hours after infection. The approach was also found to prevent the replication of other viruses in the same family as rhinovirus – including polio and foot-and-mouth disease.But Solari said a cure for the common cold is a long way off: the drug will need to undergo further developments and optimisation before it can be used as a medication, while tests have so far only been carried out on human cells in a dish.“We haven’t done any animal studies, and we obviously haven’t done any studies in humans, so I can’t tell you formally what the animal toxicity of this compound is,” said Solari, adding that it is also unclear whether the approach would work by the time symptoms of a cold appear – typically a few days after infection. “There is a still a long way before this becomes a medicine,” he said.And, even if the latest discovery does eventually lead to a way to treat colds, its use is likely to be limited to those with respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, for whom a catching a cold can be dangerous.“Rhinovirus, the common cold virus, in healthy people is pretty trivial – you have the runny nose, you have a bit of a temperature, you don’t feel well for two or three days, but you get over it,” said Solari.

The procedure sensitised the animals so that when they were prodded in a fleshy spout called a siphon, they contracted their gills in a robust defensive action. Glanzman likens the reaction to being jumpy in the moments after an earthquake: the memory of the event induces an involuntary reflex to any loud noise.After sensitising the sea snails, Glanzman extracted RNA from the animals and injected it into other sea snails to see what happened. He found the recipient sea snails became sensitised, suggesting the “memory” of the electrical shocks had been transplanted. When Glanzman repeated the experiment with RNA from sea snails that had been hooked up to wires but not shocked, the reflex behaviour did not transfer.According to the researchers, the experiments show how essential parts of the memory trace, or engram, that gives rise to sea hare sensitisation are held in RNA, rather than in the connectivity of brain cells as traditional neuroscience dictates.“What we are talking about are very specific kinds of memories, not the sort that says what happened to me on my fifth birthday, or who is the president of the United States,” said Glanzman, whose study appears in the journal eNeuro. The work has not found widespread acceptance. “Obviously further work needs to be carried out to determine whether these changes are robust and what are the underlying mechanisms,” said Prof Seralynne Vann, who studies memory at Cardiff University. “While the Aplysia is a fantastic model for studying basic neuroscience, we must be very careful in drawing comparisons to human memory processes, which are much more complex.”Tomás Ryan, who studies memory at Trinity College Dublin, is firmly unconvinced. “It’s interesting, but I don’t think they’ve transferred a memory,” he said. “This work tells me that maybe the most basic behavioural responses involve some kind of switch in the animal and there is something in the soup that Glanzman extracts that is hitting that switch.”But Ryan added that radical thinking about memory was sorely needed: “In a field like this which is so full of dogma, where we are waiting for people to retire so we can move on, we need as many new ideas as possible. This work takes us down an interesting road, but I have a huge amount of scepticism about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a389542af3af1243bd3fcae155107b16df7be2/0_204_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64db4b849ddf1f9298135a6b538cdef8","title":"invest sure start tribute tessa jowell government urged labour","story":"Labour calls for increased commitment to early years scheme late MP helped set upMinisters have come under pressure to increase their commitment to Sure Start early years centres as a tribute to their political architect, Tessa Jowell, who died of brain cancer at the weekend.Labour MPs lined up to urge the government to invest in the flagship programme, which was established by the Labour government in 1998 to help give disadvantaged children the best possible start in life. The former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell urged Damian Hinds, the education secretary, to “look again” at the scheme, which has transformed hundreds of thousands of lives across the country.More than 3,000 centres were opened during Labour’s years in power, but hundreds were closed after the coalition government came to power in 2010, a move that Jowell described as heartbreaking. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who was Jowell’s parliamentary aide during her time as shadow Olympics minister, told the : “Sure Start was one of Tessa’s greatest achievements. She knew how important family life was to her and how important strong families in particular are to disadvantaged children.“She was desperate when the programme was scaled back to such a great extent across the country. She had hoped there had been a cross-party consensus behind it that would protect it. “In the last few days the number of people who have spoken up to talk about what it means to them is one of the things she would’ve been proudest of, and demonstrates why Sure Start matters so much and ought to be reinstated.”Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, hailed Jowell’s role in setting up the programme. She told MPs: “When I was a young mum, it was the Sure Start centre that really helped me and my son. And for all that’s said and done in this chamber, that is the best that any honourable member can hope to have achieved.”Yvette Cooper described Jowell, a former cabinet minister, as the “mother of Sure Start”. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “The greatest tribute the government could pay to her would be to begin again the proper funding of her most important achievement: Sure Start.”Hinds told MPs he shared the view on “the fundamental importance of the early years” but declined to make any promises, speaking instead about the importance of home life and nursery care, as well as early years centres, in boosting life chances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f12e85fc5ded6fa6e0dadc47916dd0bd645a18b3/238_266_3297_1978/master/3297.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfaf2cf0fb3e992c0253dd0168919ba","title":"colin graves hundred definite starter","story":"Colin Graves, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has insisted its new 100-ball tournament will definitely go ahead in 2020 and is needed because the younger generation is “just not attracted” to the sport in its current guises.The ECB had appeared to be softening on the introduction of a fourth format during its conversations with the Professional Cricketers’ Association last week, telling the union it was “not set in stone” and just a “concept” following player concerns over the new eight-team competition’s move away from Twenty20.But Graves, speaking on Monday to the BBC, has hardened the governing body’s position on The Hundred – only the 10-ball over remains up for debate – and reiterated the assertion that the two-and-a-half-hour length for matches has not been dictated by the broadcasters. Asked if the 100-ball tournament was set in stone, despite a largely negative public response, Graves replied: “Yes, as far as we and the ECB board is concerned.”It was Graves who two years ago described the existing T20 Blast played by the 18 first-class counties as “mediocre” compared to the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League. In his latest offering the 70-year-old offered a similar verdict when he outlined why a new tournament is needed. “It is not attracting the audiences, if it was we would not have that issue,” Graves said.“The younger generation, whether you like it our not, are just not attracted to cricket. In all the work, surveys and research we have done, the younger generation want something different. They want more excitement, they want it shorter and simpler to understand. Those are the things we have learnt for this new competition and that is what we have to make it.”This came on the same day the ECB announced 50,000 children aged five to eight years old had signed up to its All Stars Cricket coaching programme – up 13,000 on the first year – while it should also be noted that in the T20 Blast last summer 900,000 tickets were sold, nearly treble the number of six years earlier.As well addressing The Hundred, Graves was asked about the controversial allocation of compensation payments to Test counties in years they miss out on staging a match, including the £2.5m given to Glamorgan for not applying to be a Test host during the major match allocation from 2020-24.This money has already appeared in the Welsh club’s accounts for 2017 but its allocation is now set to be reviewed by the Good Governance Institute at the request of the ECB. It was also queried by two senior directors, Andy Nash and Richardson Thompson, when they resigned from their positions before the board’s reorganisation this month.Graves said: “No payments have been made to counties at all, full stop. I floated an idea talking to four or five county chairmen, that would need to be agreed by the board to go any further. No payments have been made. No payments have been promised. End of conversation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/424e52fb8aadfbcba8eaa67a6d0f3b3fec505d6a/7_216_4355_2612/master/4355.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d62efa7a4b096590710e790ddac6690","title":"fiji olympic final sevens rugby union coach ben ryan gold medal coach","story":"“I much preferred Fiji – even with a dictator in charge, a boss who was convicted for manslaughter, my phone being bugged, the bankruptcy and black magic – than my last year at the RFU,” says Ben Ryan, as he sips on a double espresso and reminisces about an extraordinary journey that culminated in him guiding Fiji’s sevens side to Olympic gold in Rio.We are in a cafe not far from Twickenham, where Ryan worked for six years as the England sevens coach before falling foul of what he calls the Rugby Football Union’s “machiavellian” struggles for power and influence, “with people above you who can only be trusted never to be trustworthy”.Ryan applied to become Fiji coach after a friend texted him to say he had seen it advertised on Twitter. One 3am interview by Skype later he was offered the job – and on a whim he accepted. “It was scary and risky,” he admits. “But it’s the best decision I’ve ever made.”Initially he wondered whether he had made the biggest mistake of his life. It did not help that when he took his first training session there was no kit or water and only a couple of balls to practise with – or that he was not paid for six months.There were other challenges, too. At his first tournament he passed a player who had built a tower of 10 pains au chocolat each with a fried egg on top for breakfast – a meal the player considered healthy because he was getting plenty of protein. And just before the 2016 Olympics one of his players, Pio Tuwai, was convulsing in his room saying he had been possessed by a witchdoctor. “His eyes were rolling – it was very bizarre,” Ryan says.Many players were also very poor. Jerry Tuwai lived with his family in a one-room shack with corrugated-iron walls, no running water, gas or electricity, but was moulded by Ryan into one of the heartbeats of the team.But whatever clouds he faced always evaporated on the pitch. “It was absolutely joyful,” he says, beaming at the memories. “We weren’t chucking GPS units on. I wasn’t getting my boss telling me they’re only allowed 10 minutes’ contact a week. It was the purest form of rugby and I loved it.”Yet Ryan says the culture of the squad was just as important to Fiji’s success. Of all the stories he tells, one stands out: in 2015 the squad were on a plane when two passengers collapsed with suspected heart attacks. While the stewards revived them, his team got to their feet and took over the job of serving lunch and drinks to the rest of the plane. “They went down the aisles, handing out napkins and asking passengers whether they wanted chicken or fish,” Ryan says. “It wasn’t a stunt and they weren’t prompted. It was just a natural thing to do for them – to be nice. But that’s what we had as a group. Of course we worked hard. But none of the senior management team ever shouted at the players. And we had fun.”Never was that more evident than in August 2016 when Fiji’s 43-7 destruction of Great Britain in the final  earned the country the first Olympic medal in its history. After what he had seen from his players in the tunnel, Ryan knew his team were going to win.“I can think of dozens of occasions where I’ve been more nervous than that Olympic final,” he says. “Honestly, hand on heart, there wasn’t any of that feeling – we were so relaxed beforehand I knew we were going to win.“My captain, Osea Kolinisau, once said to me: ‘If you’re ever in a tunnel and you’re opposite a Fijian that’s smiling, you’d really better watch out.’ It’s their perfect state, they’re relaxed but ruthless. They are the loveliest people off the field but they can switch to being ultimately very ruthless on the field.”But life was not always perfect. Ryan moved to Fiji having not done due diligence and only later discovered the Fijileaks website, with its tales of corruption, bribery and prisons stacked with political opponents.He is unusually guarded when it comes to talking about Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who seized power in a military coup in 2006, had a keen interest in rugby – as well as his brother-in-law Francis Kean, the president of the Fiji Rugby Union who served time in jail for kicking a man to death. He soon understood not to make eye contact with Bainimarama in meetings and let him dominate the grip when the pair shook hands.Would he go ever back to Twickenham? “It’s something I’ve thought about a lot,” he says. “Not on the performance side but I would seriously consider a role that involved getting more state school kids to play rugby.”For now Ryan is happy doing consultancy work with French Rugby, World Rugby and UK Sport. And while he will not comment directly on speculation he is on a shortlist for the head coach role at Harlequins, he does admit part of him would love to apply his philosophy to the 15-man game.“I would like to prove that with 15s you can succeed by playing a style of rugby that empowers the players, isn’t overly attritional and where everyone in the squad is treated with kindness and respect,” he says. “But it’s never going to be a deathbed regret if such an opportunity doesn’t happen.”Meanwhile, despite Fiji’s gold medal, he wonders how much has really changed. “The Fijian boys are paid only about £4,000-£6,000 a year,” he says. “Sadly they don’t want to pay the boys the same money as a government minister, say, because they feel there’s so many people waiting to take a player’s place. They can be thrown away and discarded, and they don’t value that as much.“It’s very sad,” he adds, the pain evident, “but there’s no legacy in Fiji. Only another day and another struggle.”• Sevens Heaven, The Beautiful Chaos of Fiji’s Olympic Dream by Ben Ryan, is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson on 31 May, priced £20"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2b5fc1bed0fa7d9f6a450fe5b29381b46b9e5d/0_438_5152_3090/master/5152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b87c328468055216e94db26202eac541","title":"johanna konta knocks out rybarikova again italian open","story":"Optimism laughs at the scoreboard at all levels of sport and, in different circumstances, Serena Williams and Johanna Konta took the concept to its outer edges on Monday, two weeks before the French Open.Williams, who is 36 and has played a handful of matches since winning the 2017 Australian Open when seven weeks pregnant, is a contender at Roland Garros, according to her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.“Serena will play the French Open to win it,” he told the WTA’s website of her bid to lift a 24th grand slam title, despite pulling out of Madrid last week then Rome to build on her fitness at his academy in Nice. “Can she do it? Serena can achieve anything. After being her coach for six years I’m even more sure of that statement.”Konta’s forecast may not be so grand. She has yet to win a grand slam title and has not got out of the first round in Paris in three visits, losing last year to Hsieh Su-wei, a doubles specialist ranked 109 in the world at the time. However, she said: “I still maintain I have never not liked clay and I am really enjoying playing on the surface this year.”The evidence is not overwhelming. She lost to the world No\u0026nbsp219 Fanny Stollar on the clay of Charleston last month, then the American qualifier Bernarda Pera (97) in Madrid. So the former top-tenner felt entitled to take heart from a tough but welcome victory over Magdalena Rybarikova at the Italian Open – her fourth on the spin in their rivalry.Konta also got the better of the Slovak in Madrid before losing to Pera and, despite hitting 40 unforced errors in one hour and 50 minutes to win 6-4, 6-3, she was smilingly upbeat.Having slipped out of the top 10 to 22 in the world, Konta undergoes further examination of her cheery resolve in the second round, when she plays either lucky loser Aryna Sabalenka or Hsieh.It is not a prospect that bothers her. “I seem to play the same people, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I play her,” she said, laughing.Rybarikova, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon last year, was bumped up in the seedings here when Petra Kvitova, Konta’s scheduled opponent, withdrew at the last minute, exhausted, after winning the Spanish title on Sunday.Four places ahead of Konta in the world rankings, Rybarikova stretched the first set to nearly an hour when Konta might have wrapped it up in half that time if overcooked backhands had not let her down in key moments. Nevertheless she maintained: “I felt good on both sides.”In the peerless setting of Court Pietrangeli, Konta had five chances to break in the first set before crunching out nine points in a row on her opponent’s serve, then slowly found more rhythm in the second set.In all Rybarikova rescued her serve 11 of 16 times. On Konta’s second match point, a call went against her serve and, replaying the point, she looked relieved to force a closing mistake from her opponent.In Konta’s view there are way more positives than negatives. “I am moving well on the surface, I am a little clearer on how I want to play and also on how to keep my game as it is, because it is effective on the clay as it is on the grass and the hard. I am doing a better job this season to not really change something that doesn’t need to be changed.”She may prove to be right. There was at least evidence to suggest that, when her groundstrokes are flowing and she hits flat and hard to the corners, not many players can live with her. Her challenge this week and in Paris is to string enough of the good stuff together to go deep in the draw.Then, as she dissected her performance, she sniffled and said: “I’ve got a bit of a cold but all good. Wecrack on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec478005efff6ec152e883cb6f92bb40ac17b9c/14_187_4673_2803/master/4673.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a126b385f4ba8738be165e41d123f7f4","title":"tiger woods fairytale golf","story":"Woods has performed brilliantly simply to be competitive again but his shortcomings are obviousThere is a recurring danger of sporting dreams blurring reality. The hype around Tiger Woods was once justified but the reality of recent months applies context often missing in the giddy analysis. Woods has performed brilliantly simply to be competitive again after physical trouble so acute he struggled to sit down for dinner. But there, for now, the story ends.Woods’ latest outing at the Players Championship had him finish seven –almost two shots per round – adrift of the winner Webb Simpson. The 42-year-old tied 55th the previous weekend in Charlotte, 32nd at the Masters and trailed the victorious Rory McIlroy by eight at the conclusion of the Arnold Palmer Invitational.Woods’ share of second at the Valspar Championship in early March was impressive but the fact Paul Casey could swat him aside on the Sunday means we are in danger of being seduced by a fairytale.And still, excitement flows. “It is incredibly close,” the former world No\u0026nbsp1 David Duval said. “We’ve all questioned what is the top for him in this comeback. What can his body do? What can his new golf game do?”The Golf Channel analyst added: “Having had the opportunity to speak to him about it, we were all in a hurry to judge what was going on. I sat up here and said: ‘Let’s give him the starts, let’s give him the summer, let’s give him the year, let’s see if he can gain some of the freedom he needs.’“Well, it looked to me this week that he regained that freedom. I watched the body pass the club through the downswing, watched him maintain his spine angle through that process. He hit some monster tee shots, incredible iron shots and the freedom with which he did that we just hadn’t seen.“I still want to give him more events but what I saw this weekend makes me excited it could be incredibly close and that must make him excited. I hope he plays sooner rather than later. I hope he doesn’t go home and just hit golf balls. I want to see him play rounds under tournament conditions and expose himself exactly like he did this weekend. Because he did that and he performed.”To an extent, that is. From the position of making the Sawgrass cut by a stroke, Woods raced to eight under par after 12 third‑round holes. He was firmly in the tournament mix. From there he played a gettable closing stretch in plus one. In the final round another fast start – he was six under on the 13th tee – was offset by the playing of holes 14 to 18 in three over. It seems reasonable to infer that, when Woods tries to press for victory – and he has to, having not been the man to catch at any event on this comeback – shortcomings appear. The same happened at the Arnold Palmer, where Woods pulled a tee shot into a back garden, three holes from home.“He’ll win sometime soon enough,” said Jordan Spieth, who partnered Woods on Sunday. “He’s certainly playing well enough to do so. His game, if I compare it to other guys I’m playing with day to day who are winning tournaments, is right up there.”Woods begins this week having leapt to 80th in the world rankings, with a new name on top. Justin Thomas’s out-performing of Dustin Johnson at the Players means the US\u0026nbspPGA champion is the world No\u0026nbsp1 for the first time.“It’s not something where I just want to do it once,” Thomas said. “I want to do it for a really long time. I want to have it for a really long time because that means I’m playing better than everybody else for an extended period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/275b2f8fdbad5de34f52278426cbe0c53f1d784d/533_685_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a5eb90b1954828cd6c8f8bf6a32242","title":"behind scenes baftas 2018 in pictures","story":"Photographer Sarah Lee joins the stars backstage at the Royal Festival Hall, London, for the Virgin TV British Academy Television Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d8fe946c664cac2bb318dac3372c5627923006/0_91_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3a864ce6a9cbc7f6aeae2fef8d2ab02","title":"iraq elections who is moqtadr al sadr","story":"Shia preacher who opposed US-led invasion and led uprisings against troops has taken a surprise lead in Iraq’s parliamentary electionsThe influence of Moqtada al-Sadr, the 44-year-old Shia cleric whose Sairoon coalition has emerged as a leading player on Iraq’s political scene, is as much about his family name as his personality, theological learning or political acumen.Sadr first came to prominence as a preacher in the weeks after the US invasion of Iraq, in 2003, opposing the US-led occupation. His militant followers, including the Mahdi army, were responsible for attacks on US and British soldiers, fuelled violent sectarianism against Iraq’s Sunni Muslims, and dabbled in protection rackets and kidnapping.To enable this, his movement effectively exploited the network set up by his father, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr, who was assassinated in 1999 during the period of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship.In person, his rivals have confided to journalists, Moqtada al-Sadr is not regarded as particularly impressive, with the epithet “firebrand” acting as a cover for instability and the shortcomings in his clerical education.Increasingly, however, it is Sadr’s relationship with Tehran that has come to define his political identity. While his Mahdi army was once regarded as being heavily reliant on Iranian-supplied expertise, Sadr has now positioned himself as an opponent of Iranian influence – at least when his rivals such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani are involved.Like his father, who saw Sistani as an “Iranian” interloper, Sadr is an Iraqi Arab nationalist. The family has long seen themselves as representing a rival Iraqi seat of Shia learning and influence to Tehran. This has recently seen Sadr reach out to Saudi Arabia, reportedly to give reassurance that Iraq will not simply be another client of Iran.The latest reinvention of his image is as populist as ever. In 2015, he formed an alliance with the Iraqi Communist party and secular groups under an umbrella of security and corruption concerns, two issues that have long dogged day-to-day Iraqi life, and his constituency.Several parties, including those following Sadr’s leadership, have committed themselves to a vision of a non-sectarian and technocratic government. But the history of Iraq’s past decade and a half – and Sadr’s disruptive role in it – suggests that only time will tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe1c0e4e173f2ac7e3428b93d99e5ce2dcded5a/43_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4787b184c02ea8bacc20e987b0205e4e","title":"is your boss secretly or not so secretly watching you","story":"From microchip implants to wristband trackers and sensors that can detect fatigue and depression, new technology is enabling employers to watch staff in more and more intrusive ways. How worried should we be?Last year an American company microchipped dozens of its workers. In a “chip party” that made headlines around the world, employees lined up to have a device the size of a grain of rice implanted under the skin between their thumb and forefinger. At first, Todd Westby, the CEO of Three Square Market, thought only about five or six people – him and a couple of directors, some of the people who worked in the IT department – would volunteer. But of the 90 people who work at the headquarters, 72 are now chipped Westby has a chip in each hand. They can be used to open security doors, log on to computers and make payments at the company’s vending machines.Can he see it taking off at lots of other companies? “Not necessarily,” he says. Or at least not yet. It’s partly a generational thing, he believes. “You may never want to be chipped but if you’re a millennial, you have no problems. They think it’s cool.” There are other uses for it – two months ago, the company (whose core business is selling vending machines and kiosks) started chipping people with dementia in Puerto Rico. If someone wanders off and gets lost, police can scan the chip “and they will know all their medical information, what drugs they can and can’t have, they’ll know their identity.” So far, Three Square Market has chipped 100 people, but plans to do 10,000.The company has just launched a mobile phone app that pairs the chip with the phone’s GPS, enabling the implantee’s location to be tracked. Last week, it started using it with people released from prison on probation, as a replacement for ankle tags, which Westby describes as “intimidating and degrading”. Could he ever see the company using GPS to track its chipped employees? “No,” he says. “There’s no reason to.”Not all firms would agree. Tech companies are coming up with ever more bizarre and intrusive ways to monitor workforces. Last week the Times reported that some Chinese companies are using sensors in helmets and hats to scan workers’ brainwaves and detect fatigue, stress and even emotions such as anger. It added that one electrical company uses brainwave scans to decide how many breaks workers get, and for how long. The technology is used on high-speed train drivers to “detect fatigue and attention loss”. While this sort of technology may have legitimate safety applications – a similar project was carried out with Crossrail workers using wristbands that sensed fatigue – it’s not hard to see how it could creep into other areas.In February, it was reported that Amazon had been granted patents for a wristband that not only tracked workers’ locations in the warehouse as they “picked” items to be dispatched, but could “read” their hand movements, buzzing or emitting a pulse to alert them when they were reaching for the wrong item. In the filing, Amazon describes it as being able to “monitor performance of the placing of the incoming inventory item into the identified storage location by the inventory system worker”.There are tech companies selling products that can take regular screenshots of employees’ work, monitor keystrokes and web usage, and even photograph them at their desks using their computers’ webcams. Working from home offers no protection, as all this can be done remotely. Software can monitor social media usage, analyse language or be installed on employees’ phones to monitor encrypted apps such as WhatsApp. Employees can be fitted with badges that not only track their location, but also monitor their tone of voice, how often they speak in meetings and who they speak to and for how long.Employees have always been watched at work, and technology has always been used to do it. But where it was once a factory foreman with a stopwatch, or workers having to physically clock in and out, now “all of that physical stuff has gone into digital technology”, says André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School. “It captures things that you weren’t able to capture in the past, like how many keystrokes are people taking, what are they looking at on their screen while they’re at work, what kind of language are they using. And surveillance follows you outside the workplace now.”How much of this is legal? In the UK, employers are allowed to monitor which websites you look at while at work, says Philip Landau, a partner at Landau Law Solicitors who specialises in employment law. “However, the device they monitor must be partly or wholly provided by work. Employers must also give prior warning if they are going to monitor your online activity, and should make you aware of the relevant social media policy.” It is also legal to monitor keystrokes, though again employees must be told they will be watched. “In companies where this system is in place, it is not uncommon for employers to speak to employees if they feel that their number of keystrokes is low,” says Landau. “It is worth noting that a high number of keystrokes does not necessarily mean high levels of productivity and vice versa.”Employers could theoretically use your computer’s webcam to see when you’re at your desk but “there should be a justification for such monitoring, and you should be informed of it beforehand. You should also be informed what the pictures will be used for, and how they will be stored.” As for GPS tracking, “a company may track any vehicles that they supply to their staff. However, the data they collect must only be used for the management purposes of the company. Any GPS device is not allowed to be turned on if the employee is using the vehicle for personal reasons outside of work.”Amazon says its scanning devices “are common across the warehouse and logistics sector as well as in supermarkets, department stores and other businesses, and are designed to assist our people in performing their roles”, while the company “ensures all of its associates have easy access to toilet facilities, which are just a short walk from where they are working”. It adds: “Associates are allowed to use the toilet whenever needed. We do not monitor toilet breaks.”Some of Bloodworth’s colleagues, he says, were angry about the level of monitoring – “but it was more cynicism and resignation. Most of the people I met hadn’t been in the job very long or were looking for other jobs. Every job was temporary and it was a workforce completely in flux.” Has Bloodworth seen the future? Will we all be monitored like this by our bosses in years to come? Possibly, he says. “One of the things that has arisen in response to the book is that people say work is going to be automated anyway, or workers need to be more flexible, as if this is the way of the future and it’s inevitable, which I think is quite dangerous. Amazon can get away with this because of political choices and because the trade union movement is quite weak. I think other businesses will look at Amazon, see they have had success with this business model – and seek to replicate it.”For his book Working the Phones, Jamie Woodcock, a sociologist of work at the Oxford Internet Institute, spent six months working in a call centre. You get a sense of the monitoring, he says, “from the moment you walk in. You have TV screens that have everyone’s relative performance to each other displayed. Managers collect data on almost every single part of what you do. Every single phone call I ever made was digitally recorded and stored. In terms of monitoring, it’s like being able to call back every single thing somebody has made on an assembly line and retrospectively judge it for quality. We all make mistakes and we all have bad days, but this kind of monitoring can be made retrospectively to sack people and is used to give people a sense that they could lose their jobs at any moment.”Monitoring is built into many of the jobs that form the so-called “gig economy”. It’s not easy to object to the constant surveillance when you’re desperate for work. What has surprised Spicer is how willingly people in better-paid jobs have taken to it. “Prisoners in the past were forced to wear tracking bands but now we willingly put on step trackers or other kinds of tracking devices given to us by our employers, and in some cases we pay for the privilege.” Companies such as IBM, BP, Bank of America, Target and Barclays have offered their employees Fitbit activity trackers.It is part, Spicer says, of “this whole idea of wanting to improve or optimise yourself. A lot of technology is designed to not just feed back data about your performance to your boss, but also give it to you. I guess they’re also seen as cool or fashionable, so it’s not surprising they’re taken up so readily.”Spicer has watched the shift away from “monitoring something like emails to monitoring people’s bodies – the rise of bio-tracking basically. The monitoring of your vital signs, emotions, moods.” Of Three Square Market’s practice of chipping employees, he says: “You can imagine that slowly extending. You could imagine things like employers asking to have your DNA in the future, and other kinds of data.”Surveillance can have positive applications. It’s necessary (and legally required) in the financial industry to prevent insider trading. It could be used to prevent harassment and bullying, and to root out bias and discrimination. One interesting study last year monitored emails and productivity, and used sensors to track behaviour and interaction with management, and found that men and women behaved almost identically at work. The findings challenged the belief that the reason women are not promoted to senior levels is that they are less proactive or have fewer interactions with leaders, and simply need to “lean in”.Still, says, Woodcock, “we need to have a conversation in society about whether work should be somewhere that you’re surveilled”. That need is perhaps most urgent where low-paid, insecure jobs are concerned. “If you work in the gig economy, you have a smartphone,” Woodcock points out, and that smartphone can be used to track you. “I think because many of these workplaces don’t have traditional forms of organisation or trade unions, management are able to introduce these things with relatively little collective resistance.”The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is well aware of the issues of monitoring and data collection. James Farrar is the chair of its United Private Hire Drivers branch, and the Uber driver who won a legal battle against the company last year for drivers’ rights. “They do collect an awful lot of information,” he says. “One of the things they will report to you on a daily basis is how good your acceleration and braking has been. You get a rating. The question is: why are they collecting that information?” Uber also monitors “unusual movements” of the phone when someone is driving (implying it knows if someone is using their phone while at the wheel) and, of course, tracks cars and drivers by GPS.Not all surveillance is bad, says Farrar. In some ways, he would like more. He was assaulted by a passenger and is calling for CCTV in all vehicles, partly for the safety of drivers. “There is a role for surveillance technology,” he says. Ironically, when Farrar went for a meeting with Uber to discuss the assault, the company made him turn his phone off to prove he wasn’t recording it."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490342.1526309898!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fourteen top tips for choosing your college course","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRemember that third level is not like most schools, and the onus is on you to be self-motivated and self-aware. Photograph: iStockPicking a college course can feel like the biggest decision a student has ever made. At this point, many will have a clear idea of what they want to do, but others are still holding off until the end of June to make their final call. So what should they consider?Diarmuid O’Dowd (DOD) is a guidance counsellor at Moyle Park in Clondalkin. Anne Ryan (AR) is a career guidance counsellor at St Conleth’s College in Dublin 4 and she also offers private career guidance (AnneRyanCareers.ie). Fergal Scully (FS) is a guidance counsellor at Rathmines College. Bernadette Walsh (BW) is a guidance counsellor with CareersPortal.ie.1. Know thyself: Do a psychometric assessment, which measures skills, aptitudes, interests, values and personality traits. Once you have identified a shortlist of 10 courses that are right for you, construct a table next to each course and write down the Leaving Cert entry criteria to see if you have the necessary requirements. This can help you to figure out what college courses will be a good match for you. CareersPortal offers a self-assessment test. (AR, BW)2. Follow your heart: Don’t choose a course based on what people have told you, or on labour market trends. Ask yourself: what are your favourite subjects, hobbies and interests? What would you love to know more about? If you don’t choose a course which interests you it will make it difficult to motivate yourself and less likely to achieve your best results. Remember that third level is not like most schools, and the onus is on you to be self-motivated and self-aware. Can you see yourself being interested in these subjects? (DOD, FS)3. Dig deeper: Don’t judge a course by its title. Many students find themselves on courses that are completely different to how they imagined, based either on their impression of the course title or the flashy pictures in the prospectus. This often contributes to first-year dropouts. (FS)4. Research is key: Study every aspect of the programme. Research course content over the duration of the degree, looking at the modules covered in each course and identifying the ones which are more interesting or relevant to your career aspiration. Failure to do so may result in you discovering midway through first year that you have made the wrong choice. Changing courses or repeating first year can be stressful but also expensive so research and research well. These days it is simple to look up the third-level institutions’ web pages for a complete breakdown of each module and its learning outcomes. (AR, DOD)5. Visit the campus: You may have missed the open day, but there’s still time to visit the college you intend applying for (perhaps even after your Leaving Cert but before the CAO Change of Mind deadline). This can help you get a sense of the place you may be spending four or more years of your life in. It will help you decide things like: can I handle the commute? What are the facilities like? And do you like the ambience of the place. (FS)6. Don’t aim too low: Many students get caught up in the points race and assume that the course with the highest points is the best choice in that field. Points are often based on the demand for the course, but this doesn’t mean that a similar course in another institution won’t give you the same breath of knowledge and opportunities to excel within that area. (DOD)7. The finer details: Find out how each module is assessed. Is it exams, coursework, presentations or a combination of all three? Do you gain work experience? Can you pick up some broader skills like spreadsheets or word processing? Consider the award you will be receiving upon completing the course and find out if it is recognised in the field you hope to get into. Will you need further study to get a good job once the course is complete? Can you commit to a four-year degree, or might you prefer a shorter one-year course and getting a job as soon as possible? (AR, FS)8. Think broader: If you feel you won’t be offered a place on your preferred course in a certain university, maybe consider post-Leaving Certificate courses within the field. You can then decide whether or not this is the career path for you and progress on to the preferred course the following year. Apprenticeships combine learning in your place of work with learning in an education or training centre, giving the apprentice a chance to earn and learn. FetchCourses.ie includes a range of part and full-time courses from levels three to six, including the PLC options. (DOD)9. Think abroad: If you don’t get the points for a course in Ireland, you may still be eligible to study abroad. You can apply to study in Europe through Eunicas. com \u0026gtEunicasor in the UK through Ucas. com\u0026gtUcas. (BW)10. Extracurricular: Maybe you want to be part of the college sporting life or would like to gain some experience that is not part of your course curriculum. Many students get involved with new sports, hobbies or political activism for the first time in college. Being involved can really make it easier to make friends.Top recruiters are often more interested in what extracurricular activities applicants took part in during their studies. Getting involved in clubs and societies provides excellent opportunities to practice and display many of the soft skills – such as being able to communicate effectively, show initiative and be creative – that are highly sought. Be especially mindful of this if you live close to where you will study, because the temptation to head home between lectures and not get involved in college life could cost you an interview down the line. (FS, DOD)11. Learn from other people’s mistakes: Each year a new report is released highlighting the number of students who drop out of third-level courses, or don’t progress from first year. The main reasons given always include choosing the wrong course and not having done sufficient research on the course content. (BW)12. It’s not forever: Try to avoid thinking about this as a decision you must stick to for the rest of your life. Framing this decision in this way makes what should be an exciting time a daunting and debilitating one for many and it can become impossible to actually make a choice.Instead frame this decision as your best next step. Try to find something that you feel interested or comfortable in studying as this will make all the work needed that much easier. These days it is becoming more and more common to change into different career areas as you move on with your life and many will find themselves working in areas totally unrelated to their primary qualification.Many students having finished their degree will go on to do post-grad conversion courses or a short PLC course to gain more general employment skills to add on to their degree to get that job. Although this choice is an important one, it is definitely not a life or death decision especially now that careers are so much more flexible. (FS)13. It’s good to talk: Do speak to people about your possible choices. Speak to your guidance counsellor who can help you sift through all the options out there, point out any pitfalls and encourage you to go for it. Talk to people who work in your chosen field. The LinkedIn website can be a great help for finding people like this. If possible talk to someone who is teaching on the course who can explain exactly how it all works. (FS)14.

Photograph: Jane Powers Irish bumblebee populations recorded in 2017 were at the lowest since monitoring began six years ago, with marked losses in critical native species, according the latest monitoring figures.The declines are confirmed by the All-Ireland Bumblebee Monitoring Scheme co-ordinated by Dr Tomás Murray, senior ecologist at the National Bioersity Data Centre in Co Waterford.There are 21 species of bumblebee in Ireland, which are vital pollinators of crops and wild plants. The findings released on Tuesday are based on the past six years of monitoring across more than 100 sites focusing on eight of the most common bumblebee species.“Based on a 2006 ‘red list’ , we already knew that six of our rarer 21 bumblebee species are threatened with extinction from this island,” Dr Murray said. Bumblebees are larger than honey bees and do not cluster in hives.“These include the charismatic great yellow bumblebee now confined to the northwest and the shrill carder bee, with its distinctive buzz, now only found in isolated populations in the west of Ireland,” he noted.Of 98 Irish wild bee species, one-third are threatened with extinction, he confirmed. For the first time, these new findings provide an early-warning signal on how more common bumblebees are faring.The large carder bee is threatened across Europe and, despite Ireland having relatively widespread populations of this species, a 23 per cent decline in the numbers have been seen since 2012, Dr Murray said.A combination of habitat loss, intensification of agriculture, hunger due to a decline in wildflowers, disease, poisoning by pesticides, climate change and imported species has caused bee population decline in Ireland.The overall trend since 2012 is a year-on-year decline of 3.7 per cent leading a total loss of 14.2 per cent. “Given the variability around our estimate, we have to be cautious about not crying wolf, but it is telling that we are detecting moderate declines in widespread species after only six years,” Dr Murray said.The declines were discovered partly due to the efforts of 80 citizen scientist volunteers. They walk a fixed route of one or two kilometres once a month from March to October and count the number and type of each bumblebee they observe using a standardised methodology.“In 2017, we collectively walked 883km over 490 hours, and counted 12,969 bumblebees across 14 species, making this one of the first national citizen science schemes in the world that tracks changes in wild pollinator populations,” Dr Murray said.To address declines in pollinating insects, an All-Ireland Pollinator Plan (AIPP) was launched in 2015. Its implementation is co-ordinated by the National Bioersity Data Centre.Project officer Juanita Browne said it was undeniable that bees are declining. “But the good news is we know exactly what we need to do to help bees, and the actions needed are very doable and will show results almost immediately.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3494453.1526283150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses in border area anxious over brexit impact on jobs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcern over recruitment post-Brexit was one  the key findings of an initiative undertaken to help inform a new strategy for health care staff in Northern Ireland. Photograph:  Lynne CameronPA WireHealth care staff in Northern Ireland are concerned about the ability to retain and hire EU colleagues post-Brexit, according to a survey published Monday.Nurses and doctors who live across the Border but currently work in the region are “anxious” and want reassurance, the findings of a workforce engagement exercise found.The feedback was among the key findings of an initiative undertaken to help inform a new strategy for health care staff in Northern Ireland.The plan to modernise workplace policies and procedures is designed to accompany the ongoing programme of reform of health service delivery in Northern Ireland.The Workforce Strategy 2026: Delivering for Our People, which was launched on Monday, has a stated ambition to address challenges with supply, recruitment and retention of staff.In regard to Brexit, one of the strategy’s objectives is: “Take account of and plan for the workforce implications arising from the UK’s exit from the EU and the subsequent implications for the EUEEA (European Economic Area) and non-EUEEA workforce.“The Department of Health strategy’s launch came as it was confirmed how £15 million of a £100 million pot already allocated for health service transformation in 201819 will be spent.Around £5 million will be directed towards the nursing, midwifery and Allied Health Professional workforce.This will include funding for 74 additional pre-registration nursing places, and 25 additional midwifery places, meaning a total of 1,000 nursing and midwifery training places are being commissioned from universities in 201819 — a total the department said represents an all-time high in Northern Ireland.More than 122,000 people work in health and social care in Northern Ireland, including the public, private and voluntary sectors. Around £2.3 billion a year is spent employing those who work in the public sector.Key targets outlined in the 2026 strategy include:- Explore and establish non-salary incentive programmes as a means of recruiting andor retaining people andor dealing with pressures in less popular specialties and locations.- Set up and roll out a regional health and social care careers service targeted at the existing workforce, young people from the age of 14, and possible returners to service.- Develop and integrate new ways of working and jobs across health and social care, and fund sustainable training and development programmes that meet service needs.Northern Ireland department of health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said: “This strategy recognises that we need to meet the challenge of making the Northern Ireland health and social care sector an employer of choice, by ensuring that the service is fully staffed, well-trained, and that workers can balance their work around the other commitments in their lives.” - PA"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Council hopes move will prompt families to use financial supports and rent independentlyBoard restoration and management review to be part of plan to rebuild public confidence\u0026lsquoI know people get pregnant by rape, but there\u0026rsquos a lot of counselling out there for that\u0026rsquoFour career experts offer advice on what to consider when deciding on your courseEmail shows clinical director regretted any \u0026lsquoperceived lack of clarity\u0026rsquo in cancer reviewInterim HSE chief says top management not told of row between doctors and CervicalCheckTimeline for the remainder of the 2018 college application processOf 98 Irish wild bee species, one-third are threatened with extinction, monitors findIt\u0026rsquos time to review your CAO application so here\u0026rsquos how to get your course choice rightPublic perception of teachers in Ireland is quite different to many other countriesA law degree alone will not make you a barrister or solicitor but it does confer an advantageSarah McInerney writes about her journey from being a DCU undergrad unsure about her course choice to an award-winning journalistNot everyone who wants to work in health sciences chooses to become a doctorMore than just a degree: Opportunities abound in many branches of engineering and technology as creativity and critical skills are increasingly in demandHow to know if a science, technology, engineering and maths course is right for youCompleting a third-level degree isn\u0026rsquot the only way to launch a successful careerHere\u0026rsquos how to go about choosing the best course and the right college for youPeople to take to streets in Greystones and Dublin over CervicalCheck failings"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495145.1526328493!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck director expressed regret for any misunderstanding on false tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Colm Henry  said he regrets taking at face value Prof Gráinne  Flannelly’s assurances that women would be told of false smear test results,  and regrets assuming that “people were following through on what they told me they were doing”. File photograph: Dave MeehanThe The CervicalCheck screening programme’s clinical director last year “expressed regret for any misunderstanding” over its communication strategy around disclosing false smear tests, when she met doctors.In a previously undisclosed email sent to HSE officials in September 2017, Gráinne Flannelly said she had met CervicalCheck’s lead colposcopists after a year-long dispute between the programme and the doctors over who was responsible for informing patients about missed cancer warnings arising from a review of cases.The email was released to the Joint Oireachtas health committee after questioning from TDs and Senators about who within the HSE was aware of the failure to tell women with cancer about the false tests.Prof Flannelly stepped down from CervicalCheck at the end of last month after it emerged that scores of women with cervical cancer had not been informed about incorrect smear tests arising from clinical audits.In an email last September, she told Dr Colm Henry, then HSE national clinical adviser to acute hospitals, and Elaine Brown, a project manager in his office, that the cancer review process “has been evolving over the last number of years” and she had “endeavoured to provide support and communication to the colposcopy teams”.She noted that Dr Kevin Hickey, the gynaecologist who treated terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan, asked that the cancer audit be discussed at the meeting. Dr Hickey had pushed the programme for more than a year to tell the women about the incorrect smear tests.“We expressed regret for any misunderstanding and perceived lack of clarity in the process to date,” Prof Flannelly reported back to the HSE officials about the meeting.“The key areas identified for improvement relate to communication – both of the process itself and regarding the outcome and interpretation of any findings.”She said CervicalCheck was working on a “prospective process of notification and consent” and a new leaflet, entitled Reviewing your Screening History, would be given to women shortly after they are diagnosed with cancer.This would tell the women “of the process and record her wishes to be informed about any findings”, she said.“We have, following the meeting, taken on board that the programme should record the woman’s wishes, and where she wanted to be informed, would write directly to her advising her when her results are made available to her clinician.”The clinician would provide the results and contact details if the woman wanted further clarification from the programme where required, she said.Prof Flannelly added that she had also spoken to Prof Donal Brennan, a gynaecologist oncologist, about including the gynaecological community to get “a consensus agreement and further feedback”.“This should provide a way forward to reduce any such disharmony in the future,” she concluded.Since Ms Phelan’s High Court settlement exposed the scandal, a review by the HSE’s serious incident management team found that among 1,462 women diagnosed with cervical cancer since 2008, 209 women had received false negative tests and they had not been disclosed to 162 women.Dr Henry has said he regrets taking Prof Flannelly’s assurances that women would be told at face value and assuming that “people were following through on what they told me they were doing”.The email was released by the HSE to the Oireachtas health committee in recent days after Dr Henry was questioned about why he did not escalate the issue to more senior iniduals within the health service."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495045.1526320212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plans for one of ireland s biggest mosques get green light","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWarrenstown mosque: an architect’s view of the complex that An Bord Pleanála has approved for BlanchardstownPlans for one of the largest mosques in Ireland have been given the go-ahead by An Bord Pleanála in spite of local opposition.The planning-appeals board has said the Shuhada Foundation of Ireland can build a four-storey mosque, community centre and primary school on the site of Warrenstown House, a former HSE facility in Blanchardstown, in west Dublin.Dr Taufiq al-Sattar, a Dublin-based neurosurgeon, pledged to build the mosque in memory of his late wife, Shehnila Taufiq, who died along with their daughter Zainab (19) and sons Bilal (17) and Jamal (15) in an arson attack in Leicester, England, in September 2013. Its tapering steel minaret, from where Muslims are called to prayer, will be 29m (95ft) high, the equivalent of seven or eight storeys.The board approved the development after finding that it would not seriously harm local amenities or property or cause a traffic hazard.Fingal County Council approved the plan last year, but it was then appealed by Patrick Regan, a former local resident, on the grounds of noise pollution, traffic congestion and lack of public consultation. A number of other locals lodged observations and a petition they expressed concerns about the visual and aural impacts of minarets excessive scale, overdevelopment and unsustainable development lack of integration with the local community and creation of an exclusive community.The council told the appeals board that the minaret will not be visually obtrusive and that any potential noise disturbance will be controlled by planning conditions. It also said the Shuhada Foundation of Ireland has indicated that the school and community centre will be open to everyone.Plans for the development were first lodged in 2016. They were substantially revised and scaled down last year after the council raised concerns about the scale of the development.“The call to pray can often start as early as 5.30am and the last call to pray at 9pm, causing noise pollution, with up to 150 worshipers attending at any one time during normal day prayers, without the celebration of Ramadan and other social events.”The new mosque will be financed from Dr al-Sattar’s family fund, his life savings and donations from the Muslim community in Leicester. He also plans to raise funds from the medical community in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan."},{"url":null,"title":"barnier on brexit ireland has the full support of all european states","story":"  April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by June   April 30, 2018DUP leader Arlene Foster says Barnier does not understand unionist culture   April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator says preparations must be made for no agreement on visit to Border area   May 1, 2018EU\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiator presses British for rapid agreement as DUP raises temperature   May 1, 2018Varadkar and Barnier put further pressure on UK to suggest detailed border solutions   May 7, 2018Key allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreed "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495135.1526327947!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse structural reform to be considered by cabinet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: Fianna Fáil has criticised him for his absence throughout the CervicalCheck controversy. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe Cabinet will on Tuesday consider major reforms to the governance structure of the Health Service Executive in an attempt to restore public confidence in the organisation.Minister for Health Simon Harris will seek approval from colleagues to restore the HSE board and to conduct a review of the current management system within the body to assess if it is fit for purpose.The board will also be asked to develop an effective performance management and accountability system within the HSE.A spokeswoman for the Minister said he believes the current structure does not provide an adequate governance arrangement for the HSE and measures to strengthen the oversight and performance of the organisation are required.Under the proposed legislation to be considered by Cabinet, the board will be accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions.It will also be responsible for the appointment of a chief executive, who will be responsible to the board for the performance of his or her functions. As part of its first tasks, members will be asked to prioritise a full examination by the new director general of the current senior management in the HSE – structure, responsibilities, capacity, skills and experience.It will also oversee the development and implementation of an effective performance-management and accountability system in the HSE within a set time period. The spokeswoman for Mr Harris said: “This should include measuring performance on service delivery, financialbudgetary management and reform, including culture and behavioural change.”The last HSE board was abolished by Fine Gael in 2011 under reforms introduced by the then minister for health, James Reilly. However, the recent cross-party committee report, Sláintecare, called for its re-establishment.The Cabinet will also on Tuesday consider a proposed strategic “national centre” tasked with carrying out national level functions, and with new regional bodies accountable for implementing integrated care.The proposals follow weeks of controversy over the CervicalCheck controversy and the failure to inform women of the results of a clinical review into their cases.The Government has already committed to a package of financial measures for those women, and to the possibility of redress following the results of a scoping exercise into the issue.However, there have been increasing calls for accountability and in ensuring those who failed in their duties are held to account.The Oireachtas health committee and the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee will also hold meetings on the issue this week. Three memos on what the HSE was told in 2016 about the cancer audits which are now the subject of a non-statutory inquiry were sent to the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday. It is understood a number of other pieces of documentation have been identified within the Department of Health relating to the issue.However, political sources stressed neither Mr Harris nor Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were aware of any such evidence during their tenure in office.The party’s health spokesman Stephen Donnelly said there was “constant coverage” of the Taoiseach during Storm Ophelia “ standing with members of the Defence Forces and the gardaí” but claimed no such situation has happened with the HSE. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495097.1526324307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leavers prepare their brexit betrayal narrative","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg: his use of “cretinous”, along with Boris Johnson’s “crazy”, to describe Theresa May’s customs partnership ideas suggests the histrionics of ham actors. Photograph: Matt CardyGettySo nostalgic and moleskin-trousered by stereotype, Britain’s Eurosceptic right is actually mesmerised by technology. In the referendum campaign, Leavers espoused the power of digital communication to collapse geographic distance, and make India as viable an export market as France.Now, faced with the riddle of how to leave the customs union without compromising supply chains or peace along the Irish Border, they bank on unspecified inventions to finesse the problem over time.This vein of techno-optimism does not run through Brussels, where “maximum facilitation” has few supporters, or even London, where Theresa May, the prime minister, tries to sell colleagues on a simpler customs partnership with the EU. Such is the minutiae behind an intra-Conservative Party war fought in increasingly public view.The mystery is why, with a hardish Brexit so close, Leavers would choose to die in this particular ditch. The customs partnership would not prevent an independent British trade policy. Britain would have to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, but this seems a small nuisance next to the prize of exit. And if the technology really does emerge, partnership can be swapped for max fac later on.Yet Boris Johnson, whose survival as foreign secretary is a daily reproach to May’s judgment, calls her idea “crazy”. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP goes with “completely cretinous”. Ministers whom she has asked to war-game the policy will do so with clothes pegs on their noses and expressions of distaste.There is something forced, almost thespian, about their complaints. After all, their dream is near. Why imperil it? Leavers did not just win the referendum, but the interpretation of the result, too. Britain is leaving the customs union and the single market, despite the closeness of the vote and the ambiguity of its meaning. We have lived through the gradual normalisation of a type of exit that was held to be “hard” in the days after the referendum.May has been a gift to the Leavers. As a rookie prime minister, hemmed in by advisers who failed to last the course, it was she who drew the red lines that left little to negotiate with the EU. “Trust me,” she wrote in the Sunday Times last weekend, but they should trust her implicitly by now.Why, then, this struggle among Leavers to take yes for an answer? Perhaps it is sincere, and they read into the difference between max fac and customs partnership a significance that is worth delaying an exit deal for. But with various pressures against them – time, the House of Lords’ enthusiasm for the single market – a passionate Leaver would surely compromise at this stage.Which is why we must entertain a more cynical theory. A good number of Leavers do not want to be associated with the exit deal that Britain eventually strikes with the EU, whatever its content. To that end, they are inventing grievances. Disavowal of the agreement allows them to escape blame if economic life deteriorates after its implementation, or voters feel no compensating thrill of self-government. “If only we had left properly,” would serve as the Leavers’ defence against popular anger.The betrayal narrative writes itself. A cabinet resignation or two would help it along. Johnson’s behaviour is consistent with that of a man who wants to be fired. Having won the referendum as rebels, endorsement of the official deal would turn the Leavers into apologists for a new status quo overnight, with all its imperfections and disappointments. Not just MPs, but newspapers too, would have to explain away the non-materialisation of Shangri-La on British soil. Neither temperament nor experience equips them for life as pragmatic defenders of a flawed but liveable reality. They will do what they can to prevent the change in role.And if their vexatious complaints prevent any deal being agreed, then, for some of them at least, so much the better. A certain kind of Leaver has always loathed the idea of exit talks, as though European permission were needed, and hates even more the prospect of entanglement in budget payments, regulatory agencies and the like.If all this seems implausibly calculated, then remember what the alternative explanation is. You have to believe that people who have devoted their adult lives to the cause of EU exit would, on the brink of their dream’s orderly enactment, become immovable on the details of customs regimes that merited no mention before.I do not believe it. Even their language (“crazy”, “cretinous”) suggests the histrionics of a ham actor. Leavers demand everything from a Brexit deal except their names on the paper. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

But by abusing a legitimate internet site to create a false profile, he could appear online as a 12-year- old school girl. Sadly, through this study we saw a range of grooming scenarios that abusers employ.Charities called for tighter regulations of social media companies.Andy Burrows, NSPCC associate head of child safety online, said: It’s time for tech firms to finally be held accountable. Too many children are abused on social media platforms, and it is time for industry to take responsibility and do more to tackle abuse at its source.Meghan Markle facing \u0026#39difficult situation\u0026#39 as father \u0026#39decides not to attend wedding\u0026#39North Korea begins dismantling nuclear test site, according to satellite photosMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

He said this was a worrying development as health care workers are known as amplification factors for such outbreaks.The WHO said that $18 million (£13.25m) is needed for a three-month operation to fight the disease. It has released $2.6m from its own contingency fund, while the UK Department for International Development and the Wellcome Trust have donated £3 million..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}This is not a licensed product and there are a lot of complications with using an experimental vaccinePeter Salama, WHO deputy director-generalDr Salama confirmed that for the first time during an outbreak of the disease a vaccine will be rolled out – it was approved for use during a smaller outbreak of the disease in DRC last year but was not used.Trials of the vaccine in December 2016 showed that it provides a high level of protection against a strain of the deadly disease. However, Dr Salama stressed that this is an experimental vaccine.This is not a licensed product and there are a lot of complications with using an experimental vaccine which requires to be kept in the long term at between minus 60 and minus 80 degrees celsius. So this is not a simple logistical effort, he said.WHO is desperate to avoid a repeat of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed more than 11,000 people.The agency, which was accused of being slow to respond in 2014, is working with the Congolese ministry of health to gather and test samples, conduct contact tracing and improve data collection and management. They are conducting a retrospective analysis of the chain of transmission to better understand the outbreak.Are we prepared for the next Ebola-scale epidemic?The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba, a remote part of the country, two to three days travel from the capital.The World Food Programme has put in place an air-bridge between Kinshasa, Mbandaka, the provincial capital and affected areas, with flights six days a week to deliver supplies and personnel.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the affected area, Bikoro in the north west of the country, at the weekend and praised the Congolese government\u0027s efforts.Ebola is one of the world\u0027s most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal.It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for bushmeat.The virus is handed on through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. After an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.It is DRC\u0027s ninth known outbreak of the disease since 1976, when it was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Meghan Markle facing \u0026#39difficult situation\u0026#39 as father \u0026#39decides not to attend wedding\u0026#39North Korea begins dismantling nuclear test site, according to satellite photosMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

Here\u0027s all the latest news about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family including her father Thomas Markle Snr and mother Doria Ragland, famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales.

The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd.

The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.Wedding at Windsor CastleThe couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, will walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridThe royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle facing \u0026#39difficult situation\u0026#39 as father \u0026#39decides not to attend wedding\u0026#39North Korea begins dismantling nuclear test site, according to satellite photosMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world.

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle facing \u0026#39difficult situation\u0026#39 as father \u0026#39decides not to attend wedding\u0026#39North Korea begins dismantling nuclear test site, according to satellite photosMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding 2018: Full details and latest newsBritish rugby player dies and second taken ill during Sri Lanka tourChildren as young as three live-stream to online predators, report findsRebranded Scouts will teach young people how to do their best to get a jobTelling patients to \u0026#39fight\u0026#39 cancer puts them under pressure, says MacmillanPrison nurses are ending up in hospital because of levels of \u0026#39Spice\u0026#39 fumesCommercial pilot \u0026#39battered wife to death when she wouldn\u0026#39t lower asking price of home\u0026#39US First Lady Melania Trump has kidney surgery for \u0026#39benign\u0026#39 conditionStop calling nurses \u0026#39sister\u0026#39 and \u0026#39matron\u0026#39 - it\u0026#39s putting men off  Teenage criminals more likely to go straight if they have a sonWomen could \u0026#39pay the price\u0026#39 of botched attempts to tackle screening scandal Firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr takes shock lead in Iraq electionAt least 55 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in Gaza protests as US opens Jerusalem embassyComment: If the Irish Government obliges us to choose between the Republic and the Union, then we will choose the Union Prisoner shows off jewellery, TV and PlayStation as he brags of ‘comfortable’ cell in Instagram live video We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/14/TELEMMGLPICT000163183729_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMdh6xRjNIMbUEJJ9Tv0x6g1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"north korea begins dismantling nuclear test site according satellite","story":"This satellite image released and notated by Airbus Defence \u0026amp Space and 38 North on March 30, 2018, shows the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North KoreaNorth Korea has begun dismantling facilities at its nuclear test site, according to a satellite survey conducted by American researchers. Analysts at the 38 North website say commercial imagery taken last week reveals that several support buildings have been demolished, railroads have been removed and mining carts overturned.Pyongyang has promised to dismantle the Punggye-ri test site under the gaze of journalists between May 23 and 25.The underground facility has been the site of all six North Korean nuclear tests.The destruction of the site has been offered as an example of the secretive regime\u0027s commitment to disarming ahead of a historic meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un next month. Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump are due to meet on June 12 in SingaporeThe commitment was praised by Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, on Monday. This would be a preliminary step toward complete denuclearisation, he said during a meeting with his aides, according to his office.However, sceptics point out that part of the site is believed to have collapsed, rendering it unsafe, and that North Korean no longer needs a test site, having developed a nuclear arsenal.The analysis suggests that work has already begun on dismantling the site.Kim Jong-un has the USA and South Korea exactly where he wants themImagery from May 7 shows that two key buildings (one likely an engineering office building, the other a compressor building) near the portal has been razed along with a shed that might have housed instrumentation equipment and one small outbuilding, reads the analysis.The rail lines for the mining carts have all apparently been removed and the previously noted train of mining carts appears to have been tipped over andor disassembled on the spoil pile.At the same time, a number of new structures may be designed to provide access and vantage points for the world\u0027s press.However, no tunnel entrances at the test site appear to have been permanently closed yet.This may be because on May 12, the official Korean Central News Agency announced that the final dismantlement of the Punggye-ri nuclear test ground would be witnessed by foreign journalists and would involve the \u0027collapsing all of its tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances, and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts\u0027, the report concludes.Please review our commenting policyMeghan Markle facing \u0026#39difficult situation\u0026#39 as father \u0026#39decides not to attend wedding\u0026#39Meghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed.

Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

The new handset – which packed new internals into the small body of the iPhone 5 – proved immediately popular, and Apple is said to have been surprised by the scale of the interest in the new phone.Now Apple is rumoured to be updating the two-year-old handset. The sheer quantity of the rumours does appear to suggest that something is on the way – though it\u0027s not clear what exactly that might be.Apple finds technique that could revolutionise how iPhones are madeThe company might simply choose to upgrade the internals so that they are faster and more fresh, without making any major changes to the outside. That was suggested by usually reliable analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who said earlier this year that his sources in the supply chain didn\u0027t appear to be expecting a drastic overhaul that would bring new features like wireless charging or the iPhone 8\u0027s glass back.However, some rumours suggest a far more extreme change. Leaks that claim to have come from the Chinese supply chain have suggested that the company could be preparing an update to the iPhone SE that would make it more like an iPhone X – including that phone\u0027s edge-to-edge display and the trademark notch that cuts into it – though those rumours are far from confirmed.Many of the rumours suggest that the new phone could come sooner rather than later, and that it will launch long before the main updates to the iPhone arrive in September.If the phone does receive a significant upgrade, it is unlikely that the company would reveal it without an event at the same time. There will probably be only one event before the major iPhone reveal in the Autumn – Apple\u0027s Worldwide Developers Conference, where it tends not to reveal new hardware.But if only the insides receive an upgrade to make them faster, then it is possible Apple could release the new phone with a simple press release.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

Linda* emptied her refrigerator, packed some clothes, her toothbrush, toothpaste and an iron, and left the house she had lived in for 34 years – for good.“I closed the door, turned my back, started my car and left,” she says. “I had lived there since February 1977. A lot of things, carrying a lot of memories, remained behind that closed door.” The hardest room to leave was her personal library. “It is funny that one can miss the books as much as I do, it’s as if they were part of my blood.”In October 2017, I meet Linda, a regal-looking woman with glasses and silver hair. We sit in the lobby of a hotel in downtown Helsinki, a few blocks from the apartment she lives in today. When she first moved, she bought a bed, a TV and a broken sofa from the previous tenant. She didn’t bother to get any chairs – she didn’t think she’d be there long. It’s been more than six years. The problems with her old house started in 2008, when she began to get fevers and developed issues with her voice. A building company found high levels of mould in her basement. She says that, although she tried to get her house cleaned, the mould seeped its way into all her belongings. She began to feel so ill that she had no choice but to abandon her home. After leaving, her symptoms persisted and her health continued to deteriorate. She tells me she became highly sensitive to other buildings, minuscule levels of mould, and chemicals or smells. When she went to the doctor, she was told these multiple chemical sensitivities couldn’t be related to her mould exposure – she had moved, there was no way she could still be sick. She gave up. “I was so tired I really hoped the next fever would kill me. I didn’t try to find any help any more. In a way, life was over.”Linda has sick building syndrome, or SBS, a controversial condition with many definitions and symptoms and even more proposed explanations. A basic definition is that it’s an illness a person gets from a building they live or work in. Speculated causes have included dust, microbes, carpets, ventilation and, like in Linda’s story, mould. Other researchers have claimed there are psychological forces at play, that SBS is related to anxiety, dissatisfaction at home or work, or other mental conditions. Sick building syndrome was a common term in the 1980s and 1990s. It has since faded out of use in the US, where I live, but continues to be studied and discussed in Nordic countries like Denmark and Finland.Origami-inspired skyscraper designed for disaster zones wins contestI came to Helsinki to meet members of an online SBS community, including Linda. Another member of the group, Jesse*, a slim 17-year-old with dyed blonde hair, tells me that he and his mum also had to leave their home. “I was getting sick every winter and summer when the temperature dropped,” he says. “I got the flu, I got headaches, my legs hurt, my head hurt, rashes on my skin, everything like that.” They found mould growing in the walls of their house and had to desert their clothes, all their furniture. “Everything,” he says. Family photos were salvaged and wrapped in plastic. They are going to make photocopies of them through their coverings. Jesse says he often has reactions at school. Sometimes he has to do his classwork in the hallways, away from other students. His visits to the doctor didn’t yield any help. “Because it wasn’t any sort of flu or any kind of bacteria or virus, we were all right,” he says. The doctors told them there was nothing wrong.In 2013, Linda found a doctor who thought he could help, and through “nutritional therapy” she eventually felt well enough to rejoin the world. She doesn’t think her illness and sensitivity will ever go away, but within months of starting treatment, she managed to go on a skiing trip with her daughter.Others are not so lucky. Maria*, 40, says that doctors in Finland are too quick to label SBS as psychological. In 2012, she got sick from her office where she worked in child services. She would get stomach pains, infections, high blood pressure – all medical issues she had never had before. In 2014, mould was found in the building but, despite loving her work, she had already left the job. By 2015, she wasn’t able to go into other buildings too. But being diagnosed with SBS in Finland does not open up access to support.“When I got sick, there was no place for me to go,” says Maria. “I couldn’t get any money. No sick pay, nothing. No rehabilitation, no retraining in a new profession, no unemployment benefit. I was being left out without any rights at all, with nothing.”There must be a psychosocial element, some research claimed. How else to explain that women are more likely to have SBS than men? Or that employees’ wellbeing could be associated with floor plans and office arrangement, office noise or how much control they had over their environment? Hedge’s own work examined SBS questionnaire answers from thousands of workers in various buildings. “We didn’t find any evidence of an actual syndrome. In other words, no consistent pattern of all of the symptoms.” In the end, he says, they “don’t really know whether it’s the building or it’s the people”.Hedge has had a long career of tackling building-related health problems and says the “building or people” puzzle isn’t easy to solve. In one of his cases, people felt ill only in the mornings between 09.30 and 10.00. When the air was tested (later in the day), nothing unusual was detected. Hedge eventually found a cause that explained the odd timing: carbon monoxide from the morning’s arriving cars was rising into the office through elevator shafts.An office in Montreal with 2,000 employees was on the verge of evacuation because of a bad odour. Hedge says everyone was worried it was a “sick building” and that their health had been affected. He found only a couple of mouldy oranges left in the desk of an employee on vacation. Smelly, but not dangerous. “But the reaction,” he points out, “it was a genuine reaction. You smell something, you don’t know what it is. You’ve heard there is a problem and pretty quickly you can feel bad.” After SBS had peaked, Hedge says he started to hear about another disorder: multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). People who claim they have it say they can be intolerant to any chemicals or materials in any building. I ask Hedge to apply his standard line of inquiry: is it caused by the buildings or the people?“I have no doubt that they have a problem,” he says diplomatically. “The question is, how much is that problem related to their environment or how much is it related to what they think might be in the environment?” The bigger problem, Hedge says, is that people who suffer from SBS or MCS often get lost in the medical system. They’re shuttled between medical doctors who can’t find anything wrong with them physically and psychiatrists who say their symptoms are imagined. Neither offer treatment. People can end up homeless, broke and feeling cynical about doctors and therapists alike, just like it has played out in Finland.“Over time, these people will find each other,” he says. “And then when they find each other, it’s like the Flat Earth Society. They reinforce each other. These are people who are desperate for an explanation for what’s happening to them. And in the absence of that, all they have is their imagination.”On a frigid morning at a cafe in downtown Helsinki, Anna* orders a hot chocolate. She tells me there are thousands of people in Finland who are sick from indoor mould exposures, who have been told they are crazy, referred to psychiatrists, have lost their jobs, left vacant furnished houses and, in some cases, destroyed their homes. True to Hedge’s advisory, she also belongs to the group of people with SBS and MCS from indoor mould who meet in Helsinki every few months.Her own experience began when she started getting frequent coughs, colds and flu-like symptoms in the summer of 2014. At first, she attributed them to her grandchildren, whom she was babysitting on the weekends. You know kids, she tells me – they always want to “puss”, she says, puckering her lips and miming kisses in the air. But her health steadily got worse. She always felt tired, her voice would disappear and she would cough all the time.Anna is a medical doctor and worked in a hospital at the time. “We had occupational doctors, and I went and said, ‘Something strange is happening to me.’” She wondered whether her immunity had somehow been compromised? Was her thyroid damaged? Did she have HIV?Linda uses a blue light to sterilise her belongings“We took all the tests I suggested and everything was clear. I started to think about very unusual things. I am a doctor, but could not understand.” When she went on sick leave for a week, her voice returned. Back at the hospital, it disappeared again and the coughing returned. That’s when she started to think it was related to the building.Anna tells me that she had heard about mould illness before she got sick, but she didn’t consider that it was happening to her. Until, that is, her technicians found a large mushroom growing in the lab next to her office. Her boss told her that they would renovate, and that when she returned from sick leave she would work in a different office on a different floor, away from the lab. When she went back in January 2015, her symptoms started up again. Doctors told her there was no logical explanation. “They said that I am afraid,” she says. “That I was imagining. It was so offensive.”Her last day at work was in February 2015, when a technician pointed out how strange her breathing sounded. Anna says it was a wake-up call: “I tried with all my efforts,” she says. “I thought that I should overcome, I should stand it. And the technician said to me, ‘No, you are not breathing well.’ And then I looked at myself, and I thought, ‘This is really crazy, I will kill myself.’”Eventually, she found herself in the position of so many people with SBS. She wanted to work, she loved her profession – but how can you have a job without being able to go into a building? Instead, she started to research mould-related illness and its after-effects and to work out her rights.I ask her what she thinks about psychological treatment, which is often turned to in the absence of any confirmed physical cause. Even if their illness wasn’t caused by mental problems, couldn’t someone who has lost everything benefit from therapy? She is adamant in her answer: “Psychiatric therapy? No. They don’t need it. They need new apartments. A place to stay. A place where they can breathe. They are strong people, they have overcome such difficult situations. They don’t need this ‘blah blah blah’. They need real help, real support.” Linda left her former home after developing a mould-related illnessAnna doesn’t strike me as an imaginative hypochondriac. She is level-headed, forceful, clear and has a seemingly perfect memory. There is no doubt in my mind not to believe her, and the debate over mould illness and SBS seems ridiculous. They found a huge mushroom in her office, how could there be any dispute?I continued to think this about pretty much every mould sufferer I met: most had documentation to show me the proof of mould contamination found in their home or office. How could a real mould exposure be considered psychological? But I soon recognised that it wasn’t that initial exposure being contested. It was the continuation of symptoms – the cough and breathing problems that Anna had, even after the mushroom had been removed, the lab renovated and she relocated to a “clean” office. Those were the symptoms that were harder to explain and impossible, according to Anna, for doctors and insurance companies to accept were real and deserving of “real” help and support instead of psychiatric help.Anna says that one of the most upsetting parts of her illness was being disappointed by her own profession. “I was so perplexed because I am a medical doctor, I always wanted to help people,” she tells me. “I was taught I should believe what patients tell me about their illness, I should do my best. And when I was in the position of a patient, nobody really wanted to help me. Why is that?”Eventually, though, like others in her group, she found the one doctor who would believe her symptoms were real.Ville Valtonen, a bald 73-year-old in a pressed coat and a dark cap, waves me over to his car. We’re driving to Helsinki University Central Hospital, where he worked for more than four decades. His SBS history lesson is the same as Hedge’s: the energy crisis led to a change in building practices, and the patients followed. The first ones he saw came in the late 1980s. They would be previously healthy, usually early middle-aged people who had started getting repeated infections. The laboratory was refurbished but still Anna’s symptoms persistedValtonen’s career then was centred on the link between strokes and infection. Now, in his retirement, he is returning to the mystery of those early patients. He is one of the few doctors in Finland who is willing to give mould patients a diagnosis, which he calls Dampness and Mould Hypersensitivity Syndrome.Valtonen defines five stages of the disease. They’re based, he says, on the progression of the syndrome that he’s seen in the hundreds of people he’s treated. First, a history of exposure to mould in water-damaged buildings, then an increase in infections. Third comes SBS, and fourth, MCS. Finally, an enhanced scent sensitivity, meaning a person is extremely sensitive to the smell of moulds, “a hundred-fold more accurate than normal,” he says. In Valtonen’s model, SBS is just one factor of the overall illness. He says there is still hope for a mould-exposed patient with only SBS, because their symptoms will stay away if they avoid any source of mould or chemical that triggers them. “But if the patient has gone forward to this mould and chemical sensitivity, it is almost impossible to cure completely,” he says. “And if you have electromagnetic sensitivity, it’s hopeless.”Although he tells me that many of his patients have it, I’m sceptical of this symptom, as repeated studies have shown that participants cannot tell when they’re being exposed to electromagnetic fields. He says many of his mould patients can no longer use mobile phones. Some develop chronic fatigue syndrome, unable to walk even 10 metres others develop epileptic seizures, but show normal electrical activity in the brain when tested. That’s a lot of different symptoms, I venture, so what does he think is going on? Valtonen says he can’t e into researching the mechanism as deeply as he would like. “I’m 73 and I’m too old to get any grants and do anything, so I’m only going to see those patients I have now,” he tells me. His theory is that the illness involves an immunological reaction that combines with secondary infections. Insurance broker warns toxic mould could become the \u0027new asbestos\u0027Many of his SBS patients describe Valtonen as the doctor they were lucky to find. He was a turning point in their illness, a moment when they could finally get better, because he gave them a diagnosis. But as we talk, I’m struck by how he doesn’t really offer treatment – his advice is simply to avoid any and all triggering exposures. The most valuable thing he provides, I think, is his acceptance of the biological nature of their symptoms.“I can’t be a doctor who doesn’t believe, what is that?” he says as we leave the hospital. “In my 45-year clinical career I’ve very seldom, very seldom seen patients who lied to me.”But as I would soon find, it’s not always as simple as being lied to or told the truth. When I meet Kirsi Vaali, Merja Lindström and Mikko*, they excitedly tell me something that I want to believe: Mikko is a mould patient they have cured. Lindström is a homeopath and Vaali is a biomedical researcher at the University of Helsinki. Before researching mould, Vaali studied food allergies and chronic fatigue syndrome – she has an interest in diseases that others cast off as psychological, she says. She emphatically tells me that mould illness is actually related to mitochondrial damage, and that she has a candidate gene that could predict susceptibility.This is the moment when doubts begin to surface in my mind. It was easier to offer my belief, as Valtonen does, to the patients. Their stories weren’t focused so much on medicine or mechanism, but on life, and the ways it was taken from them when they started to feel sick. Now, faced with the “science” of this disease, I find my faith wavering. In 48 short hours, I’ve been told this illness is an innate immune system problem, an inflammation problem, an autoimmune disorder, a blood-brain barrier issue, an oxidative stress problem, and now mitochondrial damage and a genetic disorder? I have yet to see any data and I want details. Has Vaali taken blood samples from patients? Could they see or measure mitochondrial damage in people with SBS? What, I ask, is the connection between immune system function and mitochondria?Vaali and Mikko start laughing, and I worry I’ve asked a stupid question. In fact, I’ve asked a fundamental one that they have no idea how to answer. Vaali shrugs: “That question is impossible to answer.”In the course of our conversation, Vaali adds to a growing list of putative mechanisms and symptoms, telling me that women are more susceptible because of their hormones, because toxins go into fat stores and because of a lack of liver enzymes, and that mould patients have altered sleep rhythms. Instead of going into scientific detail on these topics, Vaali and Lindström mostly want to talk about how patients could be helped. Using Mikko as a case study, they tell me that through homeopathy and natural supplements, these people can be “rescued”. What are these miracle supplements? Vaali won’t tell me straight away, and neither will Lindström. I ask no less than four times over two hours, tolerating digressions and caveats that for each person it is a little different, or that I probably don’t have the same supplements abroad. At last, Vaali shows me Mikko’s regimen, made up of very basic vitamins and nutrients. Most are supplements that I also currently take. Vitamin B, iron, omega-3, curcumin (the active ingredient in turmeric) and a few blends of fatty lipids. Vaali also advises against eating gluten, and Lindström says only organic food is allowed. Cheese and other mouldy foods are bad, because those can be triggers. Wine is OK, but only organic wines with no additives. Litigation fear over toxic mould invading one in four UK homesI begin to have a gnawing feeling, one I’d suppressed when I heard that Valtonen makes patients better without doing much of anything, or that “nutritional therapy” had turned Linda’s life around. I haven’t yet doubted the illness or its symptoms, but its alleged treatment is stirring up suspicions. If SBS is purely a physiological disease, caused by something as serious as an immune disorder or mitochondrial damage, how can it be “rescued” with vitamin B?Lindström shows me her homeopathic pills that she takes for mould illness, which I look over with raised eyebrows. I try to keep an open mind, but I know that homeopathic medicines have such low concentrations of active ingredients they can’t possibly have any biological effect. I do think that healthy eating and lifestyle can help overall mental and physical health – and the treatment of chronic disease. What I question is their application as a fix-it for a specific pathology, especially one that’s unknown. We have a link between saturated fat and heart disease, but what is the link between gluten-free organic food and decreased sensitivity to chemicals? Biodynamic wine and electrical sensitivity? Homeopathic arsenic tablets and mycotoxins? Mikko senses my scepticism. He tells me he doesn’t believe in this stuff either. He’s a general practitioner and a child psychiatrist, and let the supplements sit in his closet for nine months before trying them. He rejected the homeopathic pills and affectionately calls Lindström a “witch doctor”. But he does believe that the supplements helped make him feel better.Mikko bought a new house in 2003, and his symptoms began in 2007. By the autumn, he was living in a campervan on the street. He says that when all his symptoms – itching, headache, nausea, throat and nose irritation, and eczema – hit at once, it was like “burning in a hell”. He suffered for five years before finding relief with Vaali and Lindström’s treatment. He says it took one or two months to improve at the same time, the ventilation in his house was being cleaned. He attributes his recovery to the combination of both. Mikko has been in psychotherapy for years. He tells me he knows himself very well and is sure this isn’t a psychological disease. “I think different kinds of psychotherapy can help people to stand the hell that they are living,” he says. “But not to cure them from the biological disease that they have.”Later, I get Linda’s list of nutritional therapies. She too is being “cured” with supplements, and I want to compare her regimen. It’s a lot of the same: fatty acids, high doses of B and other vitamins, curcumin, etc. It’s broken down into parts of the day: before breakfast, breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, lunch, after lunch, before dinner… and at least three or four pills each time. Whenever you finish taking your last supplement, you begin gearing up to take the next one.Part of me feels glad she has a solution that works for her, and the same with Mikko. But it also feels like they’re being chained to something else. Whereas the sickness used to control their lives, now it’s the diagnosis and the cure.I take a break for lunch, appreciating the brisk air on my face. As I walk, I think about how much my attitude has changed since I arrived. I’m upset because I feel close to the mould sufferers for reasons I haven’t disclosed to them. That feeling of knowing you’re sick, but being told by doctors that you’re not – I know that feeling.Throughout my life, I’ve regularly gone to the doctor for unexplained symptoms. I’ve gotten scans and painful tests for which, over and over, the results would come back normal. I’ve had three doctors, in different specialities, try to prescribe me antidepressants for physical symptoms. Recently, I struggled with idiopathic dysphagia, meaning I was having trouble swallowing – even choking at times – but there was no reasonable explanation. I had been diagnosed a few years earlier with laryngopharyngeal reflux, a version of acid reflux some gastroenterologists aren’t sure exists because there often isn’t any measurable acid in the throat. I have fallen into natural remedy black holes too, hoping to find the magical supplement that cures me. I go beyond what Vaali and Lindström offer, though never to homeopathy. I add super greens powders to my smoothies, powdered liquorice to help with digestion, digestive enzymes and L-glutamine to help my stomach lining.As a science writer and the child of scientists, I justify a lot of my actions by consulting research. Deep down though, I know that my relationship with my body and the way it feels comes both from how it “really” feels and how I’ve been taught to react to it. In my childhood home, food was labelled for when it would go bad and each person had a hand towel just for them, to control the spread of germs. Going to the doctor, requesting unusual medical tests, searching for something in the body gone wrong – this was the environment I grew up in, a kind of “sick building” in itself. People can end up homeless, broke and feeling cynical about doctors and therapistsA specialist who observed my swallowing, and saw nothing wrong, warned me that if I kept treating my body as if my swallowing was broken, I could, in fact, break it. By not using the muscles in my throat, I could create a weakness and then have a real problem. “No need to create a real issue out of nothing,” she said.Her advice frightened me into eating solid foods again. But I remember thinking: isn’t my issue already “real”?I have always looked at my body as a potential battleground Anna and the others in Helsinki have not. Something clearly happened to them. Could the very real exposure to a toxic mould have pushed them into seeing their body through new eyes? Shown them that this is all it takes for your health to be taken away? That it could be something invisible, growing in the walls, in the air you breathe? It’s such a violation, perhaps other walls start to break down. The wall between emotions and body, thoughts and physical feeling. Perhaps that wall was never there, but they thought it was – and that exposure, that violation, broke the illusion.Risto Vataja, head of the neuropsychiatric clinic at Helsinki University Central Hospital, believes SBS in Finland to be a contagion of ideas rather than a disease. He tells me SBS is so well-known here that it’s common to believe that houses are dangerous, schools and hospitals are dangerous, that any place you go, your health is at risk. He says the media plays a big role in disseminating fear, and he scrutinises my intentions with this story. Later, he will email me to say, “Good luck with your article, and don’t make people sick, you journalists have the power...” Still, he hesitates to call SBS a psychiatric or psychosomatic disorder, instead preferring the word “functional”, which is also used to describe conditions like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. “Functional means that they are not psychiatric,” he emphasises. “Psychology is probably involved in the mechanism, and we know that in patients with functional disorders. So, they are real symptoms, but we just cannot identify any good physiological explanation.”Vataja is an advocate for psychological help, like cognitive behavioural therapy. That advocacy probably explains the trouble he’s had reaching patient groups, who tend to reject any psychological component. “We agree that we are not able to help them enough,” he says. “We agree that the healthcare system has not thought enough about these problems, and that we don’t have enough research. We have lots of common things that we agree on and we should try to build on those.”Vataja thinks that telling patients to avoid all buildings that make them feel sick only furthers the illness. “Some colleagues of mine can increase the burden of these patients,” he says. I had seen Ville Valtonen’s unwavering belief as a source of relief for his patients, but was he at the same time perpetuating the disease? Did they have mould illness before they went to see him, or only after? Valtonen remains convinced that avoidance is the best available treatment – although he accepts that controlled studies to prove this theory would be beneficial.I turn to Juha Pekkanen, head of the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki and a researcher at the National Institute for Health and Welfare. He tells me that, according to studies they’ve done comparing European countries, Nordic countries should be less prone to dampness and mould. There’s less humidity and very dry air during their cold winters. There might be a slight chance of more exposure because people spend more time inside, or that dry winter air could add irritation to respiratory systems, but there’s no solid reason why there is more mould illness – except for the fact that people know about it. “We know worry causes symptoms and causes disease,” he says, “so we want to build trust and reduce worry.”He is one of the researchers assigned to set up a governmental programme to provide aid to people with SBS. How? “It’s not obvious yet, but of course we need to help these people. There are people who are living in tents and bad situations. Anybody within a bad situation we should somehow extend a hand and try to help them.”It was encouraging to hear someone affiliated with the government saying this, because some patients had suggested there was little care for their outcomes. Pekkanen says that’s not true, but he thinks a focus on mechanism and diagnosis has clouded the issue. He hopes that whatever they design to help people will be more practical. Jesse and his mother left their home for a new apartment block when he started getting sick“I think we should try to get them back to the society, and not build separate communities somewhere in the woods with no electricity, no chemicals, no nothing. There’s no end to that,” he says. “That’s not going to help these people. If you just focus on making it cleaner and cleaner and cleaner, it stops never.”He doesn’t think they’re “playing sick” though. Why would you pretend to have an illness that is not approved for compensation? He thinks that once a person encounters an issue with indoor air, they get real irritation and respiratory symptoms. But once they have these symptoms, some people begin to expect something more, something more sinister. “For many people, it is likely due to some kind of nocebo effect. You’ve heard about the nocebo effect?” he asks me. “Basically, expectation. I don’t like this categorisation between physical and psychological, I think it’s been shown we’re one whole, our psyche and self are intertwined, inseparable.”The placebo effect pervades much of the history of medicine, and explains why in the past some remedies, surgeries and treatments appeared to work despite our now knowing they are inert. More recently, attention has turned to nocebo, the reverse effect. The two aspects of nocebo effects are negative expectations and conditioning. Negative expectations are when you assume an outcome will be bad and then perceive it to be so. This has been shown in studies where patients experience side-effects to sham treatments only because they were warned about those side-effects in advance. Conditioning can occur when you associate a certain activity, place, drug (or anything) with a feeling or symptom. Studies of positive conditioning have shown that patients can find relief from allergic rhinitis symptoms through conditioning with a flavoured drink, can have conditioned immunosuppression and conditioned growth hormone increase. It’s been speculated that some of the negative side-effects of chemotherapy can be attributed to negative conditioning. But calling something placebo or nocebo doesn’t mean it’s not real or physical. “Neuroscientific investigations from the last 15 years have shown that the placebo effect is in fact a real biological phenomenon due to the psychosocial context of the patient and the therapy,” authors of a 2013 review wrote. Nocebo effects are associated with changes in several brain areas, neurotransmitters and hormones.Keith Petrie, a professor of health psychology at the University of Auckland, has studied how nocebo effects can stem from the idea that the environment, medicine, architecture and technological advances in food are causes of poor health. In 2001, the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had announced they would be spraying insecticide to eradicate an invasive moth species, the painted apple moth. Petrie surveyed 292 residents about their current health symptoms and any health worries they had, then followed up after spraying. Higher levels of worry were associated with a higher number of symptoms attributed to the spray programme.“If people believe that they’re sensitive about a particular stimulus and then they’re exposed to it, then they report symptoms,” he says.When I ask him how Finland’s mould patients could possibly feel better from natural supplements, or from seeing a doctor who doesn’t give them medicine, Petrie says: “The good thing about treatment, any kind of treatment, is it shifts your perceptions. You go to somebody with a problem and say you’ve got the flu or a cold – you’re focused on how terrible you feel and your headache and your cough. You go to see someone and they give you a treatment and the way you’re viewing your illness shifts immediately. Instead of looking at how sick you are, you look for signs of recovery.” But it can go the other way too. Research has shown that placebo and nocebo effects can also be triggered by interactions with a doctor, even if your doctor tries to empathise with you. A 2015 review concluded that “reassuring patients that there is nothing physically wrong with them, when they are in a great deal of pain, can leave them feeling misunderstood and delegitimised”. Another study looked at doctor-patient interactions in patients who complained of symptoms but had no diagnosis. They were assigned to two groups, one where the doctor said they didn’t know what was wrong and another where the patient was given a firm diagnosis and reassured they would be better in a few days. After two weeks, 64 per cent of the patients in the group with a diagnosis reported getting better while only 39 per cent of those in the group without did. If there’s one thing common to all the mould patients, it’s being dismissed by doctors and being told their symptoms were unexplained. After reading these findings, I wonder if their true toxic exposure was to this uncertainty. It seems it can be harmful to your health to hear that what’s taking place in your body is a mystery. There are researchers who haven’t given up on this mystery and are hunting for a biological explanation. Thomas Dantoft, at the Centre for Clinical Research and Prevention in Denmark, is looking for biomarkers: differences somewhere in the body between people with MCS or other functional disorders and those without. He is also project coordinator for the Danish study of Functional Disorders (DanFunD), the first large, coordinated epidemiological study focusing exclusively on functional disorders.The cohort includes 9,656 men and women who were surveyed for fibromyalgia, whiplash-associated disorder, MCS, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and bodily distress syndrome. The study includes interviews and personality tests and collects plasma, DNA, urine, gut bacteria and more. Participants will be followed until 2020 and hopefully will provide some much-needed epidemiological information. Because it isn’t just the sufferers who have numerous conflicting hypotheses about the cause of their illness. I spent weeks reading different papers – ning decades of research – on biological causes of MCS. Several implicated the immune system, validating one of the theories I was told in Helsinki, but other work contradicted them. One of Valtonen’s stages of the disease is an increased sense of smell, but Dantoft says that his and other studies have shown that isn’t true. What about psychological factors? Dantoft says he isn’t sure either way. He says functional disorder patients live in dire conditions and it would be incredible if they didn’t get depressed. “All studies working with MCS and other sorts of disorders, whatever you want to call them, show that there is higher risk of anxiety and depression,” he says. “But we don’t really know what comes first, and that also doesn’t mean that they are making it up. Maybe people who are at higher risk of getting depressed also have a higher risk of getting MCS? But that doesn’t mean you can cure MCS by treating the depression, necessarily.”Dantoft thinks mental help could be offered not as a fix, but as a stand-in until more is known. “The big issue is that the patients and the clinicians aren’t being honest with each other,” he says. “Because the fact is we have absolutely no efficient treatment to offer these people.” Is the building sick, or are the people? I’m frustrated that I’m no closer to answering this question. I also feel guilt. Guilt that my reporting led me to question the experiences of the people I met in Helsinki, and for my nagging intuition that there is more going on than just mould exposure. Faced with the option of building or people, real or not real, I still can’t settle on one.When I ask Linus Andersson, a cognitive scientist at Umeå University in Sweden, he tells me why: it’s been the wrong question all along. He is collaborating with chemist Anna-Sara Claeson, and together they are doing the most comprehensive work that I could find on mould and toxin exposure in people who report that they have MCS. “I have felt pushed towards choosing whether or not I would follow psychological or medicalbiological lines of work,” he says. “But I came to the conclusion that it’s not even a real question. Or, there is an answer: it is always both.”For the past decade, Claeson and Andersson have been exposing people to different compounds and measuring any effects on blood flow using brain scans, inflammatory markers in the mucus from the upper airways and, recently, gene expression. Over Skype, they show me their exposure chamber, which looks a bit like a phone booth – only with no phone. In this tiny room is where most of their experiments take place. In an experiment published in 2015, they exposed participants with MCS (along with controls) to a compound called n-butanol, which they chose because people find it hard to decide whether it smells good or bad. For the first ten minutes there was nothing, then the n-butanol increased to a set level and plateaued. MCS participants, compared with controls, reported greater perceived odour intensities, more unpleasantness from the exposure, and increasing symptoms over time. The MCS group also reported more symptoms in the 10 minutes before they were exposed to anything. Andersson thinks this could be associated with nocebo-like expectations, but he also says that to him, expectations producing symptoms doesn’t mean that an illness is imagined.He tells me that people often have allergic reactions without a “real” exposure. In a 2007 study on food allergies, it was found that children could have reactions to placebos: more than one in 10 of the food challenges produced false positives. The symptoms were real: intense bodily responses like rashes, hives, diarrhoea and vomiting. Claeson and Andersson say this shows that the body is very good at predicting and defending itself from what it thinks will be damaging, which should make researchers cautious when interpreting nocebo and placebo results. In a 2017 paper, Claeson and Andersson describe exposing people with chemical intolerance (along with controls) to the chemical acrolein. Chemicals are detected in the upper airways by the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. The olfactory nerves are involved in smell, while the trigeminal nerves can evoke irritation or pain. They found that people with MCS reported greater irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, even when acrolein’s smell was masked. Because their aggravated symptoms didn’t require them to be smelling the chemical, Andersson and Claeson think perhaps people with MCS could have altered trigeminal reactivity, and will continue to look into that.No study they’ve done yet has offered the mechanism of MCS on a silver platter. Andersson says their goal is to find some kind of exposure that separates an MCS sufferer from a control. It doesn’t matter what it is if they can find it, he thinks it would lead to a better understanding of how and why these patients respond differently. What does he think about natural supplements or homeopathy “curing” MCS? “My answer to this question is basically the same as for that pertaining to explanatory theories – the claims need to be backed up with data,” he replies. “When, or if, homeopathic treatment regimens would actually fulfil scientific criteria, then I would not be against it per se. I have yet to see such studies, however. So, my question for everyone who makes theories and statements of how MCS can be treated is – where’s the structured data?”I asked Vaali and Lindström so many times to tell me about their supplements, and their lack of data pushed me away from their cause rather than towards it. But while Andersson and Claeson’s mindset and careful research are refreshing, it’s all still exploratory. Unlike Vaali and Lindström, their work doesn’t offer an easy solution someone can take today, right now. It doesn’t allow patients to move from the world of the sick to the world of the well. What Andersson and Claeson can provide now is relief from all those dichotomies: building or person sick or well organic or made up. I can’t tell you if SBS or MCS or mould illness is “real”, but I know now that our definition of real is flawed. The split between psychological and physical is flawed the idea that psychological isn’t real is flawed the notion that psychological is not inherently physiological is flawed. These isions are what led to this health crisis in Finland, not abnormal levels of mould. I went to Helsinki and was asked to believe. And I do. I believe that Anna’s symptoms are real. I believe that Maria was mistreated by doctors and by her employers, that Jesse and his mother felt alone, and that Linda was neglected by her housing company. I believe that they should be helped. But I have one belief that I worry disqualifies all the others. I also believe that, after an initial mould exposure has been resolved, understanding the continuation of any symptoms must include a consideration of the mind. It pains me to know that the people I interviewed in Helsinki, who so graciously shared their stories, time and vulnerability with me, will probably be displeased with my version of their story. This is not the exposé they were hoping for, not a condemnation of the Finnish government nor the uncovering of a plot to keep mould patients quiet to avoid the costs of rebuilding and social security. People at the hospitals and National Institute for Health and Welfare sounded seriously concerned and are implementing programmes like the one Pekkanen mentioned to try to bridge the gap between officials and patient groups who feel wronged. Claeson says that while researchers can’t yet give people a cure, they can do their best to keep looking, keep trying to help. That in itself is a kind of belief. It’s not exactly like Valtonen’s, but it’s belief all the same.“I think it’s important to take the people that are suffering, to take them seriously,” she says. “I think that if we do research, that means that it’s a ‘real’ problem. And I think that is something that we can offer.”* Some names have been changed in this article.This piece was first published on Mosaic by Wellcome and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.A 2006 study used data from the Whitehall II study to explore the role of the work environment in explaining sick building syndrome.In an article published in 2017, Ville Valtonen describes how sick building syndrome is one of five clinical criteria he uses to diagnose Dampness and Mould Hypersensitivity Syndrome.Research published in 1987 looked at the effects of GPs using a “positive” or “non-positive” manner with their patients.This 2007 paper describes children’s allergic reactions to placebo.The Danish study of Functional Disorders was described in a 2017 paper.Some of Linus Andersson and Anna-Sara Claeson’s research can be found in papers from the study using n-butanol and the study using acroleinor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In fact, the strangeness of our own universe might better be explained by an undiscovered natural law, they said.The idea of the multiverse comes about because in physics terms, our universe is very lucky to exist at all.Scientists launch huge survey to find alien lifeCurrent theories predict there should be much more dark energy inside of our own universe than there is. That is a problem because adding more dark energy would lead it to expand so quickly that any matter would be diluted before it could form the stars or planets that we need to live.In response to that, some have suggested that we might in fact be living inside of a multiverse. There are in fact lots of different universes – many of which will have more dark energy and so could not host life – and we simply live inside one that worked out in the right way.But the new study suggests that we might have been overstating how lucky we are. It might actually be possible for stars and planets to form even if there is much more dark energy.“We asked ourselves how much dark energy can there be before life is impossible?” said Pascal Elahi, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia. ”Our simulations showed that the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy has hardly any impact on the birth of stars, and hence places for life to arise. Even increasing dark energy many hundreds of times might not be enough to make a dead universe.”It is still true that our universe could be very special. But it does not need to be quite so special, the researchers showed.“The multiverse was previously thought to explain the observed value of dark energy as a lottery – we have a lucky ticket and live in the Universe that forms beautiful galaxies which permit life as we know it,” said Luke Barnes, a John Templeton research fellow at Western Sydney University.“Our work shows that our ticket seems a little too lucky, so to speak. It’s more special than it needs to be for life. This is a problem for the multiverse a puzzle remains.”That puzzling fact might suggest that the multiverse theory is not true in the first place. The study does not rule out the idea but does suggest that the small amount of dark energy in our universe would be better explained by a law of nature that we do not yet know about.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Negotiations on the future with the UK have no started yet. We have had first exploratory discussions.”Ms May had tried to steady nerves about her approach with an article on Sunday, in which she asked the British public to “trust me” on Brexit.Her supporters hoped it would draw a line under public spats on customs. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt even issued a “belt up” message to foreign secretary Boris Johnson after he called the “partnership” model – thought to be favoured by the PM – “crazy” last week.Jeremy Hunt: Brexit debates should happen in private“What we need to do is, as she said, come out of the customs union in such a way as to enable us to have frictionless trade with no hard border in Northern Ireland and to do unhindered, unimpeded free trade deals with the rest of the world. We think that is possible, she thinks that is possible, so that is the way forward.”Theresa May wants our ‘trust’ over Brexit. It isn’t going to happenThe “customs partnership” plan would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf at ports and airports, passing on a share of the money to Brussels – then if the UK sets different tariffs from the EU, traders would claim refunds from HMRC for goods that stay in Britain.Olly Robbins, Ms May’s Europe adviser, regards the partnership as a means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, while keeping the UK out of the European customs union. Close aides of Ms May have also called it “intellectually perfect”.But Downing Street has been privately warned that the customs partnership proposal could collapse the government, with the Brexit-backing European Research Group having organised a critical report backed by 60 MPs.The group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called the proposal “cretinous” and “deeply unsatisfactory”, and argued that it would “not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The other option, a “streamlined arrangement”, is viewed more favourably by Brexiteers in both the cabinet and on the back benches.It is known as “maximum facilitation”, or “max fac”, and would see the UK outside any customs union, but with some controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Backers say a “trusted trader” scheme and remote monitoring of the border would limit physical infrastructure.But it would still essentially mean a hard border on the island of Ireland. Critics claim this would break the Good Friday Agreement, risking peace in Northern Ireland.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The trio are warning that Britain is being “held to ransom” by hardline Tories hell-bent on a hard Brexit, in the starkest evidence yet that party allegiances are breaking down as battle rages over departure from the EU.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Miliband dismissed chatter about a new centrist party, saying his campaign was pushing for “cross-party working, not for creating a new party”.Bitter cabinet splits made it a “national crisis”, he warned, adding: “The UK has no negotiating position on the fundamental issues that face the country as it contemplates its post-Brexit relationship with the European Union.”Britain to ‘lose influence’ in global security operations after BrexitMay faces deadlock over Brexit customs rules as both options rubbishedMay urges public to ‘trust me’ to deliver Brexit amid cabinet rowsEU set to push for six-month extension to Brexit transition periodNurses from EU face annual £600 fee for own NHS costs after BrexitHe predicted an “enormous sigh of relief in Europe” if Britain stayed in the single market, because the EU “don’t want a weakened Britain, because they think it will weaken Europe”.The “Norway option” was now “on the table”, after that country’s prime minister made clear it would welcome the UK staying in the EEA.Mr Miliband, who runs a UN charity in New York, said he was also seeing at close quarters how the US, under Donald Trump, was turning away from Europe. “We have to take that into account,” he said.And he rejected Brexiteer protests that revolts in parliament weakened Britain’s negotiating hand, arguing: “What’s more destructive for a government position than having no position?”The three prominent politicians are calling on MPs to stand up to “the hardest of Brexits”, which they characterise as “a fantasy island” of “economic pain” and diminished standing.“Over the coming months, MPs will have the chance to table amendments to bills – and vote for those amendments – which can prevent the country from suffering the long-term damage that a hard Brexit will cause,” they wrote at the weekend.“The pro-Brexit press will angrily protest, but what is the role of MPs if not to improve and protect the lives of their constituents?”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Parts of the building were still smouldering and the floors of the cinema hall had caved in in places, another emergency official said.The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported the fissures opened just east of the Puna Geothermal Venture energy conversion plant, where steam and hot liquid are brought up through underground wells to feed a turbine generator to produce electricity.Plant workers removed 50,000 gallons (189,265 litres) of a flammable gas stored at the site as a precaution. Geologists have warned that Kilauea\u0027s summit could have an explosive steam eruption that would hurl huge rocks and ash miles into the sky. Most of the lava outbreaks have occurred in and around the Leilani Estates neighbourhood, where molten rock has burst through the ground, destroying more than two dozen homes and resulting in evacuation orders for nearly 2,000 people. Agencies contributed to this report or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died. Often the water they are given falls short of the large quantities they drink in the wild, and many die of severe intestinal blockages. Campaigners staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London, coinciding with prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Britain, pleading for abuses to be policed.They said lucrative insurance claims provide incentives for owners to neglect their animals.Colourful processions can mask animal suffering (Getty)But the New Indian Express was concerned about the effect on tourism of the publicity about the elephants’ plight, saying the protest outside the High Commission in London added injury to insult.“For the Kerala Tourism Department, it seems it is a case of one step forward, two steps back, while it is trying to brand and market the state as a paradise for holidaymakers,” the Express website said.“State tourism director P Bala Kiran said this is a very serious issue and it will have long-lasting impact on the tourism sector of the state if not addressed properly.”The Kerala Tourism Department has decided to make films of elephant care and majestic festivals featuring the culture and tradition of the state to counter the bad publicity, the paper reported.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen.

And Mr Friedman, visiting the site, tweeted: “Eternally grateful to President Trump for his courage and vision.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Pass muster with flying colours                REVEALED: This is the reason why bullfinches mate for life But since 2000 they have been increasing nationally according to the Breeding Bird Survey conducted annually by the BTO, RSPB and Joint Nature Conservation Committee.And the 11,000 volunteer members of the BTO\u0026rsquos Garden BirdWatch scheme, who send in weekly records of sightings, have confirmed the upward trend.Last month (April) bullfinches were recorded in 19 per cent of the GBW gardens, nearly double the 20 year average.Over the whole of last year there was a 16 per cent increase in the percentage of gardens reporting them.But the BTO said there is no clear explanation for their apparent recovery.Bullfinches eat fleshy fruits and flower buds and sometimes take sunflower seeds from feeders.In spring, when the male makes his \u0026ldquopew call, they also feed their young insects.Their decline has been blamed on intensive farming and a reduction in food availabilityAnd next month is when the annual peak in sightings occurs as adults bring their newly fledged young to feeders.GBW volunteers also recorded a 15 per cent rise last year in sightings of song thrushes - another bird which has suffered long term declines.Claire Boothby, the BTO GBW Development Officer, said \u0026ldquo2017 saw record reports of Bullfinches from October-December and this year we are on track for the highest-ever records. Will this be the case? We need your help to find out.Kate Risely, Garden BirdWatch Organiser at the British Trust for Ornithology, said \u0026ldquoNot only was 2017 a great year to see Bullfinches, we also recorded more Pied Wagtails (32 per cent more gardens per week), Song Thrushes (+15 per cent), Goldcrests (+11 per cent), and Goldfinches (+5 per cent) in gardens than we did in 2016."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/Risso-959658.jpg","title":"dolphins wash ashore on british beach","story":"HM Coastguard GorlestonRisso DolphinThe Zoological Society of London has retrieved\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspdolphin carcasses from near Great\u0026nbspYarmouth over the weekend and will be\u0026nbspconducting\u0026nbsppost mortems to discover how the creatures\u0026nbsphad died.Rumours have emerged\u0026nbspthat the dolphins may have\u0026nbspfallen\u0026nbspvictim to a great white shark attack because they\u0026nbspwere scarred, but skin\u0026nbspgouges are\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspcommon sign on these type of marine mammals\u0026nbspbecause of injuries they receive\u0026nbspeating their\u0026nbspfavourite food, squid.What concerns conservationists is the way the\u0026nbspdolphins\u0026nbspwere found in a southern stretch of\u0026nbspthe North Sea when, by rights, they\u0026nbspshould\u0026nbspbe\u0026nbsphunting squid and octopus around the western\u0026nbspScottish and Irish coastlines.

profits are squeezed in towns and cities because of supermarket competition.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are huge variations in the amount of profits taken at the pump, largely depending on how far you go from the centre of an area.Perth had one of the widest gaps in Scotland\u0026ldquoWhere there are supermarkets, prices are driven down considerably, but in more rural areas, prices are higher and the amount of profit shoots up.\u0026ldquoMotorway service stations exploit drivers even further, literally highway robbery.Service stations say their fuel prices are higher because many are open around the clock and run more services than normal forecourts, while also paying high rents.Garages in remote areas argue fuel is more expensive there because of greater transport and supply costs.Motorists\u0026rsquo groups suggest that mass avoidance of the most expensive pumps will help drive prices down.Last week, the RAC warned that the pockets of drivers would be hit by a \u0026ldquotoxic combination of rising oil prices through the weak pound, production curbing from OPEC and geopolitical instability."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/secondary/car-1342514.jpg","title":"jensen cv8 car owned sean connery sale 135k","story":"SCOTThe CV8 is on sale for

So will the glamorous couple get rained on as they drive away in a horse-drawn carriage? Heres the latest...Detailed forecasts usually only cover the next five days.The weather - especially in Britain - is too unpredictable to look further ahead with any confidence.However, the Met Office has given out their forecast for the big day and the crowds camping out near Windsor Castle may be in luck as rain showers are predicted to give way to a warm spell just in time.The Met Offices UK outlook for May 19 says:  The latest weather forecast for Windsor on Saturday is looking ideal for the wedding, and almost perfect for the crowds gathering to watch the carriage go past.At this early stage, there is some uncertainty about the amount of cloud around but we can expect at least some warm sunny spells.Early temperature forecasts suggest that the day will start off rather cool, with an early morning temperature of around 6 Celsius, so anyone who arrives early to get a good place in the crowd will need to wear something warm.The maximum temperature in Windsor that day will be around 20 Celsius, compared to an average for the time of year of around 17 Celsius. At this time of year, the sun is very strong so anyone planning to sit outside all day would do well to wear some sunscreen.We are fairly confident that there will be no rain to spoil the proceedings with only a very small chance of a shower.The accuracy of the temperature and cloud forecast will improve as the week goes on so keep an eye on the latest information on this webpage, on our Twitter feed, and on our mobile app.Another forecaster, AccuWeather, predicts normal spring conditions on May 19 and says rain is unlikely.Typical highs for the time of year are around 18.5C with an average of 0.05 inch of rain.Meteorologist Tyler Roys says there will not be another heatwave like the one in April and predicts a comfortable temperature of around 17C.He added: “The most important thing is not necessarily temperature, but actually rather if there is any rain or not.”The MeteoGroup, which provides weather information for the BBC, predicts a 17 percent change of rain on the day with windspeeds up to 10mph.Overall though the day is expected to have sunny intervals and breezy.May 19 has been mostly dry in previous years and only once in the last two decades was there more than a tenth of an inch of rain (in 2003).Mr Roys said there is a very low chance of storms but showers cant be ruled out.He added: “The threat for wind is low to nonexistent.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which they are.The Sun is all for more grammar ­places so long as a generous proportion are guaranteed for children from low-income families — as they will be.We back more choice, smaller classes and higher standards. So does the nation.DONALD Trump has been given the usual kicking over Iran — but he may be right.Barack Obama’s dodgy deal freed the mullahs to spend billions spreading war and terrorism throughout Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.Trump aims to halt that and punish the extremist regime. Who knows . . . maybe Iran’s people will finally revolt.Trump’s aggression and rash tweets have surprising upsides. He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise. A rabidly left-wing UN “racism inspector” sent to “find out” if Britain is more racist since the Brexit vote has decided — wait for it — we ARE!Her bogus “report” is a load of pre-meditated and vacuous bilge designed to bash ­Britain and the Leave vote.It must have irritated Tendayi Achiume to have to leave her home in the Californian sunshine for the charade of a 12-day UK tour amassing “evidence”.Here’s an idea, though.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie.

Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She needs to solve the housing crisis.The number of people renting in their 30s, 40s, and 50s has nearly doubled in the past decade. Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies. They are aspirational hard-workers, who want a home to call their own. Many are the people Mrs May once called those “Just About Managing”.House reforms are vital for the future of the Tory Party. Next to Brexit, it is the most important thing for them to fix.Mrs May once said it was her mission to solve the housing crisis.Well, PM, what happened?SEXISM has no place in the workplace.Yet almost a third of women say they have been ordered to dress provocatively by bosses, against their wishes.The Government has issued guidelines to stamp this out.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will help you feel calm and happy.“Read a book, play on your computer, Xbox, PlayStation, play a board game, watch some films whatever you enjoy doing most, try and find some time to do that before Monday.The weather for the weekend looks good. Get yourself outside for a game of football, cricket or whatever sport your enjoy.“Go for a walk or run, climb a tree anything that will get your heart pumping a little.“Remember that exercise lowers your stress levels, makes you feel happy and more alert.He went on to put the SATs results into perspective and told they children he wanted them to do as well as they could.Mr Frost continued: The results you get will not change how wonderful you are, how much family and friends love you or what you are capable of in the future.”Ending the letter he said: Remember that SATs do not test the following qualities: compassion, creativity, happiness, love, generosity, confidence, kindness, faith, bravery and many more things that are far more important in life than long division and adverbial phrases.Parents said that they had sat down with their children and read the letter out together with their children in an age when most communication with schools was online.A similar positive thinking exercise was carried out at the Lakeside Primary School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.Lakeside’s reassuring letter, send out earlier last week, read: Next week you will sit your SATs tests for maths, reading, spelling, grammar and punctuation. We know how hard you have worked, but there is something very important you must know….The SATs tests do not assess all of what makes each of you exceptional and unique. The people who create these tests and score them do not know each of you the way that we do and certainly not in the way your families do.They do not know that some of you speak two languages or that you love to draw and paint. They have not seen your natural talent for acting or playing the ukulele. They do not know that you have entered story writing competitions or street dance competitions.They do not know that you have represented our school at Young Voices. They do not know that your friends can count on you to be there for them, that your laughter can brighten the darkest day or that your face turns red when you feel shy.They do not know that you participate in the school football team, the school netball team or the school cross country team.They do not know that you are obsessed with Harry Potter or Michael Rosen or flossing. They do not know that you wonder about your future, or sometimes help your brother or sister.They do not know that you are kind, trustworthy and thoughtful and that every day you try to be your very best.The outcomes you will get from these tests will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything. There are many ways of being smart. You are smart! So while you are preparing for the tests and in the midst of it all, remember that there is no way to test all of the amazing and awesome things that make you, YOU!This weekend please rest, sleep and believe, because you CAN!”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15888359obj-js4095873.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dr vaishnavy laxman decapitated baby mum childbirth","story":"A medical tribunal heard Dr Vaishnavy Laxman continued with a bungled delivery despite her colleagues warning of this baby is going to die.The 41-year-old, a consultant gynaecologist at Dundee Hospital at the time, pulled on the breeched babys legs until the head was detached and stuck in the mums womb, the hearing was told.Two other doctors then had to remove the infants head before it was sewed back onto his body so his mother could hold him and say goodbye.Dr Shmaila Siddiki told the hearing: I was so shocked at what was happening. I just said it’s dead, this baby is going to die.I had no confirmation of this as I wasn’t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby’s heartbeat had dropped.I saw the baby’s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.”The tragic death happened on March 16, 2014, after the womans waters had broken early.It is alleged Dr Laxman should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section at the hospital in Dundee, as the baby was in a breech position.The hearing previously saw another doctor break down in tears as she recounted having to remove the babys head from his mothers uterus, saying: (It) is the most horrific experience anybody could have and it has haunted me so much.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: “If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery.We were set up for a C-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated.I was under the impression we were going to do a C-section and this caused us a delay - I didn’t know what she was planning.After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn’t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.She added: Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down - this was not what I was expecting.I was speaking to another doctor who said how is she going to do it - how is she going to deliver the head.She told the hearing the attempt to pull the baby out last for about 15-20 minutes.Dr Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby.Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a fragile baby like the infant who died would suffer a lot more damage if pulled or twisted.The tribunal had previously heard from the mother, known as Patient A, who said she had been assured she would be given a C-section in the event of a breech birth.Speaking to the distraught mother Dr Laxmans lawyer Gerard Boyle QC told her: “Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.The hearing continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000276124302.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cliveden house meghan markle doria ragland stay night before royal wedding","story":"The US actress will be joined by her mum Doria Ragland at the sprawling country estate - where rooms can cost up to £1,500 a night - before the big day at St Georges Chapel at Windsor.Meanwhile, Prince Harry will stay at Cowarth Park with his older brother and best man, Prince William.The five-star Cliveden House will play host to Meghan for her last night before officially joining the royal family, with the 17th century mansion just 20 minutes from the chapel where the royal wedding will be held this Saturday.The mansion was built in 1666 by the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, as a gift to his mistress, later becoming a luxurious award-winning hotel.The National Trusts Cliveden Estate even offers up the aptly named Prince of Wales suite and is set on 376 acres of National Trust grounds, offering up stunning views of its grounds.The hotel appears proud of its rich history of luxury and powerful guests, describing how it has hosted powerful personalities, debaucherous parties and scandalous affairs for more than 350 years.The hotel even hosted the 1961 summer party where John Profumo met Christine Keeler - with the affair almost destroying Harold Macmillans Toy government.Photographs reveal the splendour of the hotel - with the luxurious rooms including king-sized beds surrounded with plush cushions and sofas.It also offers up an elegant French Dining room for its guests.Cowarth Park, where Harry will stay, is just as luxurious, offering the prince a relaxing oasis before the wedding of the year.The iconic hotel is marketed as the secret hideaway amongst rolling fields and ancient woodland.Photographs show off the 18th century country houses glamorous facilities, with its interiors rebuilt in 2008 to become a hotel.It is the only hotel in the UK that has its own polo grounds - a sport that Prince Harry is keen on.It is also where he and Meghan Markle kissed after a polo game last year.It was also the scene of his smooch with Queen Victoria actress Jenna Coleman, 32, after polo three years ago.Harry, 33, will have a mini stag night with brother and best man William, 35, also staying at the 18th century country house.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents.

Web-based services like Netflix and BBC iPlayer are the norm for younger people, but a switch would leave the elderly and people in rural areas without their favourite shows, the Social Mobility Foundation said. The BBC is only obliged to provide broadcast programming until 2027, when its current charter runs out. The report said: “Given the current rate at which consumption is shifting, we forecast the next charter period will see at least the start of the BBC’s move to online-only distribution of content.” But almost 40% of households with a single adult over 65 have no internet access, according to the Office for National Statistics.  The SMF said any switch-off of TV signals should only happen after extensive consultations and an improvement in broadband availability. SMF economist Scott Corfe said: “Many people rely on conventional broadcast TV signals and any move to switch them off should only be done slowly, carefully and when people are happy with it. New technology can make life better and more fun, but it needs to be something people want, not something imposed on them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"smiling mps remember tessa jowells","story":"NewsSmiling MPs remember Tessa Jowell\u0027s firm view on sex at the Olympics in affectionate Commons tributesPoliticians set aside their differences as they remembered the popular ex-Cabinet Minister after she died aged 70 from cancer\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor19:02, 14 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMPs smiled and laughed gently tonight as they shared their memories of “remarkable” Tessa Jowell after her death from a brain tumour. Politicians from across the parliamentary divide set aside their differences as they remembered the popular ex-Cabinet Minister, who died on the weekend aged 70. Theresa May led Commons tributes to the former Labour Culture Secretary, who played a key role in bringing the 2012 Olympics to London. MPs chuckled as the Prime Minister hailed Baroness Jowell’s sense of humour, adding: “For many years after London won that Olympic bid, the screensaver on her phone was a photo of her and David Beckham after the announcement, hugging. “As she said, you can be a feminist, but still be susceptible to a David Beckham moment.” Labour former frontbencher Yvette Cooper told MPs: “I can’t help keeping remembering a meeting before the London Olympics where she briefed us in some detail, with great frankness, on her plans to distribute condoms throughout the Olympic Village.  “She said to us, ‘There are going to be all of these athletes with their beautiful bodies and when they’ve finished their races they’re going to have a lot of sex, and we have a responsibility to keep them safe’. “With a twinkle in her eye, that was Tessa - completely down-to-earth, completely practical, had no qualms, no squeamishness about all aspects of people’s lives. “That was also what made her so remarkable.”  Labour MP Peter Kyle told of Baroness Jowell’s meeting with then PM Tony Blair over the Games.  The Hove MP said: “At the end of the meeting she turned informally to him and said, ‘Do you want to be the Prime Minister that had the Olympics within your grasp and chose to turn away?’ “That for me was Tessa because she had learned to weaponise the male ego and woe betide any big beast that stood between her and one of her political objectives.”  Labour backbencher Bary Sheerman said: “She brought fun into his place. “Sometimes we’re a bit dreary in these chambers - if Tessa walked in or was in the room it was a feeling of a bit of joy coming through the door.”  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn remembered a “warm and compassionate person”.   SNP MP Pete Wishart branded her “one of the great parliamentarians of the past 30 years”, saying she was “determined, feisty but always personable and charming”.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hailed her “unique” and “inspiring” gift for “bringing people together and breaking down barriers”. Mr Hunt, a former Culture Secretary, admitted he had the “terrifying responsibility” of Baroness Jowell’s Olympics dream come true.  “Faced with Tessa, I never dared put a foot wrong,” he said. Earlier, the peer’s daughter, Jess Mills, revealed her mum’s last moments were “incredibly peaceful” time, surrounded by her family. “It is the greatest honour of my life to be her daughter. The way that she was until the last moment was just so courageous and brave,” Ms Mills told the BBC. “Just the day before she had her haemorrhage, her and dad were just walking down the beloved lane that we have outside our house. “She was in the most wonderful spirits, smiling and laughing with dad and just having the most special time. We were with her every single moment. “We didn’t let her go for the whole of the last couple of days that she was very, very, very ill. “We literally laid with her, next to her, kissing her, holding her, telling her how much we loved her and it was the honour of our lives to be her family. “It was an incredibly peaceful time. Until the last moment she was the magnificent person, mother that we all know and just adore.” Dame Tessa Jowell, who has died of cancer aged 70, enjoyed a political career spanning almost 50 years that began soon before Labour entered its wilderness years. Born in London in 1947, she was brought up in Aberdeen, where her father worked at the medical school, before returning to the capital to train as a social worker. She reputedly stood as a Camden councillor in 1970 assuming she\u0027d lose - only to win and then chair the social services committee aged 25. The political bug bit her and she stood in marginal Ilford North in 1978 and 1979. But like many Labour hopefuls, she lost to a wave of support for Margaret Thatcher. It was another 13 years before she finally won the Dulwich seat in 1992, holding it for 23 years. She was one of the 101 female MPs - dubbed the \u0027Blair Babes\u0027 in less self-aware times - who coasted into Parliament on Tony Blair\u0027s 1997 landslide. And Dame Tessa was the firmest Blair ally you could ask for. She once said she\u0027d jump under a bus for the ex-PM, and held dinners with other leading female allies including Margaret Hodge and Harriet Harman.   Rewarded for her talent and loyalty, Dame Tessa had a string of frontbench jobs in health, women\u0027s rights before joining the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2001. It was that role that would make her. She tirelessly championed London\u0027s bid to host the Olympic games - and won it in 2005 in the face of Civil Service and Cabinet scepticism. The victory was tinged with tragedy. A day later, four men with rucksacks killed 52 people in the 7/7 London terror attacks. And later, the great recession would strike. In 2008, as the Olympics cost billions while thousands lost their jobs, Dame Tessa said: Had we known what we know now, would we have bid for the Olympics? Almost certainly not. Dame Tessa lost her Cabinet post in Gordon Brown\u0027s 2007 reshuffle, but remained Olympic minister and oversaw every stage of the games, from initial bid to competition. Ed Miliband, who was Labour leader during the games, said at the time she had left an enormous legacy and that the country owed her a debt of gratitude. Dame Tessa also served as employment minister and minister for women, and remained on Mr Miliband\u0027s frontbench in opposition before stepping down from the Commons in 2015. She was made Dame Tessa in the 2012 Birthday Honours for political and charitable services, partly for her Olympics work.   And she was a sure bet for a peerage - being made Baroness Jowell of Brixton after her retirement as an MP in 2015. She later stood to be Labour\u0027s candidate for mayor of London in 2016 but, with party feeling swinging away from the politics of Tony Blair, she lost the nomination to Sadiq Khan. Her career was not without controversy. Early on, she was forced to defend the exemption of Formula One at the time from a ban on tobacco ads. Later, as Culture Secretary, she met controversy over plans for flexible drinking hours and for Britain\u0027s first super-casino. But by far the most well-known controversy was her high-profile split from her lawyer husband David Mills in 2006. Dame Tessa admitted being unaware he had paid off part of their mortgage with \u0026pound350,000 at the centre of a bribery case involving former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Mr Mills was charged along with Mr Berlusconi with corruption in Milan and was convicted in his absence in February 2009, before being acquitted by the Italian Supreme Court under Italy\u0027s statute of limitations a year later.   The couple, who married in 1979 after Dame Tessa split from her first husband Sir Roger Jowell, parted after it was said to be damaging Dame Tessa\u0027s career, but they were later reconciled. Mr Mills accompanied her, along with their children Jess and Matthew, to Buckingham Palace when she was invested with her damehood in January 2013. The speed of her late physical decline was dramatic. On May 24 last year she had two seizures in a taxi as she made her way to a talk in east London. Two days later she was told she was suffering from a rare type of brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). She devoted her last months to an emotional campaign for more cancer treatments to be available through the NHS, including meeting PM Theresa May who called her an inspiration. And she was trying treatments herself, wearing a \u0026pound240,000 electronic skull cap. In February her daughter, Jess Mills, said she was seriously optimistic. Dame Tessa\u0027s final legacy will be her emotional January 2018 speech in the Lords in which she called for more wide-ranging and better-funded cancer care. She received a standing ovation as she told peers: In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close. I hope this debate will give hope to other cancer patients like me. So that we can live well with cancer, not just be dying of it."},{"url":null,"title":"us embassy in jerusalem opened","story":"NewsUS embassy in Jerusalem opened amid protests in which dozens of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forcesDonald Trump, who broke with other nations by moving the US HQ from Tel Aviv, made a speech via video in which he said the UK was committed to peace\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent17:23, 14 MAY 2018Updated17:26, 14 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIsraeli troops have killed dozens of Palestinian taking part in protests on the Gaza/Israel border as the US opened its embassy in Jerusalem. Donald Trump\u0027s decision to move the embassy makes the US the first nation in the world to have their HQ in the disputed city, a move which has sparked anger across the Middle East. At the opening ceremony Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provocatively praised Israeli soldiers and called Jerusalem, which the eternal, undivided capital of Israel.  This is particularly incendiary because, although Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its united capital, and its annexation of East Jerusalem effectively put the entire city under de-facto Israeli control, Palestinian leaders see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Israeli forces have killed at least 52 Palestinians along the Gaza border, health officials said, while some 900 Palestinians were wounded, about 450 of them by live bullets.  It is the highest Palestinian death toll in a single day since the 2014 Gaza war. Tens of thousands streamed to the coastal enclave\u0027s land border on Monday, some approaching the Israeli fence - a line Israeli leaders said Palestinians would not be allowed to breach. Clouds of black smoke from tyres set alight by demonstrators rose in the air.  The Palestine Liberation Organization called a general strike across the West Bank and Gaza in response to the deaths.  The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said that PLO Executive Committee member Wasel Abu Yousef announced a complete strike across the Palestinian Territories to mourn the martyrdom of those killed in Gaza on Monday. At the embassy inauguration ceremony, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump for having the courage to keep your promises. What a glorious day for Israel, Netanyahu said in a speech. We are in Jerusalem and we are here to stay. Trump, who broke with other nations by moving the embassy from Tel Aviv, made a speech via video from 5,000 miles away in the White House.  In an address he said: Congratulations it\u0027s been a long time coming.  He continued: Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every sovereign nature to determine it\u0027s own capital.  Mr Trump said: The United States remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement, Trump said. The United States will always be a great friend of Israel and a partner in the cause of freedom and peace. Trump said that the US had “failed to acknowledge the obvious” for many years, adding that “today, we follow through on this recognition.” He also said he was “extending a hand of friendship to Israel, the Palestinians and to all of their neighbors.”  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in lockstep with Trump over fulfilling a long-standing U.S. promise to move the embassy to the holy city and over Washington\u0027s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal last week, echoed the sentiment. What a moving day for the people of Israel and the State of Israel, Netanyahu said. He paid tribute to our brave soldiers who are protecting the borders of Israel today. and said that it was a great day for peace  A peace built on lies will crash on the rocks   The capital of the Jewish people, the capital of the Jewish state.  He thanked the US President saying: President Trump by recognising history you have made history.  Ivanka Trump unveiled the US seal on the consulate in Jerusalem which has been extended to make the new embassy.   Jared Kushner, the US envoy to the Middle East , told the invited guests: When President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it, Kushner said at the embassy\u0027s opening ceremony.  Today also demonstrates American leadership. By moving our embassy to Jerusalem, we have shown the world once again that the United States can be trusted, he said. We stand with our friends and our allies, and above all else, we\u0027ve shown that the United States of America will do what\u0027s right, he said.  Despite the US President staying away, there is a massive security operation in place amid fears of a terror attack. More than 100,000 Palestinians are expected to demonstrate inside Gaza.

A poll of almost 3,000 workers revealed almost half have made a bad first impression after having a terrible or humiliating start to a new job. Others arrived to find they were completely over-dressed, spilled tea everywhere, got lost en-route to the office and said something inappropriate because they were nervous. But 95 per cent feel it’s important to make a good first impression on others when starting a new job, with 82 per cent believing they’re more likely to make a positive impact on their first day if they know they’ve got their clothing spot on.  The study was commissioned by 4imprint, as part of its ‘First Impressions’ campaign, having recently released a new range of corporate clothing to help UK organisations and their employees create a strong and lasting impression. A spokesperson for 4imprint, said: “Starting a new job can be intimidating for a variety of reasons. “From not knowing who you’ll be working with, not being 100 per cent sure how to get to your new workplace and worries over what to wear can make for a nerve-wracking first day.  “Our study found the importance of what you wear to work can make you feel as comfortable as possible on a first day and help create a great first impression.” Turning up wildly over or even under-dressed was among the mistakes new workers do on a first day, with more than seven in 10 wishing they had a uniform for work, in a bid to make their first day – and consequently first impressions – easier to manage. Other first-day nightmares to appear in the top 30 list include finding there was no allocated desk or computer to work at and being late due to nasty traffic. Having a wardrobe malfunction and accidentally sending a sensitive email as a ‘staff all’ also feature in the list.  Meanwhile, one in three British workers have been introduced to someone on day one at work, then immediately forgotten their name. One fifth have also been so nervous they’ve ended up blurting out something inappropriate or stupid - leading to quizzical looks from colleagues. Others have accidently damaged company property, been over-friendly and had to ask how to turn the computer on. But researchers found those who excelled on their first day put it down to being fully prepared and sufficiently knowledgeable about the company.

Robbie Goldsmith was so lonely during his nearly 30-year career that he hurled thousands of bottles containing notes into the ocean. Using a variety of containers that floated, the 73-year-old says he would chuck as many as 12 messages into the water every week. Each one explained where the bottle had come from, and asked the finder to let Robbie know when and where it had been found. Robbie, who lives in St Peter Port on Guernsey, spent most of his working life in the Trinity House Lighthouse Service at Hanois lighthouse.  Based a mile off the channel island, his messages floated away on tidal streams to far flung destinations including Florida, US. And one of them came into the possession of a German woman. Robbie was 50 when he received a reply from the woman, called Jutta, who was living in France at the time. The pair soon became pen pals. But over the coming months, they developed a romantic connection. One woman in France found one of my letters and wrote to me, recalled Robbie, who would spend more than a month on his own at a time. I got transferred to Alderney light house and while I was there she came over and visited me. She was divorced and I was divorced so we struck up a relationship. That was good, she was from France but she was a German lady.  I was 50 at the time, she was 42 or 43. She had auburn hair and was very good looking. It was the sort of thing I would have dreamed about as a younger man. You could say that. During a break in his casual relationship with Jutta, Robbie ended up getting engaged to a former partner. He continued: Later on when I was back on land I got married to an older girlfriend so I had to break it off. But when I got divorced 10 years later she got in touch and she came over and she spent Christmas with me but the magic had gone. I was young and handsome then, I\u0027m old and ugly now. Robbie used to spend 56 days at a time living a solitary existence in his lighthouse - maintaining the lights and keeping watch for ships.  To quell his boredom, he began throwing bottles into the sea. Over his 27 years in the job, he says he hurled thousands of bottles into the water, each containing a similar, simple message. He claims he received hundreds of replies. I just thought one day let\u0027s stick a message in a bottle and see what happens, he said. After a month I got one reply, and I thought this is a good idea. It was a good way to contact people, being on a lighthouse is quite lonely. I used to put 10 or 12 in a week, I would use any sort of bottle, plastic, glass, mustard jars, and marble tin containers, anything that floated. I’d probably get prosecuted now. The note I had written in it was quite simple.  The message read, \u0027this bottle was thrown into sea from the Hanois lighthouse, which is one mile of the south-west coast of Guernsey, if you find it please let me know when and where you found it\u0027. Although Robbie has fond memories of his time in the lighthouse service, he also experienced tragedy when his teenage son drowned. The then-lighthouse keeper was on Guernsey when the 19-year-old fisherman, Paul, got into trouble in nearby waters while alone. He drowned right by the lighthouse, said Robbie. I was ashore at the time when it happened, he was only 19. He was a fisherman and was in his boat and it sank. We don\u0027t know what happened, he was on his own so we don\u0027t know for sure. Although Robbie left the lighthouse service around 20 years ago, some of his messages are still being found.

Cliveden House Hotel, on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate in Taplow, Berkshire, boasts of its 350-year history and of hosting debaucherous parties and scandalous affairs. The American Suits star will stay with her mother Doria Ragland at the luxury accommodation, where a deluxe suite costs from \u0026pound1,195 a night. And a stay in its three-bedroom Spring Cottage, complete with Aga, is priced from \u0026pound2,055. In 1961 the hotel took centre stage in the early days of one of the most infamous scandals ever to rock British politics. It was there that then-secretary of state for war John Profumo first spotted 19-year-old Christine Keeler skinny dipping in an outdoor pool at Cliveden House.  They went on to to have an illicit affair and Profumo was forced to quit his job amid great political scandal following lurid disclosures of high-society sex parties and claims he had shared his mistress with a Soviet defence attache. The hotel\u0027s spa has in the past offered nail polishes named Scandal and Profumo. Built in 1666 by the 2nd Duke of Buckingham as a gift to his mistress, the privately owned Grade-I listed stately home is surrounded by 376 acres of National Trust grounds. Prince Harry will spend the night 15 miles away at the Dorchester Collection\u0027s Coworth Park in Ascot, with his best man and brother the Duke of Cambridge, Kensington Palace revealed.  The prince and the duke know the hotel well and play regularly on Coworth Park\u0027s world class polo grounds, managed by Guards Polo Club, and last year Ms Markle watched Harry compete. Coworth Park is owned by the Dorchester Collection hotel group, which is part of the Brunei Investment Agency, which controls some of Brunei\u0027s sovereign wealth. The hotel group faced a boycott in 2014 when the Sultan of Brunei announced a law to punish gay people with death by stoning, with Stephen Fry among those who cancelled a stay at Coworth Park. The hotel describes itself as the scenic route to five-star bliss offering an oasis of calm, so it would appear Harry could be having a sedate night before his wedding.

Speculation is rife about how she\u0027ll be prepping for the big day - from her hair and dress choice, to her diet and exercise regime. She\u0027s been refreshingly honest about her love for fitness in the past, and it\u0027s no surprise - with a yoga instructor for a mother and gym-obsessed pals like Millie Mackintosh. Meghan\u0027s enviable body clearly isn\u0027t just down to good genetics. But there\u0027s one tough workout that the future royal absolutely swears by when it comes to shredding fat and staying lean. Apparently she\u0027s a massive fan of the Megaformer, an intense full-body fitness class that takes place on a souped-up Reformer Pilates machine. She\u0027s been quoted praising Megaformer workouts as hands down the best thing you could do for your body, and is rumoured to be a big fan of Studio Lagree, the LA-fitness export that\u0027s fast catching on over here in the UK. Kim Kardashian and Chrissy Teigen are also said to be fans of the Lagree fitness method, which utilises the Megaformer machine and now has four studios in London. So how hard actually is it? I went and tried the class for myself at the studio\u0027s newest outpost in London\u0027s Nobu Hotel.  Here\u0027s what happened... The Megaformer machines are pretty complicated. As I enter the room, I\u0027m greeted by rows and rows of machines that look not too dissimilar to dark, leathery torture devices. If you\u0027ve ever tried Reformer Pilates, you\u0027d be forgiven for thinking the two workouts might be similar - both machines have a central carriage that slides back and forth, attached to a row of springs for resistance. But get closer and you\u0027ll realise there are plenty more bells and whistles to play with on the Megaformer - from cutouts and handles to feet and arm straps. These are designed to bring you to a higher threshold of intensity, testing your core, endurance, cardio, balance, strength and flexibility all at once. Navigating the precarious padded table (which moves with you) in the first 10 minutes of the class can be quite daunting, but the instructors are always on-hand to correct your form. Unlike Reformers, the machines also have handy position markings so you can make sure you\u0027re lined up correctly. It might just be the hardest workout you\u0027ll ever do. Don\u0027t be fooled by the cute names for the movements, like bear, mermaid and catfish.  One of the most surprising things about the Megaformer workout is just how ab-crushingly difficult it is, and I feel personally betrayed when a move called sexy back reduces me to a hideously unattractive, sweaty mess. I make the mistake of trying to rush through the movements, and my instructor Matt McEgmont soon pulls me up on my pace. In Megaformer, it\u0027s all about excruciatingly slow movements - the slower you go, the better results you see, and there\u0027s very little rest between each position. One of the most challenging movements involves pushing the table backwards and forwards with my forearms, while holding a plank position. My abs are completely on fire and I look like a flailing fish. The carriage is spring-loaded with resistance that ranges from 0 to about 115 kg, so you can make controlling the table with your legs and arms as challenging as you like. Because you always have some part of your body on the carriage (which is on wheels and in motion), you\u0027re also constantly challenging your core to keep you balanced.  Within 10 minutes my legs and arms are uncontrollably shaking from the resistance load and I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027ll actually have to give up part way through. People often describe Megaformer with words like humbling and crushing, and McEgmont assures my that the shaking is totally normal - apparently the workout has reduced everyone from bodybuilders and professional athletes to quaking messes. But it\u0027s OK to feel like you\u0027re terrible at it. According to McEgmont, failure is good. The Lagree Method is focused on working the muscles to failure, he tells me. That\u0027s right, to get the most of the workout you actually want to feel like you\u0027re ready to give up. The method integrates the key elements of resistance and counter-resistance in a sequence that allows for zero-gravity at peak muscle contraction, encouraging maximum exertion while allowing for a low risk of injury.

Thomas Markle fears he will suffer another heart attack due to the emotional distress from the fallout over his deal with a paparazzi agency.  The 73-year-old made the shock decision to pull out of the royal wedding on Monday after he was caught staging photographs.  He is believed to have been experiencing new chest pains after suffering a heart attack six days ago.  Thomas reportedly told TMZ that the pains have been triggered by emotional upset, and specifically mentioned his oldest daughter, Samantha Grant. Samantha had a very public falling out with Meghan in the lead up to the wedding and has claimed the paparazzi stunt was her idea.   Thomas told TMZ : I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.  Thomas pulled out of the big day on Saturday amid fears his presence at the ceremony would cause his daughter and the Royal Family major embarrassment. The news will have thrown Meghan into turmoil, her half-brother Thomas Markle Junior has said last night. A friend of Meghan and her fianc\u0026eacute, said Meghan obviously wants her dad there and she was standing by her father and pleaded for understanding, saying he was not in a good place and are begging for people to give him some space.  Harry, 33, is reportedly blaming himself, with the friend telling the Daily Mail : He feels that anyone who gets associated with his life – this is the price they have to pay.    Follow our latest updates on the wedding countdown here .    Kensington Palace had insisted on Sunday that Thomas would be walking Meghan down the aisle before she tied the knot with Prince Harry at Windsor Castle, despite the pictures scam. And he claimed he suffered a heart attack last Tuesday but checked himself out of the hospital for the wedding. Reports in the US said last night he did not catch the flight he was due on to London today. Son Thomas Jr, 51, told the Daily Mirror: “Meg will be frantic, she’ll want to know how he is. I’m deeply concerned about him.  As much as he was dreading all eyes being on him he will not want to cause any embarrassment or deflect attention away from Meghan and Harry’s day. “He’ll be devastated not to be going but also relieved.” A friend said: This is not what she wants. She obviously wants her dad there. And the idea of contemplating him not being there now is not something that she wants to have to do. He is clearly feeling under immense pressure. The concern for him is real and genuine. \u0027He is a proud man who wants to be a father and not be taken care of, but it\u0027s quite difficult. Everyone needs to pause and think what this is doing to them and, more importantly, to him.  The friend also said Harry was devastated at the situation, adding: He feels like this is another thing in the wake of him... the problems he causes. He wants to protect her and this is really difficult for him to swallow. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.”  Thomas had vowed to apologise to Meghan, 36, and the royals over the staged photos with US-based British photographer Jeff Rayner. The shots came after he claimed he had been harassed by snappers. Reports in America said Thomas admitted the shots, near his home in Rosarito, Mexico, look “stupid and hammy” and he “deeply regrets” the episode. The pictures included ones of him looking at internet photos of Meghan and Harry, 33, and being measured for his wedding suit.

A huge swarm was spotted in Newcastle\u0027s St James’ Park on Sunday and tried their best to ruin alfresco lunches for those who wanted to make the most of Monday’s warm weather. With social media full of posts complaining about the greenfly ‘plague’, Dr Gordon Port from Newcastle University’s School of Natural Environmental Sciences explained why there are so many greenflies in the skies. It’s because of the weather  Dr Port told Chronicle Live that the light winds, warm temperatures and rapid onset of spring have combined to cause the greenfly plague.  “Every year greenfly feed on plants at the start of their life cycle, as plants come into leaf in the spring.   Swarms of bloodsucking flies that leave huge blisters and groin swelling set to cause havoc in hot weather  In most years the weather is more varied, but we’ve had a spell of really nice, warm conditions over the last week, causing the number of greenfly to go up and up. They’re mating and thinking, ‘we need to find some new food now’.” Light winds mean the greenflies are not scattering “They’re weak flies. They take off and let the wind carry them where it can and see if they can land near the right food,” Dr Port said.  And usually, this method let\u0027s them hitch a ride on the wind to find new sources of foods. However, the wind has not been very strong, so the greenflies have not blown across the country. So they are concentrated in bigger groups, all searching for food across a smaller area. Dr Port added: “In average weather conditions they get blown away quickly, but when it’s relatively still and warm, like this, we tend to notice them.” The flies you’re seeing today are sycamore aphids "},{"url":null,"title":"princess dianas wedding dress designer","story":"NewsWhy Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer was \u0027horrified\u0027 when she saw her in the gownPrincess Diana\u0027s ivory silk taffeta and antique lace wedding dress is still regarded as one of the most beautiful gowns of all time\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseySocial Audience Writer13:29, 14 MAY 2018Updated17:51, 14 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email To this day, 36 years after she walked down the aisle, Princess Diana’s wedding dress is still one of the most iconic gowns of all time.

But there was one person who wasn’t happy when she first saw the dress - the woman who designed and made it. Elizabeth Emanuel and her husband spent months creating the stunning ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown. The dress reportedly cost \u0026pound9,000 at the time, and featured puffed sleeves and more then 10,000 pearls.

They had done a dress rehearsal but using a different material, and it wasn\u0027t anywhere near as bad.

And now, a secret shopper has found out just how much cheaper Aldi is than its supermarket rivals - from Asda and Tesco to Waitrose. The discount store swept the board in the High Street supermarket price survey this week, based on a trolley of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items. Its shopping basket was more than \u0026pound4 cheaper than its nearest rival in the survey - Asda - according to a report published yesterday. The price difference highlights a reason behind the proposed merger between Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s, which was announced last month.  The stores have come under growing pressure from many Brits switching to discounters like Aldi and Lidl to save money on their weekly shop. Trade magazine The Grocer carries out a weekly mystery shopping basket survey checking the prices of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items at the five major supermarket chains - but this week added Aldi as a guest retailer. It found that while Aldi shoppers paid \u0026pound33.14 for their basket of goods, customers at nearest rival Asda paid \u0026pound4.41 more, at \u0026pound37.55. Sainsbury\u0027s was ranked next at \u0026pound39.51 - which was \u0026pound6.37 more expensive than Aldi - followed by Tesco, Morrisons and Waitrose.  The Grocer said: Guest retailer Aldi claimed a convincing win over its traditional supermarket rivals this week - and in doing so illustrated one of the key reasons why Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s feel the need to merge. Aldi\u0027s \u0026pound33.14 total was \u0026pound4.41 cheaper than Asda, helped by offering the lowest price for 27 of the 33 items on our list. Twenty three of these were exclusively cheaper than any of its rivals. This makes Asda 13.3 per cent more expensive and while the gap has closed from 16.5 per cent in January, drastic measures appear to be needed if Asda is to genuinely close the price gap to the discounters.  It added: Hence the Sainsbury\u0027s merger - should a post-deal Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s live up to their promise to cut many everyday prices by 10 per cent, Asda in particular would start to look a lot more competitive. Sainsbury\u0027s, which last week also invested \u0026pound35 million in reducing the price of selected meat and fish products, actually managed to grab third spot this week. Although at \u0026pound39.51 it was \u0026pound6.37 and 19.2 per cent more expensive than Aldi. Tesco was 21.5 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound40.70, a difference of \u0026pound7.56. As our shopping list was heavily weighted towards own label, Tesco\u0027s Brand Guarantee scheme had little impact on the final standings. Our shopper had 45p taken off her bill at the checkout which still left it \u0026pound7.11 more expensive than Aldi.  Morrisons was over 25 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound41.68. In the case of sixth-placed Waitrose the difference was even greater - the \u0026pound14.86 difference on its \u0026pound48 basket makes it 44.8 per cent more expensive. Waitrose also had just two products on deal. This compared with Asda\u0027s nine, Aldi\u0027s eight, Morrisons\u0027 six and four each at Sainsbury\u0027s and Tesco.

People across the UK will be digging out their flip flops, sunglasses and shorts again as they enjoy a glorious burst of warmth and sun after the weekend washout. Forecasters say summer-like conditions are expected to make a comeback over the next couple of days, banishing the cool and unsettled westerly airflow that kept the mercury subdued over the weekend. They predict the best of the warm weather will be in the south-east, where locals and tourists in the capital could bask in 22C heat. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE THE FORECAST FOR YOUR AREA       In comparison, 20C highs are expected on the holiday hotspot Ibiza - while 17C temperatures and showers are predicted in the Italian capital. Figures will linger around the high teens and low 20s for the rest of the UK. Today, temperatures will rise sharply, reaching highs of 19C widely - even in parts of Scotland - as high pressure lures a welcome brief burst of warmth and sunshine from south-west Europe, according to forecasters. Values are expected to continue to rise into tomorrow, with temperatures predicted to soar up to 4-8C above average for the time of year. Eleanor Bell, principal meteorologist of The Weather Channel , said almost all of the country will enjoy drier, brighter and warmer climates today.  However, a north-south weather divide will mean clearer skies and sunny spells will be replaced by scattered showers in Scotland and north-west England by tomorrow afternoon. She added: High pressure is expected to build early next week with warmer air from the south- west mixing in. This along with increasing sunshine will allow temperatures to lift above normal. Maximum temperatures will be around 16-18C on Monday, lifting to 18-22C on Tuesday. But it will be cooler over the north-west, 13-17C, with more in the way of cloud and showers there. According to the Met Office, parts of the south-east could see 23C highs tomorrow, with the best temperatures likely around Southampton.  And looking ahead to the weekend, it is thought Prince Harry, 33, and actress Meghan Markle, 36, will also enjoy sunshine as they tie the knot. Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “The week ahead will see a lot of fine weather from Monday, and that is likely to continue for the royal wedding. “Early indications are for Saturday in Windsor to be dry and bright with highs around 18C, a touch above the 17C average. “This Tuesday could see 25C in the South, before highs return to normal on Wednesday and then edge upwards again on Saturday.” Below, you can find out the forecast for your area for today and tomorrow. North East England Although this morning may have been chilly, most people in the North East are set to enjoy warm weather by this afternoon. The sunshine will be largely unbroken and the conditions will be dry, with maximum temperatures of around 18C.  But the Met Office warns: Some mist may encroach onto coasts later in the day, together with cooling coastal breezes. Tomorrow, it will be warm inland with long sunny periods, but coastal areas could see cooler conditions with fog patches. Some places are set to enjoy 19C highs. North West England This region will see plenty of warm sunshine throughout today, with a light wind and largely cloud-free skies, the Met Office says. Temperatures of up to 20C are expected. Tomorrow morning will also see warm sunshine, but cloud and a few spots of rain could arrive for some later in the day. Again, the area could enjoy highs of 20C.  West Midlands Those in the West Midlands can expect glorious weather today - with sunshine, warm temperatures and barely a cloud in the sky. The Met Office says: After a chilly start to the day, plenty of warm sunshine will develop. The wind will be light and there will barely be a cloud in the sky into the afternoon and evening. Temperatures could hit 21C - and tomorrow is set to be even warmer. The weather service adds: Tuesday will start cold, however there will be some unbroken warm sunshine through the day. For some cloud will build into the afternoon but it will stay dry. Maximum temperature 22 \u0026degC. Yorkshire and Humber Like other areas, Yorkshire and Humber will have seen a rather chilly start. But this afternoon, it will be warm in most areas with dry conditions and largely unbroken sunshine, forecasters say.   The region could see highs of 20C, but some mist and cooling coastal breezes could encroach onto coasts later today. Tomorrow is also expected to be warm and sunny, with temperatures as high as 21C. However, there could be light winds. East Midlands The forecast here is similar to that of Yorkshire and Humber - it will be warm for many inland areas with largely unbroken sunshine. Conditions are also expected to be dry, forecasters say. Temperatures could reach 20C - potentially soaring to 22C by tomorrow. The Met Office says it will also be warm inland tomorrow, but low cloud, fog patches and cooler conditions may occasionally affect coasts. It adds: Then cloudier overnight with patchy rain, and becoming breezy.  Wales People in Wales can expect to enjoy plenty of warm sunshine today, with temperatures as high as 20C. The wind will be light, but we could see some patches of low cloud in the far west, the Met Office predicts. It adds that there will also be warm sunshine tomorrow, with largely cloud-free skies - although the coast will be cooler. Temperatures of up to 21C are expected. London and South East England Western areas are set to enjoy warm, sunny weather today - as temperatures soar to 21C (and a staggering 23C by tomorrow). The Met Office says: Becoming warm for western areas by the afternoon, often sunny, and most places dry, but perhaps cloudier here later.   Generally cloudy in eastern counties, with cooling breezes across Kent coasts and hills, and a few spots of drizzle possible. It adds that, tomorrow, most areas will be warm and sunny by the afternoon, with the best temperatures likely around Southampton. South West England Again, despite a chilly start, this region will see plenty of warm sunshine today. However, the Met Office warns it will be cooler in the far west. Highs of 19C are expected. Tomorrow is also set to be warm and sunny, with largely cloud-free skies. But areas on the coast could see cloud and cooler conditions. Temperatures could soar to 20C, forecasters predict.  East England It will be warm, sunny and mostly dry in the west today, forecasters say. However, the conditions in eastern counties will be generally cloudy with cooling breezes, coastal mist, fog and a few spots of drizzle. The region will see maximum temperatures of around 19C. Tomorrow, low cloud, fog patches and cooler conditions will become confined to coasts, according to the Met Office. Many inland areas will be warm and sunny by the afternoon. Temperatures could hit 20C. Northern Ireland After a cloudy morning, Northern Ireland is expected to see a little afternoon sunshine, with warmer weather and light winds. The area could see highs of 18C today. Tomorrow, it is set to be a dry start with bright spells in the east. The afternoon will be dry and bright in some places, forecasters say. Unlike other areas, a lower high has been predicted for tomorrow - 17C. Scotland Most parts will experience a dry, sunny and warm day, forecasters say. Those in Edinburgh can expect to see plenty of sunshine - with temperatures set to soar to as high as 19C. Tomorrow is also expected to start off dry and sunny, although some areas of the country could see cloudy, damp weather throughout the day.

While it sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, for one mum the dilemma is all too real and unpleasant.  Having helped her mother-in-law with several aspects of her wedding - and kept costs down in the process - the mum has now found herself snubbed from the nuptials.  Even more gallingly, her husband and young daughters are all part of the wedding party.  Erm, what?    My mother-in-law and I have historically had a slightly tense relationship, she explains on Mumsnet .  However, she adds how things have, over time, got a lot better between her and her mother-in-law and they now have a generally good relationship.  She goes on to explain that while geography means she\u0027s not able to offer practical help with her grandkids, she is a lovely, thoughtful, interested granny, which I am grateful for. The mum even adds that it\u0027s her who keeps in touch with her mother-in-law, as her husband is busy and a man of few words. So, nothing so far to cause any alarm bells to ring. Now. My mother-in-law is engaged. Planning wedding. Is not very well off, thus wants me to buy dresses so my two daughters can be bridesmaids.  I have offered to make some decorations etc to keep cost down. And needs my husband kitted up so he can give her away. Also fine. And needs us all to fly over and find accommodation and hire car. We are a bit tight financially too, which my mother-in-law is aware of, but this is a special occasion, so no problem, we\u0027ll find the money. Again, so far, so good. Everyone is playing nicely - especially the daughter-in-law, who sounds like a wedding-planning angel - and there\u0027s no reason to think anyone harbours anyone else any ill will. At least, until the mother-in-law dropped a bombshell.  The mum continues: [She] has decided to hold ceremony in very small place that can only accommodate the wedding party. I.e. she wants me to have invested quite a bit of time, effort and money into her wedding but I have to wait at pub while my husband and daughters, sister-in-law, brother-in-law and nieces etc attend it and then just go to reception.

A 60 Minutes investigation by Nine News in Australia that aired tonight features a panel of aviation experts working to determine what brought the plane down. Since March 2014 the world has questioned how a Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished into thin air en route from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Most of the wreckage has never been found but now but now experts say they finally have the answers. Larry Vance, former senior investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told the Australian current affairs programme he was confident he knows what happened to the aircraft.  “I think the general public can take comfort in the fact that there is a growing consensus on the plane’s final moments,” he said. The panel believe that the man in the cockpit, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was responsible. They all agree the pilot “was killing himself” and took the plane to the most remote spot he could so it would “disappear”.  Boeing 777 pilot and instructor Simon Hardy said Captain Zaharie avoided detection of the plane by either Malaysian or Thai military radar by flying along the border, crossing in and out of each nation\u0027s airspace. Mr Hard told the programme: “As the aircraft went across Thailand and Malaysia, it runs down the border, which is wiggling underneath, meaning it\u0027s going in and out of those two countries, which is where their jurisdictions are.  “So both of the controllers aren\u0027t bothered about this mysterious aircraft. Cause it\u0027s, \u0027Oh, it\u0027s gone. It\u0027s not in our space anymore\u0027. “If you were commissioning me to do this operation and try and make a 777 disappear, I would do exactly the same thing. “As far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s very accurate flying because think it did the job and we know, as a fact, that the military did not come and intercept the aircraft.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero pilot lands plane after","story":"NewsHero pilot lands plane after cockpit window suddenly SHATTERS at terrifying 32,000ftThe Chinese passenger plane had to make a dramatic emergency landing after the windscreen broke off and the aircraft dropped in altitude\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary14:46, 14 MAY 2018Updated18:10, 14 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hero pilot landed a plane after the cockpit window shattered at a terrifying 32,000ft.

Bilel Mohsni also looks set to miss out because of the groin injury he picked up right at the end of that morale-sapping 3-2 play off defeat.Immediately after the final whistle gaffer Csaba Laszlo expressed his concern the nature of Mohsni’s injury meant the centre-half would not make the four-day turnaround between games.Two days on the Tunisian international is still struggling to recover.Given his influence on the defence since he arrived March, his absence would be a major setback.“I don’t think in this short time he will be recovered but we are a team and we have to show also that we can stand up,” said Csaba.Mark Durnan is a ready-made replacement for the 30-year-old but problems with an ankle injury mean he hasn’t started a game since the win over champions St Mirren a month ago.Meanwhile, the first of Flood’s two bookings on Monday means he will miss the start of next season under the totting up process.Although United have already lost twice a Livingston

So I am delighted to see the remarkable breadth and depth of the expertise within our 48 new Fellows.\u0026#8220We look forward to these experts joining us in addressing the health challenges we face head on and exploiting opportunities to improve health in the UK and internationally.”The new Fellows will be formally admitted to the Academy at a ceremony on 27 June 2018.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af04ec3c94e9-381x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee women sarah spends five months creating tapestry artwork of dundee royal infirmary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWow, the detail in this cross-stitch tapestry is truly amazing.Following a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, Sarah Anderson spent five months completing the artwork immortalising Dundee Royal Infirmary in 1997.Sarah can be seen showing the piece to Dr Ken Morley and Dr Malcolm MacLean who had supported her through her illness.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Tracy-Palmer-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people i was physically shaking when i got the news says dundee professor being elected a fellow of the royal society","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProfessor Tracy Palmer of the University of Dundee has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), the world\u0026#8217s oldest scientific academy in continuous existence.“Being made a Fellow of the Royal Society is something I have dreamt of but you can never really expect it is going to happen,” Tracy said.“I was physically shaking when I got the news, because I couldn’t quite believe it.“For any scientist this is a major landmark in a career and I am deeply honoured.”Tracy holds a Chair in Molecular Microbiology in the School of Life Sciences at Dundee.Being made Fellow of the Royal Society is a major honour for any scientist.The Fellowship of the Royal Society is made up of the most eminent scientists, engineers and technologists from the UK and the Commonwealth. Past Fellows and Foreign Members have included Newton, Darwin and Einstein.Tracy’s first degree was in Biochemistry at the University of Birmingham. She joined the School of Life Sciences at Dundee from her previous post at the John Innes Centre in July 2007.In 2009 she became head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology. She has received numerous awards throughout her career. In 2002 she jointly received the Microbiology Society Fleming Prize with her longstanding collaborator Ben Berks for their description of the bacterial Tat pathway.She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2009, a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2015, and a Member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 2017.Her group were one of the first to describe the Tat system, an unusual pathway that bacteria use to secrete proteins into the environment. This pathway is used by bacteria to transport proteins that cause disease in humans and animals, and that can degrade antibiotics such as penicillin.More recently, she has also worked on another protein secretion system, named Type VII, in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.Her group demonstrated that S. aureus uses this system to secrete a toxin that kills neighbouring bacteria, a process which is likely to be critical to allow the bacterium to compete with other organisms when it colonises the human body.She is set to take up a new position at Newcastle University in August 2018.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af401ada4aa0-862x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people the royal visits to dundee of yesteryear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tToday’s Dundonian is packed full of great archive photographs taken during royal visits to the City of Discovery down the years.There are pictures of the Queen, Princess Diana and other members of the royal family visiting various venues around the city.Check out the people in the backgrounds too — you might spot someone you know lining up to get a glimpse of the royal visitors.

Despite the disagreement, I had no further problems with the manager.“In the end he rewarded me. I am grateful for it.“The most important thing is that the club is safe.“If you do not play it is difficult but the people within the club have always supported me. Then this is very nice.”With a future in Dundee not certain after such a long time out of favour, Wolters doesn’t know what the future holds.He said: “I’m just waiting.“In any case, I know how it

park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManagers at a city retail park have started legal action against a group of Travellers who have set up camp outside a recently-closed toy store.Last week, the Tele reported that two motorhomes and three caravans had parked at Kingsway West Retail Park.The Travellers set up camp immediately outside Toys ‘R’ Us, which closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.Three of the caravans are parked on disabled parking spaces which are still in operation and fixtures such as barbecues have been erected by the occupants.Site managers working on behalf of the retail park confirmed to the Tele that they were taking the “necessary legal actions” to move the Travellers off the site.A spokesman said: “Both the owner and management team are aware of the occupiers in situ outside the store.“They do not have permission to be on site and as such have been served notice that they must leave the land immediately.“The necessary legal actions are being taken to remove them from the retail park.”Both Dundee City Council and Police Scotland confirmed they were aware of the Travellers’ arrival at the retail park, just yards away from other stores which are continuing to operate.When the Tele approached those living on the site, a man with an Irish accent swore through a crack in his window and said: “Mind your own business.”Only one resident opened their door but closed it immediately after being shown press ID.While the Toys ‘R’ Us store is shut, the unit in which the store operated and the land outside it is owned by fund management firm ARES and operated by the property firm GVA.The site is not licensed for the purposes of camping — meaning those who set up caravans there are doing so illegally.The council operates a licensed site for Travellers just outside Dundee at Balmuir Wood, Tealing.Twenty pitches are available at Balmuir Wood for Travelling communities, each of which features electricity supplies, utility rooms with showers and toilets and 24-hour access.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier (for example, a tenant) can take steps to evict you.“If the landowner or occupier does decide to evict you, they may apply to the court for an interdict or possession order requiring you to move off the land, ask the council to take action, ask the police to take action or move you on themselves.”A council spokeswoman said the local authority was aware of and was monitoring the situation.\u0026#8216Mind your own business\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 Travellers move in to car park

mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann hailed a “magnificent” defensive display from his side as they laid to rest any relegation worries with a 1-0 win at Ross County.Going into the game in Dingwall, the Dark Blues were still not mathematically assured of survival, with Partick Thistle six points behind with two games to play.In the end, Thistle’s defeat at home to Motherwell meant Dundee would be safe anyway.However, Neil and his players wanted to get the job done themselves and did so thanks to Simon Murray’s 51st-minute header.Neil said: “It’s always a horrible position to be in.“I came into the job in this sort of position last season and it wasn’t enjoyable but we did the business pretty quickly in our first three games but Tuesday night it was still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball and began to play a wee bit.“I was unhappy with them at half-time with the start of the game and, indeed, at the start of the second we coughed up a chance.“However, when we play we know we are a difficult side to contain and we were always looking to hit them on the break once we got the first goal.”With their own survival at stake, the Staggies were desperate for a goal that could give them a lifeline.The Dundee defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it. There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.

That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Tuesday 15 May 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04092000/04092368.jpg","title":"Demand for tougher A82 safety measures","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCampaigners have warned that pedestrians or cyclists could die unnecessarily because there is currently only one set of traffic lights on the entire, busy stretch between the West Link and the Ness Bridge \u0026ndash at the Kenneth Street junction.Despite years of community pressure for safer crossings, a lengthy review by roads agency Transport Scotland has concluded that cosmetic change is ample.It has pinpointed several locations for more prominent road islands, road redesign and new signposts. The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road. It\u0027 a great worry. I don\u0026rsquot know how mums with small children cope with the traffic.Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoA cont-rolled crossing is the only way to improve safety. Glenurquhart Road is busy with very dangerous crossroads.\u0026ldquoThe new (West Link) bridge has taken a lot of traffic off the road but that\u0027 made it faster because the traffic now moves more freely. There\u0027 a greater risk of accidents.Agency representatives acknowledged that there had been one fatal accident involving a pedestrian and 14 other collisions \u0026ndash three of them \u0026ldquoserious \u0026ndash involving pedestrians or cyclists along the city stretch of A82 between 2013 and 2017.The proposed upgrades would be in Longman Road, Kenneth Street, the Tomnahurich Street-Planefield Road junction, the Glenurquhart Road-Park Ro-ad-Bishops Road junction, and at the West Link roundabout.The agency envisages \u0026ldquowidened pavements and islands to shorten the crossing distance at various locations, additional pedestrian crossing facilities at the A82 Kenneth Street-Tomnahurich Street junction signals and a shared footway and cycleway facility between Longman and Telford roundabouts.A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll present draft options to the public at an information day where we\u0026rsquoll seek their feedback.Cllr Boyd said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll keep the pressure on.Tuesday 15 May 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04003000/04003573.jpg","title":"Help offered to Highland Council is the business","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Chamber of Commerce has offered to host a summit on the key issues.The invitation follows a rallying call for the public to \u0026ldquohelp themselves by lobbying MPs and MSPs on the council\u0027 behalf, to highlight the need for extra revenue to protect and strengthen services.The independent-led minority administration also urged anyone with novel ideas for boosting the local authority\u0027 finances to make contact.The Scottish Government disputes it, but council convener Bill Lobban insists that council funding has been \u0026ldquocut, in real terms, by 9.6 percent since 2010.Administration leaders are preparing a document for Scottish Government ministers explaining why Highland is a \u0026ldquospecial case due to its vast geography.The council has been proactive in reviewing its entire work practices through a cross-party \u0026ldquoredesign board with a mission to be more business-like. The chamber is now on board.Its chief executive Stewart Nicol said: \u0026ldquoTo do everything we can to support this new endeavour by the council, I\u0026rsquove written to council leader Margaret Davidson and offered to organise a joint symposium where our 420 members can provide ideas and feedback.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure our members will be glad to hear of this initiative from the council and of having a platform to contribute to its success.The council\u0027 latest annual accounts show annual spending of \u0026pound749 million and income of \u0026pound208 million. The difference is made up by Scottish Government grants and council tax.Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey SNP MP Drew Hendry cited the Inverness City-Region Deal as a good example of collaborative work.\u0026ldquoRegardless of whether I\u0026rsquom asked or not, I\u0026rsquoll continue to raise many issues relating to the Highland economy on behalf of the council\u0027 officers and politicians, the business community and constituents, he said.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the involvement of the business sector and agreed that Highland is unique.\u0026ldquoIt has over 7000km of roads to maintain, over 2000 bridges and culverts to upkeep, he said.He acknowledged local government organisation Cosla\u0027 agreement to give Highland a larger share of extra funding to tackle potholes \u0026ldquobecause the authority has the largest landmass to cover.What do you think the council could do to save money?

Clearly the show is very much about farming and we still have all the different classes and it\u0027 very much a competition for the farming fraternity.\u0026ldquoHowever, to make the event sustainable we have had to diversify and introduce new attractions \u0026ndash often still with a farming theme, but that appeal to those who have little or no farming background at all.Music will also play a big part in this year\u0027 event with live music to suit all tastes all day in the bar marquee.Monster trucks Big Pete and the Grim Reaper will take to the main arena to wow the crowds.

Mr Hendry branded it the \u0026ldquoworst kind of postcode lottery and asked the Department of Work and Pensions minister to make urgent changes.And he also called on the minister to follow the Scottish government\u0027 lead and remove the legal definition of terminal illness, currently set at six months by the UK government.\u0026ldquoUnder existing UK government rules, people with conditions such as terminal heart failure, motor neurone disease and other terminal conditions need to apply for social security in the usual way and are subject to the normal assessments, including work assessments.\u0026ldquoThey are quite simply not considered terminal enough \u0026ndash this policy exposes a Tory government at its very worst and they are wilfully failing families dealing with the trauma of terminal illness.\u0026ldquoPeople who are dying should not be forced to go to appointments with work coaches, nor should they have to spend their last month\u0027 fighting for much needed financial support.\u0026ldquoEven those who fall under the UK government\u0027 \u0026lsquosix months to live\u0026rsquo definition are subjected to heart-breaking waits for their financial support.Tuesday 15 May 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
