Meghan Markle revealed her dreams about becoming a princess...Share this articleMarkle Sr said: \u0027I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: \u0027Daddy, I\u0027ve met a man… Daddy, he\u0027s English… Daddy, he\u0027s a prince.\u0027\u0027I thought it was a cute story. Like any father I wanted to say a few words. I was going to thank the Royal Family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.\u0027He also launched a defense of his decision to speak to the media and claimed his Mail on Sunday interview would be his last – although he went on to speak to a tabloid newspaper less than 24 hours later.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday night, he added: \u0027I want to say good luck and God bless to my daughter. I don\u0027t expect to see her or hear back from her — and that\u0027s OK.\u0027All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. I just want to re-establish the relationship with my daughter.\u0027I now want to go on vacation somewhere to try and get some peace.\u0027The latest round of interviews come just seven days after the 74-year-old spent nine hours with the Mail on Sunday, during which he admitted to a drug-taking past, said Princess Diana would have \u0027loathed\u0027 the way he is being treated and hit out at Prince Harry – saying: \u0027I don\u0027t care if Harry never speaks to me again, I\u0027ll survive.\u0027    The source accused Markle Sr of selling salacious interviews to the press, and claims he has spoken to the media more than he has tried to contact Meghan           Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha, 53, has also turned on her and has given multiple interviews slamming the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himselfHis outbursts in the press follow a series of statements made to gossip website TMZ during the period around the royal wedding in May, following the paparazzi photo scandal.Although Markle Sr had been due to attend – and had his name printed in the program – he pulled out last minute after claiming to have suffered a heart attack.Despite telling the Mail on Sunday that he spent the day in a San Diego hospital bed, Markle Sr actually watched the nuptials from a $31-a-night Airbnb in Baja Malibu – a scruffy residential compound close to his home in San Antonio del Mar.He returned home on the Monday after the wedding and was pictured purchasing a creamy drink from Starbucks en route.Since then, the retired Emmy winner has repeatedly spoken out about his daughter and has insisted that he will continue to do so until she contacts him.He has also been pictured out and about in Los Angeles, where he was spotted purchasing a McDonalds meal on his birthday last month. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Markle Sr has been repeatedly pictured tucking into fast food – including McDonalds Happy Meals and KFC the latter shortly after he revealed he had had a heart attack.Although ex-wife Doria has remained silent about the Markle debacle currently engulfing the royal family, Meghan\u0027s half-siblings have spoken out – with sister Samantha describing the Duchess\u0027s treatment of her father as \u0027inhumane\u0027.She told the Mirror newspaper on Monday: \u0027There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is.\u0027Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, later took to Twitter to lambaste her half-sister, describing her as \u0027heartless, arrogant and inhumane\u0027 in a series of late-night messages.The 53-year-old was echoed by her brother Thomas Markle Jr, 51, of Grants Pass, Oregon, who also slammed the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himself.He told the Mirror: \u0027It\u0027s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family.\u0027Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable.

She also claimed that the 47-year-old had taken acid before he sent that tweet           \u0027I saw him in the kitchen tucking his tail in between his legs scrounging for investors to cover his ass after that tweet,\u0027 she said of Musk over the weekend. \u0027He was stressed and red in the face.\u0027\u0027I waited around all weekend while Grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on Twitter while on acid,\u0027 she added on Instagram. In subsequent posts, Banks even suggested that the couple may have invited her to their home for \u0027some weird threesome sex s**t to begin with.\u0027She also went on a vicious rant about Grimes, who she branded an \u0027idiot, Musk who she called a \u0027beta male\u0027 and branded them both \u0027crackhead\u0027 in a rambling attack.A rep for Musk\u0027s dismissed Banks\u0027 claims as \u0027absolute nonsense.\u0027 They would not confirm whether or not Banks had spent the weekend at one of his homes.But the representative denied that Musk had ever met the rapper.       A spokesperson  told Business Insider: \u0027Elon has never even met Ms. Banks or communicated with her in any way.\u0027DailyMail.com has reached out for further comment. Tesla declined to comment on the claims about Musk looking for investors.Musk\u0027s extra-curricular activities hit the headlines earlier this year when he admitted attending a now infamous drug-fueled sex soiree in Silicon Valley in June 2017, but said he didn\u0027t know it was a sex party. \u0027Elon was at the party for a couple hours and left around 1am after talking with several DFJ-funded entrepreneurs about technology and building companies\u0027, said his reps.\u0027His impression was that it was a corporate party with a costume theme, not a \u0027\u0027sex party,\u0027\u0027 and there was no indication that it would become one after he left,\u0027 the statement concluded.The \u0027sex party\u0027 was held at former DFJ investor Steve Jurvetson\u0027s home.   Azealia Banks had announced in June that she and Grimes, a fellow singer and songwriter who began dating Musk earlier this year, were working together on Banks\u0027 second album.She said she arrived at one of Musk\u0027s homes in Los Angeles early on Friday but said she was left alone for days while Grimes comforted her boyfriend.\u0027Staying in Elon musks house has been like a real like episode of \u0027Get Out\u0027, she wrote.          Banks finally left on Sunday night. A separate source confirmed to the Insider that Banks was at one of Musk\u0027s properties over the weekend.Banks says Musk was panicked after his Tuesday tweet, when he announced he was considering taking the firm private at $420 per share, adding that funding was \u0027secured.\u0027 The surprise tweets caught the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with regulators looking into whether the statements were truthful and why Musk announced them via Twitter.Additionally, Musk and Tesla are being sued by investors who claim the plan to go private was part of a \u0027fraudulent scheme\u0027 to punish short-sellers, or investors who borrow stock in a company with the hope shares will fall. The plaintiffs also allege that Musk\u0027s announcements artificially inflated Tesla\u0027s stock price and violated securities laws. Shares of Tesla were sliding more than 1 percent to $351.80 on Monday morning.     Tesla boss Elon Musk shocked Wall Street last week when he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and that funding was secured          Musk added that investor support was \u0027confirmed\u0027 and that the Tesla board had already met \u0027several times\u0027 in the past few weeks to discuss the proposal to take the firm privateMusk attempted to clear up his tweets in the blog post Monday. \u0027Going back almost two years, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund has approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,\u0027 Musk wrote in the blog post. \u0027They first met with me at the beginning of 2017 to express this interest because of the important need to ersify away from oil.\u0027They then held several additional meetings with me over the next year to reiterate this interest and to try to move forward with a going private transaction,\u0027 Musk added. This isn\u0027t the first time Banks has made unproven claims against celebrities. In 2016, accused Beyoncé on Twitter of stealing from other artists, while in June this year, she was kicked off Twitter for insulting RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race contestant Monet X Change."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/12/05C0B2CA000007D0-6058987-image-a-14_1534244628971.jpg","title":"Pakistan Independence Day 2018 Google Doodle celebrates historic event","story":"    Pakistan ’s Independence Day has been marked in the Google Doodle for August 14, 2018Independence of PakistanIn August 1947, over 12 million people were forced to flee their homes to cross the new border formed in the centre of the British colony of India.

I don’t know what she was doing in London but she and my father met at a Spanish Civil War support committee.’ The family moved to Shropshire in 1956 when David changed jobs and stayed in a guesthouse outside Newport.All four boys attended Adams’ Grammar School and Piers said ‘Jeremy was a country bumpkin like me. When I first came to London in the Sixties I didn’t understand how lifts worked. I would have thought Jeremy would have had similar problems.’ Jeremy left school with two A Levels, both at grade E.After leaving school, he spent years in Jamaica with Voluntary Service Overseas and on his return to the UK, got involved in trade union activism, at first with the National Union of Tailors and Garment Makers. He then studied Trade Union Studies at North London Polytechnic, but left after arguing with tutors.He continued his career as a trade union organiser with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) and later, the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) before getting more involved in Labour politics.In 1974, he was elected to Haringey District Council in North London and soon became on the side of the quasi-Marxist hard left. As a follower of Tony Benn, he shared the view of democratic socialism and belief in worker controlled industries and state planned economy.Corbyn also ran the London Labour Briefing newspaper that shot Ken Livingstone to fame and power on the Greater London Council. He was elected to Parliament in 1983 to represent Islington North and has increased his majority from 5,600 to 21,000.He then spent a number of years on the backbench where he earned himself the title of Labour’s most rebellious MP, defying party leaders more than 500 times. Jeremy and his allies attached themselves to campaigns against British and American imperialism or the Israeli state. Today, as Labour leader, Jeremy’s election was noted as one of the biggest upsets in British political history after he saw off Owen Smith, who had the backing of the majority of MPs in the party, according to the BBC.            Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks through a demonstration against President Trump\u0027s visitKnown as a ‘bearded leftie’, he has been a presence at multiple demonstrations and marches across his 40 year career and like Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, belongs to a dying group of politicians who held onto socialism as Labour took a step to the right under Tony Blair.During the 2015 leadership contest, Corbyn revealed to The Guardian that he acted as the token left-wing candidate who wanted to ‘broaden the debate’. He continued to say: ‘Well, Diane and John have done it before, so it was my turn.Jeremy then said: ‘Yeah. I have never held any appointed office, so in that sense it’s unusual, but if I can promote some causes and debates by doing this, then good. That’s why I’m doing it,’ adding that ‘At my age I’m not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?’Soon after, Corbynmania erupted and the politician struck a chord with many young activists who had lost faith during the Blair and Brown years. Although coming from a middle-class background, Jeremy said that he doesn’t ‘spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don’t have a car.’Jeremy Corbyn wifeAfter being elected to Haringey District Council, he married fellow Labour councillor Jane Chapman, who was also a university lecturer. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, she said: ‘Politics became our life. He was out most evenings because when we weren’t at meetings he would go to the Labour headquarters, and do photocopying’.She continued to say that in the five years that they were together, he never took her out for dinner and Corbyn preferred to ‘grab a can of beans and eat it straight from the can.’In 1987, Jeremy married Chilean exile Claudia Bracchitta, with whom he had three sons. He is thought to have split with his second wife Claudia after she insisted on sending their son Ben, who is now a football coach at Watford, to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Barnet, rather than a comprehensive school in Islington. They separated in 1999.Corbyn married for a third time in 2014 to his long-term partner Laura Alvarez, who is a Mexican fair trade coffee exporter.          Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks to demonstrators marching through London, duringJeremy Corbyn speech stuntEarlier this month, Jeremy Corbyn’s attempts to repair his relationship with the Jewish community backfired when he attempted to host a meeting at the Jewish museum in north London to address the Labour Party’s anti-semitism crisis.In what has been described as a stunt, the Jewish museum officials refused the request. Chief executive Abigail Morris said: ‘We would want to be part of a healing process, not something that will make things worse.’This comes after Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who is under investigation by the party after confronting the leader about anti-semitism, said: ‘This demonstrates the complete breakdown of trust between the leadership and the Jewish community.’ It was revealed that the Palestinian \u0027brothers\u0027 whose release was welcomed by Jeremy Corbyn included plotters whose bombs killed dozens and the killer of an Israeli girl of 15 and Dame Margaret said she had come to the conclusion that her party leadership may be anti-Semitic.It also emerged that Jeremy Corbyn organised an event in Parliament which ended up being addressed by a conspiracy theorist who believes the world is controlled by \u0027Jewish elders\u0027. Also, Momentum was in chaos after left-wingers criticised its decision to distance itself from Peter Willsman, the activist who was recorded ranting about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn plotSoon after this, Corbynistas threatened to deselect those moderate Labour MPs who have been plotting to oust Jeremy Corbyn: Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and Stephen Kinnock are thought to be among those who spent time at a Sussex farmhouse to discuss how to seize back the party.However, they faced a barrage of criticism online from far-left activists who are furious that the MPs are conspiring against the Labour leadership.Corbyn wreathThe Labour leader announced today that he would not be apologising for attending the wreath laying ceremony for Palestinian terrorists linked to the Munich 1972 massacre. Challenged about why he was there, he told Sky News: \u0027I was there when the wreaths were laid – that’s pretty obvious.\u0027There were many others there that were witness to that, I witnessed many other people laying many wreaths.’ When he was asked directly if he would heed demands by his own MPs to apologise, Mr Corbyn refused, saying: \u0027No, I’m not apologising for being there at all.\u0027After the pictures were released, he was condemned by the Israeli Prime Minister, relatives of the murdered athletes, Jewish groups and his own MPs.Jeremy Corbyn net worthJeremy Corbyn’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £3 million, according to Spears. Andrew Pierce for The Daily Mail also revealed that this is the figure that Corbyn has cost the UK and that he lives in a £650,000 house in London and when he was elected was paid £15,308, instead of £6,087.In 2003, MPs were paid £56,358 and workers an average of £18,525 but now, MPs are on £74,000 a year, almost three times the national average. Corbyn has pocketed £1.4 million in salary alone, having always taken Commons pay rises, despite public criticism.The average worker, by comparison, will have earned less than £500,000 in the same period. With expenses of more than double his salary, Corbyn has received more than £3 million from the taxpayer since he first became an MP.How to download Fortnite on AndroidWho are Michael Che and Colin Jost? 2018 Emmy hosts and SNL stars revealedThe 100 season 6: What we know so farWorld of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth: All you need to knowGeorge Ezra tour: All you need to know about the 2019 UK datesWho is Liu Yifei?

Lisa Marie Presley is seen second from right with daughter Riley Keough, and her twin girls who she had with Lockwood (far left) in October 2017Both Presley, 50, and Lockwood, 57, signed the post-nup a year after their January 2006 wedding when Presley was worth almost $63 million and Lockwood\u0027s net worth was zero.Lockwood, wants the document torn up, calling it invalid because, he claims, he was coerced into signing it, he didn\u0027t read it properly, his lawyer at the time - who has since died - didn\u0027t explain the agreement to him, and he doesn\u0027t remember the period when the post-nup was negotiated and signed.But Presley\u0027s attorney, Gary Fishbein, has fought back in court papers filed at LA Superior Court, accusing Lockwood of \u0027feigning amnesia or ignorance\u0027 and saying he \u0027had the full and complete opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement, was competently represented by counsel… and entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily, without duress or coercion.\u0027 On Monday, Presley took the witness stand  and accused Lockwood, of secretly running up \u0027possibly millions\u0027 on her credit card.\u0027I uncovered that he had been in control of finances for the 10 years before,\u0027 she told Judge Dianna Gould-Saltman at Los Angeles Superior on the first day of the expected four-day trial. \u0027He had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly millions on my credit card.\u0027 When Presley angrily confronted musician Lockwood in March 2016, three months before she filed for orce, he didn\u0027t deny running up the credit card bills, she said.And she insisted that he sign an agreement consenting to sell all his guitars, recording equipment, computers and other musical equipment to help make up for some of the credit card losses. \u0027It allowed me to pay off some of the Tennessee state taxes I owed,\u0027 she added.          Lisa Marie, daughter of music legend Elvis (pictured in 1970) allegedly asked her husband to sign a post-nup agreement \u0027to protect her assets and her inheritance\u0027Presley hired Lockwood for $3,500 a week as her musical director for her upcoming concert tour, in 2014 and married him two years later. In court Monday, she had trouble recalling the time of that marriage, her fourth.When Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Jeff Sturman asked her the date she got married she replied, \u0027I don\u0027t recall the date.\u0027 And when Sturman asked her, \u0027Do you remember what year?\u0027 she answered, \u0027I believe it was 2007.\u0027 In fact, she married Lockwood in Japan in January 2006. Presley told the court that before they married, she and Lockwood discussed having a pre-nup agreement but none was ever signed. Then, the year after they married, she asked him to sign a post-nup agreement \u0027to protect her assets and her inheritance.\u0027 \u0027He spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly...Aubrey O\u0027Day confided in Omarosa about her 2011 affair with...Share this articleTo support his argument that Lockwood voluntarily agreed to sign the post-nup twice - in July and November 2007 - Presley\u0027s lawyer Gary Fishbein asked her: \u0027Did he (Lockwood) express any objections to signing the pre-nuptial agreement? Did you hold a gun to his head? Did you threaten to leave him if he didn\u0027t sign?\u0027 Presley answered \u0027No\u0027 to all three questions. And when Fishbein asked her, \u0027Did he tell you that he never wanted anything from you,\u0027 she answered, \u0027Yes, he did.\u0027 When Fishbein asked her if the spousal support clause of the pre-nup - in which both she and Lockwood agreed not to seek spousal support from the other if they orced - was important to her, Presley said, \u0027Very.\u0027 Presley admitted that she did pay spousal support to her first husband, Danny Keough, when they orced but she added, with a chuckle, that she didn\u0027t have to pay support to husband number 2, Michael Jackson, or husband number 3, actor Nicholas Cage. Earlier in the day, giving his version of the couple\u0027s fight over the credit card in March 2016, Lockwood told the court that Presley \u0027was extremely upset. We were having an argument about a credit card.\u0027 He added that he agreed to sell all his musical equipment \u0027to appease her.\u0027 Asked by his lawyer, Sturman, why he signed the post-nup in 2007, Lockwood said: \u0027Because my wife wanted me to.\u0027 He said she became angry when he first hesitated to sign after his lawyer told him there were possible issues in the agreement that needed to be sorted out. But he signed anyway, he said. \u0027She\u0027s not a take-no-for-an-answer kind of woman,\u0027 he said of his soon-to-be-ex wife.Asked if he would like the court to find that the pre-nup agreement is invalid, he added, \u0027I believe it\u0027s something the court should decide.\u0027 Lockwood told the court that when he and Presley separated in June 2016, he had nowhere to go so he first stayed in a Holiday Inn, then \u0027couch-surfed\u0027 for about two years, and has been making around $2,000-$2,500 a month working as a store clerk, a factory worker, teaching guitar and playing guitar in session recordings. He said that he\u0027s now living with his girlfriend Stephanie to whom he\u0027s engaged to be married.The revelation prompted Presley\u0027s attorney to ask, \u0027Do you know that when you re-marry you would lose the spousal support from your previous marriage? Does that change your mind about getting married again?\u0027 Lockwood answered, \u0027I don\u0027t know about that.\u0027 Presley - who was in court in a black dress and beige coat and ankle boots - said she doesn\u0027t want to pay up and, countered Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman: \u0027She\u0027s feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027Earlier in his opening statement, Presley\u0027s lawyer Fishbein told Judge Gould-Saltman that he found it \u0027incredible and unbelievable\u0027 that Lockwood\u0027s \u0027position is that he didn\u0027t read the post-nuptial agreement - which he signed twice.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t need to have graduated from MIT to understand that you are waiving spousal support,\u0027 added Fishbein who also questioned Lockwood\u0027s contention that when he signed the post-nup, his attorney - now deceased - didn\u0027t explain it to him.\u0027This attorney had been practicing law since 1956 - he had more than 40 years experience in family law. \u0027Now Lockwood is trying to get out from under a agreement he voluntarily agreed to and signed. He wants a chunk of cash and a bunch of spousal support.\u0027 Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman hit back telling the court that Presley, her lawyers and business manager took an \u0027unfair advantage\u0027 of Lockwood when they persuaded him to sign the post-nup. \u0027They cooked the books - they wanted him to sign something they thought could be enforceable later on.\u0027 Despite the post-nup Sturman told the court, \u0027Spouses have a fiduciary (financial) duty to each other. \u0027Miss Presley is living off her inherited wealth….and Mr Lockwood has little or nothing. He is living at the poverty level. (Presley) is feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027 Lockwood - who wore a blue suit and tie and a black shirt in court Monday - told Fishbein under questioning that didn\u0027t remember signing the prenup. \u0027I don\u0027t really understand contracts,\u0027 he said, adding that he didn\u0027t find \u0027contracts and legalese interesting.\u0027 But, he continued: \u0027Had I read it I would not have signed it…I think it\u0027s unfair.\u0027 The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/15/01/4F191B5800000578-6061295-image-a-43_1534291531104.jpg","title":"A record number Romanian Bulgarians working UK summer","story":"    The Office for National Statistics says a total of 391,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria were employed in Britain between April and June this year (stock image)Before 2014, citizens of Romania and Bulgaria faced curbs on employment in Britain, although visas were granted to work in industries such as seasonal fruit picking.Now, immigration from the two countries shows no sign of slowing and the exodus is has been running at such a pitch that both of their home populations fell in 2016.Overall, there were 2.27 million EU citizens working in the UK from April to June – just over 7 per cent of a total workforce of 32.38 million.

Meghan Markle revealed her dreams about becoming a princess...Share this articleMarkle Sr said: \u0027I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: \u0027Daddy, I\u0027ve met a man… Daddy, he\u0027s English… Daddy, he\u0027s a prince.\u0027\u0027I thought it was a cute story.

But will passengers just see a blur of beige?A gaping white trumpet flares open at the bottom of the escalator at Liverpool Street station, ready to suck commuters into another dimension. The smooth concrete panels splay out to meet walls of faceted, enamelled steel, beneath a roof that zig-zags back and forth in angular waves, as if the whole space has been disturbed by whatever force lies beyond the great portal.It is a fittingly momentous entrance, given that this dilated Anish Kapoor-style orifice leads to the parallel universe of Crossrail. Deep below the streets of London, the £15.4bn infrastructure project has burrowed out a world of vast streamlined passages and immensely long platforms lit by digital displays, promising to whisk you from the City to Paddington in 10 minutes, or to the towers of Canary Wharf in just six.Wandering the cavernous passages of the central London stations for the first time, it is hard not to feel awed by the sheer size of it all. The trains will be 200 metres long, carrying up to 1,500 passengers – almost twice as many as an existing tube train – and the stations have been scaled up accordingly. Some, like Bond Street, are so big that their entrances bookend virtually an entire district. Reaching the trains entails being funnelled through pristine white passages, their walls stripped of the usual clutter of advertising, like the eerie corridors of Stanley Kubrick’s spaceship in 2001: A Space Odyssey.At the platforms you find a full-height wall of glass doors, with bands of digital displays, vents, speakers and a long ribbon of light, every function cleverly contained in one continuous surface that separates passengers from the tracks. No longer will you have to crane your neck to see the departure screen behind a dangling sign: there’s a live display above every door. It is a model of elegant efficiency, a galaxy apart from the creaking, sooty state of much of the 150-year-old London underground network, yet with familiar touches that make it feel like part of the same family.“We’ve looked back to go forward,” says Julian Robinson, Crossrail’s head of architecture, who cut his teeth on the Jubilee line extension as a junior architect in the early 90s and knows every inch of the tube. His team drew inspiration from the work of Charles Holden and Frank Pick in the 1930s, a golden age of London transport design that saw stations such as the flying saucer pavilion built at Southgate. Its uplighting columns inspired the freestanding “totems” that punctuate Crossrail’s passages, holding signage, speakers and CCTV, freeing the walls from the usual jumble of bolted-on bits.Elsewhere, the raw logic of the engineering has provided the aesthetic steer. The streamlined form of the intersecting corridors comes from the amorphous geometry of the sprayed-concrete tunnel lining, a different technique from the usual iron or concrete retaining rings that form right-angled corners, familiar to the rest of the underground. The smooth bends are helpful for crowd flow, something the designers have encouraged with sinuous lines between the concrete panels, creating “fast spaces” in the passages and “slow spaces” on the platforms, a psychological trick enhanced by cold and warm lighting.It is all impressively slick and precise, but the urge to banish clutter makes the platforms rather monotonous, sterile places. The relentless grid evokes being trapped in a computer model, and there’s none of the quirky character of some of the existing tube stops. The Technicolor Paolozzi mosaics of the Central line at Tottenham Court Road (a chunk of which were controversially removed by Crossrail works), or the deep indigo tiles of North Greenwich, make those stations easily identifiable at speed from a crowded carriage. The central stops on the Elizabeth line will be a continuous blur of beige.“There’s a tension between the line identity and the station identity,” admits Robinson, who says that the overarching idea was for the line-wide experience to be consistent, while the stations responded to their local context at street level. The western entrance to Tottenham Court Road station, designed by Hawkins Brown, is a dark place of black terrazzo with gold touches, in reference to the glitzy night-time economy of Soho. The concrete ceiling of Farringdon station, by Aedas, has a diamond-shaped structure, in a nod to the jewellers of Hatton Garden. The entrance to Woolwich, by Weston Williamson, features panels of bronze cladding in homage to the area’s former gun foundries. It looks in need of artillery, cowering at the foot of the new Berkeley Homes towers.Compared with the fluid drama of the tunnels, the stations all feel a bit meek as they surface. Rather than straining to be “contextual” with naff local allusions, why not deploy a strong Crossrail identity at street level – like the classic oxblood-red tiles of Leslie Green’s Piccadilly line stations built at the turn of the 20th century – and then vary the treatment on the platforms, so passengers know where they are from a glance through the window?The answer, as ever, can be found in the project’s cumbersome procurement process. While the Jubilee line extension, hailed for its architectural ambition, gave each architect responsibility for an entire station from entrance to platform, the scale and complexity of Crossrail led duties to be ided. The swooping white kit of standardised line-wide components was designed by Grimshaw Architects and engineering giant Atkins, while separate contractor-led teams were selected for the inidual stations’ ticket halls and street frontages, styled by a range of safe corporate firms, and mostly designed with a larger commercial building on top.Much of it is polite background architecture, with a tendency to make the extraordinary feel ordinary. Robinson’s tenets of exposed concrete elements and “self-finish” materials gives many of the stations a pleasingly raw heft, with square-coffered and origami-like folded ceilings, variously ribbed and moulded. But there is little of the oomph that you might expect from the grand scale of engineering, nothing like the atmospheric descent into Westminster station or the plunging blue glass wall of Southwark.Paddington offers a brief moment of wonder. A 90m-long void has been sliced into the street next to the Grade I-listed train shed, where escalators plunge down past gigantic concrete columns. In a first for the underground network, passengers will be able to stand on the platform and still see daylight 30m above. The scheme was originally designed by Will Alsop in the 90s, then taken over by John McAslan, and finally executed by Weston Williamson. The dilution is evident. To add some sparkle, the entrance has been topped with a huge glass canopy, etched with a cloud pattern by Spencer Finch, in one of the many artworks that adorn the line. Yayoi Kusama is installing some loops of polished steel balls outside Liverpool Street, while Conrad Shawcross is bringing one of his trademark bronze spirals. It’s hard not to think that the artistic effort would have been better invested in the architecture of the stations themselves.There was a moment, much earlier in the process, when the architects had a licence to dream more freely. Designs in the early 90s, by Ralph Erskine and BDP, depict cathedral-like spaces underground, reached by dramatic winding ramps. The entrance to Tottenham Court Road station was planned to take the form of a huge void in the shape of a beehive, plunging down from the middle of Soho Square, like the rotunda of New York’s Guggenheim museum, topped with glazed domes. Plans were delayed by economic recession and, by the time the Crossrail route was finally enacted by parliament in 2008, the tide had turned against such ambitious (and costly) ideas. The age of the icon was in decline.As the line moves further east, some architects nonetheless appear to have been given a looser rein, with mixed results. Whitechapel, still far from complete, will see an undulating green-roofed bridge by BDP, thankfully mostly hidden behind a retained Victorian facade. Norman Foster has made a big inflatable tubular greenhouse at Canary Wharf, but the station itself, by Adamson Associates, takes a less inspiring form than its rooftop jungle promises. At Abbey Wood, near the Thamesmead estate, Fereday Pollard has conjured a timber-framed, zinc-topped manta ray. Its airy ticket hall is a breath of fresh air, although from the outside it is unbearably clunky, floundering across the tracks like a beached whale.Beyond Whitechapel to the east and Paddington the the west, the route becomes the realm of Network Rail, over which Robinson’s team had little influence. The difference is profound. Ilford is to receive a gigantic grey-and-glass box, courtesy of Atkins, styled with all the finesse of an out-of-town storage depot. Ealing Broadway won’t fare much better, with a big canopy designed in the retail park vernacular by Bennetts Associates. Other outer London stations are set to be adorned with a similar assortment of canopies and boxes, along with occasional public space improvements to soften the blow. It speaks less of a magnificent new east-west link than the clutter of business-as-usual network improvements, a coughed hymn to value engineering.Transport bosses moan of the constraints on the total budget (already exceeded by £600m, it was recently announced) but some joined-up design thinking across the entire route could have lessened the feeling of a two-tier line. An opportunity to capture the value of this huge public investment was sorely missed. A recent report estimated that the total uplift in property values across the line could be as much as £10.6bn by 2021, soaring to £20.1bn by 2026, nearly a fourfold increase in the original estimates – all being siphoned into the pockets of private landowners.The Elizabeth line is an impressive achievement for sure, but with plans for Crossrail 2 now gathering momentum, there are some crucial lessons to be learned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16157b775686a725db82eeabbc5a45fd8348d1c6/0_136_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13b9ef88ad40ec21d9b803b9cec22be","title":"venice beach photos dotan saguy bohemian world in pictures","story":"After Disneyland, Venice Beach is the second largest tourist attraction in southern California and over a three-year period, photographer Dotan Saguy captured the artists, bodybuilders, musicians, vendors and homeless people who made up the erse community.

The low-profile senator, who entered parliament replacing a representative from the far-right One Nation party, refused to apologise for his comments, which were provocative enough to be condemned by the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson.Hanson told the Senate on Wednesday she was “appalled” by Anning’s comments, adding that the speech was “straight from Goebbels’s handbook from Nazi Germany”.The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the leader of the opposition, Bill Shorten, made a point of uniting in the federal parliament to decry Anning’s speech. The contribution was also condemned in the Senate by the major party leadership, by the Greens, who moved a censure motion against Anning, and a number of cross benchers, some of whom expressed regret for shaking Anning’s hand after the speech was delivered.Turnbull told parliament Australia was the most successful multicultural society in the world, and was “a migration nation”.He noted that Australia was continuing to maintain its multicultural identity “in a world where there is so much disharmony, where, in many places in the world, where people of different faiths and different races have lived side-by-side reasonably harmoniously for hundreds of years and now seem unable to do so”.“Despite all of that, here in Australia, in the midst of our ersity, we live in great harmony,” Turnbull said.The prime minister said the reference to the final solution in Anning’s speech on Tuesday night was a “shocking, shocking insult to the memory of over six million Jews who died in the Holocaust”.“We condemn that and the insult it offered to the memory of those Jewish martyrs, just as we condemn the racism, a shocking rejection of the Australian values that have made us the successful multicultural nation that we are today.”Turnbull said people who sought to demonise Muslims for the actions of a few “are helping the terrorists”.The Labor leader Bill Shorten said in the “corrosive and fragmented climate of public debate, it’s become unfortunately common for some to seek out attention by picking on minorities, the less powerful, by attacking in the most vile terms, normally someone who can’t defend themselves”. “Around the world, right-wing extremists are turning this into a political art form,” Shorten said.“They say something hateful or homophobic or sexist or racist, something designed to humiliate and denigrate and hurt, and then when their comments are condemned they complain about political correctness gone mad or the thought police stifling their free speech – all the while basking in the media attention.“I understand that in one sense there might be a reason to simply ignore it, to starve the stupidity of oxygen, to treat it as beneath contempt, but as leaders, as representatives of the Australian people, as servants of erse communities in a great multicultural nation, we cannot stay silent in the face of racism.“We cannot ignore the kind of prejudice and hate that the senator sought to unleash last night.”The prime minister and the opposition leader reached across the dispatch boxes in the parliament to shake hands after making their contributions.Many MPs were emotional during a debate that played out in both the House and the Senate. Government frontbencher Josh Frydenberg, who is Jewish, embraced his Labor friend, opposition frontbencher Ed Husic, a Muslim with Bosnian heritage, after Husic spoke in the chamber about the importance of finding common ground.Labor MP Anne Aly, the first Muslim woman to serve in the Australian parliament, said she was tired of trying to hold the line against vilification. “I’m tired of having to stand up against hate, against vilification, time and time and time again.”Aly said she was gratified by the response in the chambers. “This morning, I see hope. I see possibilities. I see opportunity. I see leaders on both sides who are willing to stand up and I see that I don’t have to fight alone anymore.“Thank you for that, thank you. It means a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0093bff69fb84d42574dd2e000bed725a03ab56d/0_244_4171_2504/master/4171.jpg?w=4000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5d6d5d8e5441fa6ea64ca012db6dbc1 8000w","title":"what heat proof city look like","story":"Cities are already up to 10C hotter than surrounding areas. As temperatures rise, here are four ways to cool cities down – saving both lives and energyIf you’ve felt uncomfortably hot in a city this summer, chances are it’s not just because of the weather. Look around any urban centre and you’ll see the built environment itself exacerbates summer temperatures.Vehicles stuck in traffic emitting heat. Airconditioners pumping waste heat into the air. Concrete and asphalt across almost every surface, absorbing and radiating the sun’s rays. Urban canyons formed between tall buildings, trapping heat at the street level.All these factors contribute towards a phenomenon called the “urban heat island” effect, which results in cities being up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside. How do we to tackle this?A typical response on a hot day might be to turn up the aircon. But this fuels a vicious circle of heating the outdoors to cool the indoors, making external spaces more uncomfortable still, and at a significant cost. Airconditioning currently accounts for around one-fifth of building-related global electricity usage, or 2.5 timesthe total electricity use in Africa.With a warming climate and rapid population growth in hotter, increasingly wealthy countries, our use of airconditioning is set to skyrocket in what the International Energy Agency calls a “looming cold crunch”. They estimate that the energy needed for cooling buildings will triple by 2050 – a growth equivalent to the current electricity demand in the USA and Germany combined.With the frequency and intensity of heatwaves increasing we need to urgently tackle the excess heat we face both inside our buildings, and in our cities’ outside spaces. Fortunately, there are many ways in which we can mitigate the urban heat island effect – while also creating more attractive places to live, work and play.As is obvious to anyone who has sat under a tree on a hot day, vegetation can be a powerful tool in the fight against excessive city heat. Not only does greenery provide shade, it stimulates evapotranspiration, the process by which water evaporating from plants’ leaves reduces the adjacent air temperature.Many cities recognise the value of parks and trees for urban cooling, not to mention residents’ psychological wellbeing, but few have embraced greenery to the extent of Singapore. The city-state embarked on its ambitious “garden city” plan in 1967 through intensive tree-planting and the creation of new parks. As the population grew and buildings got taller, the focus shifted to include skyrise greenery encompassing “skygardens”, vertical planting and green roofs.Today Singapore accommodates 100 hectares (240 acres) of skyrise greenery, with plans to increase this to 200 ha by 2030 – an area equivalent to Regent’s Park. This growth is fuelled by building regulations such as the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (Lush) policy. Lush requires any new building to include areas of greenery equivalent to the size of the development site. These can be at ground level or at height, and often include luxuriantly planted balconies, shaded skygardens and vertical green walls – which can help cause temperatures to drop by 2-3ºC.Many new buildings go far beyond the minimum required. The Oasia Hotel, designed by WOHA Architects, accommodates greenery across virtually every surface. Wrapped in a dramatic 200m-tall planted trellis, the building almost drips with vegetation, and is wildly at odds with the corporate steel and glass of many urban structures.If we are to make cities cooler we must also change the materials they’re built from. Urban areas are dominated by dark and hard materials – concrete, asphalt, paving – most of which absorb, rather than reflect, solar radiation. According to Australia’s Corporate Research Centre for Low Carbon Living, conventional paving can reach temperatures up to 67C and conventional roofs up to 50–90C on a hot day.Such temperatures can have significant health impacts. According to Arthur Rosenfeld of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, living on the top floor of a building with a dark roof was identified as a risk factor of mortality in the 1995 heatwave in Chicago. “Government has a role to ban or phase out the use of black or dark roofs, at least in warm climates, because they pose a large negative health risk,” he said.The best way to overcome this is to use cool coatings– typically lighter pigments in asphalt or white-coloured coatings applied to roads, roofs and facades, which reflect more solar energy away from the city.The New York Cools Roofs initiative, for example, has seen more than 500,000m² of roof space covered in a white reflective coating, saving an estimated 2,282 tonnes of CO2 per year from cooling emissions. Cool roofs are installed at no cost in public buildings, for non-profit organisations and in affordable housing. In other buildings free labour for installation is offered by the city with the owner just paying for the materials.It may sound simple, but the results can be significant – research by Nasa has suggested a white roof could be 5.5C (42ºF) cooler than a typical black roof on the hottest day of the New York summer.Water has been used as a tool to cool cities for centuries. The 14th century palace of Alhambra, for example, housed courtyards with pools and arching fountains, stimulating the evaporation of water and cooling the hot, dry Andalusian air.The contemporary heat-proof city could follow suit, accommodating ponds, pools, fountains, sprinklers and misting systems to cool outdoor spaces.Chongqing is known as one of the “three furnaces” of the Yangtze River Delta, given its long hot summers. To provide moments of relief, the city is experimenting by using water misters at local bus stops. These spray clouds of water chilled to 5-7C, cooling the air as well as the waiting passengers.One of the challenges in keeping the built environment cool is overreliance on fully-glazed facades. Many windows permit desirable natural light and views but can mean buildings trap unwanted heat in summer and don’t retain it in winter. We can easily design shading systems to protect buildings from the sun, but for the best possible results, these shading systems need to move in tune with the local weather and the path of the sun.A building management system operates 1,049 hexagon-shaped shades, opening and closing them like flowers. Their movements follow the sun, shading the parts of the building in direct sunlight but opening up to allow for natural light as the sun moves by.The result is a constantly changing and adapting façade, one that reflects daily and seasonal patterns of weather, climate and occupation and responds to changing needs of heat and light. Adaptable buildings and infrastructure like this one, which can morph to respond to different seasons and weather events, will be crucial in the future battle to keep cool and comfortable in a warming climate.

The shaming of overweight people has to stopWhen I saw the photograph I could scarcely believe it was the same country. A picture of Brighton beach in 1976, featured in the  a few weeks ago, appeared to show an alien race. Almost everyone was slim. I mentioned it on social media, then went on holiday. When I returned, I found that people were still debating it. The heated discussion prompted me to read more. How have we grown so far, so fast? To my astonishment, almost every explanation proposed in the thread turned out to be untrue.Unfortunately, there is no consistent obesity data in the United Kingdom before 1988, at which point the\u0026nbspincidence was already rising sharply. But in the United States, the figures go back further. They show that, by chance, the inflection point was more or less 1976. Suddenly, at around the time that the photograph was taken, people started becoming fatter – and the trend has continued ever since.The obvious explanation, many on social media insisted, is that we’re eating more. Several pointed out, not without justice, that food was generally disgusting in the 1970s. It was also more expensive. There were fewer fast food outlets and the shops shut earlier, ensuring that\u0026nbspif you missed your tea, you went hungry.So here’s the first big surprise: we ate more in 1976. According to government figures, we currently consume\u0026nbspan average of 2,130 kilocalories a day, a figure that appears to include sweets and alcohol. But in 1976, we consumed 2,280 kcal excluding alcohol and sweets, or\u0026nbsp2,590 kcal when they’re included. I have found no reason to disbelieve the figures.Others insisted that the cause is a decline in manual labour. Again, this seems to make sense, but again the data doesn’t support it. A paper last year in the International Journal of Surgery states that “adults working in unskilled manual professions are over four times more likely to be classified as morbidly obese compared with those in professional employment”.So how about voluntary exercise? Plenty of people argued that, as we drive rather than walk or cycle, are stuck to our screens and order our groceries online, we exercise far less than we did. It seems to make sense – so here comes the next surprise. According to a long-term study at Plymouth University, children’s physical activity is the same as it was 50 years ago. A paper in the International Journal of Epidemiology finds that, corrected for body size, there is no difference between the amount of calories burned by people in rich countries and those in poor ones, where subsistence agriculture remains the norm. It proposes that there is no relationship between physical activity and weight gain. Many other studies suggest that exercise, while crucial to other aspects of good health, is far less important than diet in regulating our weight. Some suggest it plays no role at all as the more we exercise, the\u0026nbsphungrier we become.Other people pointed to more obscure factors: adenovirus-36 infection, antibiotic use in childhood and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. While there is evidence suggesting they may all play a role, and while they could explain some of the variation in the weight gained by different people on similar diets, none appears powerful enough to explain the general trend.So what has happened? The light begins to dawn when you look at the nutrition figures in more detail. Yes, we ate more in 1976, but differently. Today, we buy half as much fresh milk per person, but five times more yoghurt, three times more ice cream and – wait for it – 39 times as many dairy desserts. We buy half as many eggs as in 1976, but a third more breakfast cereals and twice the cereal snacks half the total potatoes, but three times the crisps. While our direct purchases of sugar have sharply declined, the sugar we consume in drinks and confectionery is likely to have rocketed (there are purchase numbers only from 1992, at which point they were rising rapidly. Perhaps, as we consumed just 9kcal a day in the form of drinks in 1976, no one thought the numbers were worth collecting.) In other words, the opportunities to load our food with sugar have boomed. As some experts have long proposed, this seems to be the issue. The shift has not happened by accident. As Jacques Peretti argued in his film The Men Who Made Us Fat, food companies have invested heavily in designing products that use sugar to bypass our natural appetite control mechanisms, and in packaging and promoting these products to break down what remains of our defences, including through the use of subliminal scents. They employ an army of food scientists and psychologists to trick us into eating more than we need, while their advertisers use the latest findings in neuroscience to overcome our resistance.They hire biddable scientists and thinktanks to confuse us about the causes of obesity. Above all, just as the tobacco companies did with smoking, they promote the idea that weight is a question of “personal responsibility”. After spending billions on overriding our willpower, they blame us for failing to exercise it.To judge by the debate the 1976 photograph triggered, it works. “There are no excuses. Take responsibility for your own lives, people!” “No one force feeds you junk food, it’s personal choice. We’re not lemmings.” “Sometimes I think having free healthcare is a mistake. It’s everyone’s right to be lazy and fat because there is a sense of entitlement about getting fixed.” The thrill of disapproval chimes disastrously with industry propaganda. We delight in blaming the victims.Perhaps this is because obesophobia is often a fatly-disguised form of snobbery. In most rich nations, obesity rates are much higher at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale. They correlate strongly with inequality, which helps to explain why the UK’s incidence is greater than in most European and OECD nations. The scientific literature shows how the lower spending power, stress, anxiety and depression associated with low social status makes people more vulnerable to bad diets.Just as jobless people are blamed for structural unemployment, and indebted people are blamed for impossible housing costs, fat people are blamed for a societal problem. But yes, willpower needs to be exercised – by governments. Yes, we need personal responsibility – on the part of policymakers. And yes, control needs to be exerted – over those who have discovered our weaknesses and ruthlessly exploit them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8356a6fcd1d0d81e254066213a50012ba13c30f6/0_1100_2911_1747/master/2911.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00257703e866072d1eb7f009347680d8","title":"humanist weddings marriage civil ceremonies religious","story":"Planning our civil ceremony was as special as filling in a tax return. There was little magic in the photocopied wedding booklet, on cheap blue paper, with options to circle like a hospital menu. The song we picked was rejected because it said “God” in it, so we had to find something else. When standing in front of 100 friends and family, being married by someone with all the zeal of a headmaster giving out a punishment exercise, I started to have my doubts about weddings.A year later, as a priest called my friend a different name three times and the magic of the occasion evaporated, I had my epiphany: I am a wedding-hater. After a decade of being a guest and once as a bride, I’ve concluded that traditional ceremonies have no redeeming qualities. They’re impersonal, stuffy and one of the most egregiously dismal-yet-tolerated parts of British life, along with iceberg lettuce, bingo halls and public loos.Organised religion is out of step with a modern Scotland. Sectarianism is alive here and continues to cast a long shadow. For that reason, religion is synonymous with violence and intolerance for many, and at odds with our values as a nation. We have a strong desire to uphold human rights and believe wholeheartedly in marriage equality – something most churches are noticeably equivocal on. Default Christianity is over, with more people valuing their identity as an inidual over their faith. For more than a decade we’ve had a secular alternative that reflects the ersity of Scotland’s people. Of course more people are choosing humanism.But I’m not convinced that this is the only reason that humanist ceremonies are outstripping religious and civil services. These numbers reflect a broader change in social attitudes. Getting married doesn’t mean the same thing it meant a generation ago. It is no longer the thing that you have to do to please your parents or to be accepted in society, which removes much of the pressure to conform. Marriage is an option, not an obligation, and today orce carries little stigma. I’m sure few think they’re imperilling their mortal soul when they open their decree absolute. I certainly didn’t.On a subconscious level at least, marriage is no longer viewed as until-death-do-us-part, so doing it in a place of worship where that’s the subtext would be disingenuous. I’ll confess to being unromantic enough to have considered the statistical probability of failure before I said “I do” the first time.The value people place on marriage has changed. It isn’t the first step in a life together or the necessary precursor to starting a family it’s just a piece of paper that comes when you’re sure you’ve got what it takes to make a life together. That’s why humanist ceremonies are so appealing – they don’t automatically treat marriage as the beginning of something, but as a point on the journey people make together. There are no rules, no judgement, no photocopied menus with a limited set of options.My partner and I are getting married next year. We were both struck by how person-centred and meaningful a humanist funeral was, and so we’ve chosen a humanist elopement. Craving something simple, personal, free of bureaucracy, formality and religious overtures, it was the obvious choice. There will be no pleasing other people, no pre-marriage classes, no laws to acknowledge. Just two godless heathens in love with the desire to be our uncensored selves. As more discover how liberating it is to do their own thing, the numbers will only rise.• Vonny LeClerc is an arts journalist and social activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca5c2405820fb6acbb5cbce89fce0daeb611e4c/0_38_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b158fc97f3f64fa52752047f5c6153","title":"madonna 60 woman quiet pop singer critics","story":"The pop singer turns 60 this week – and she is still defying the critics who tell older women to ‘gracefully’ fade awayIs Madonna dead?” my daughter asked recently, while we danced like idiots in the kitchen to Vogue. Having spent a good few months inculcating my child with Madonna’s back catalogue, I realised I’d told her nothing about the woman herself. My daughter is still young enough to have no interest in the age of the singers she listens to – living or dead is generally enough information for her. If only we all felt that way.Pop music is an unforgiving place for the older woman. Few know this better than Madonna, who turns 60 on Thursday, and whose every move in the past 15 years has been accompanied by a grim chorus of “Put it away, grandma”. That the entertainment industry is among the worst culprits when it comes to fading out women – note in comparison the scores of male actors and musicians carrying on into their 60s\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp70s unimpeded – is especially depressing since it’s a business that directly influences how we think and live. But we can take heart that, as with so many aspects of the female experience, Madonna is doing her\u0026nbspdamnedest to put it right.“Do not age, to age is a sin,” she said in a blunt speech in 2016, after accepting an award at Billboard’s Women in Music event. “You will be criticised, you will be vilified and you will definitely not be played on the radio.” But being criticised and vilified is all in a day’s work for Madonna. So is adjusting expectations and redrawing boundaries, all the while pleasing herself. These are the things she does best. She hasn’t so much smoothed the path for those who have come after her as hacked her way through the undergrowth, and done battle with monsters, in order to make it walkable for the rest of us.Madonna has been in my life for pretty much as long as I can remember. I have watched her in her various incarnations – gobby, rosary-draped urchin, corset-clad dominatrix, wayward cowgirl, hot yoga mom – with a mixture of curiosity, amusement and awe. As well as her successes, I have observed her failures and humiliations, and admired how she ploughs on regardless, doing what she wants and never apologising, even though her pain is clear. Having had her in my peripheral vision for 35 years, I now look on her like one would an unusually free-spirited relative: unpredictable, occasionally misguided, frequently inspiring, forever up for new adventure. That so many people, from Mary Whitehouse to the pope to Piers Morgan, have wished her to be quiet, or invisible, has made her all the more compelling. Rubbing people up the wrong way is one of her many talents.You might have thought that all these years in Madonna’s company would have rendered the world impervious to her antics – yet her transgressions apparently continue. Now her mere existence as a woman (almost) in her 60s means, for some, that she has outlived her usefulness. At her age, she should be quiet and amenable. She should stay at home,\u0026nbspcut her hair short and keep her upper arms covered. And those hands! “Why do Madonna’s hands look older than her face?” inquired the Daily Mail in 2006 in a particularly venal piece that has been redrafted pretty much every year since.But this is Madonna. She doesn’t do quiet and she doesn’t do amenable. In the face of criticism, she reacts. Well, why wouldn’t she? When she is told that she should slow down, step back and act her age, she protests in the only way that she knows: in the public gaze. So she does a topless photoshoot – rather beautiful, as it happens – in Interview magazine. She gets her arse out at the Met Gala, essentially pulling a massive moony at the world. This month, she put on suspenders for a Vogue photoshoot. You can just imagine her assembling her outfit with her team: “So guys, what can I wear that will given Elton a bloody hernia?” That’s our girl. So all hail to Our Lady, still fighting, still hacking away at the undergrowth, still clearing a path and changing the world for the rest of us.• Fiona Sturges is a freelance arts writer specialising in books, music, podcasting and TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023275c832d4dc07c781f397ab5a92c50a4bfe50/0_8_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dbbcf07a3440ccc0910b84f17e9c548","title":"spuds youll like 20 delicious recipes to help save the humble potato","story":"In the UK, potatoes don’t even count as one of your five a day – so you can’t offset the guilt of eating them with the thought that you are adding to the vegetable tally.

If you’ve got a bit more time, once the potatoes are cooked, scoop out the flesh and mix it with blue cheese, some walnuts, spinach or chard, put it back into the potato and warm it up with a bit of extra butter and some herbs – chervil, tarragon or basil work well. Top with pine nuts, walnuts or fried almonds.Yotam Ottolenghi, chefA lot of potatoes can be quite bland. You almost want to taste the soil. That is reminiscent of a Jersey Royal, and the reason you can taste the soil in Jersey Royals is because they fertilise with seaweed. So, I took that idea and thought: “Why don’t we serve potatoes with seaweed?” You can get dried seaweed from the Cornish Seaweed Company. We use that. Put some seaweed in the water as you boil potatoes. Make a seaweed butter and dress the cooked potatoes with it.Josh Eggleton, chef proprietor at The Pony and Trap Make five or six incisions through a potato. Stop each incision a centimetre or two before the base. Give the potato a little squeeze to open it up. Dress the potato. Use rapeseed oil and fresh garlic, rosemary, sea salt and black pepper, or spice it up with turmeric and a bit of oil or any nice herby or aromatic spice. Cook for 30-35 mins at 170-180C.Zoe Adjonyoh, founder of Zoe’s Ghana KitchenUse equal quantities of flour and salt and add enough water to make a dough. You could add thyme or rosemary, too. Roll out to about 1.5cm thick. Wrap the potato or potatoes in the dough, then bake in the oven. I like maris pipers, something a bit floury. We do smaller ones for about 25 minutes at 180C. A larger one will need 30-35 mins. Break the crust open, take the potatoes out and away you go. Quarter a hard boiled egg into it, or a tin of tuna. The aroma when you crack it open is amazing.Sean Kelly, head chef at the Lovat Loch NessMy first job was in the potato section at the Royal Garden hotel in Kensington. For this, I use equal amounts of potato and pumpkin (or butternut squash). Peel and slice very thinly, on a mandolin if you have one. You are going to layer alternately, so it will be orange and white all the way down. Put some clarified butter into a round-bottomed casserole, then a sheet of greaseproof paper, and on top of that a bit more clarified butter, salt and a crack of black pepper. Arrange a layer of potato slices: almost as a whole flower, all overlapping, like a pretty picture. Then a layer of pumpkin, then a layer of potato, and so on. Season it with truffle or thyme or rosemary. Then bake it in the oven at 180C for half an hour. Turn it out onto a plate. It’s a showstopper.Aiden Byrne, chef director at 20 Stories in ManchesterThe potato here – floury, not waxy – replaces rice. Sweat two banana shallots on a low heat in a heaped tablespoon of butter and a splash of olive oil for about 10 minutes. Add 450g peeled potatoes, chopped into very small cubes or grated on the coarsest side of the grater. Stir the spuds to coat in the butter and shallot mixture and add a sprig of thyme. You could add 3tbsp of white wine and stir until this is absorbed or you could go straight to the stock. You will need about 600ml liquid in total. Add in large ladelfuls. Stir occasionally, letting this absorb into the potatoes before adding the next lot. This will take about 10-15 mins on a medium heat, by which time the potatoes should be cooked and creamy while still holding their shape. Add parmesan, chopped parsley and season to your liking.Rosie Sykes, freelance chef and menu consultantKeep it simple. Get some new potatoes – there are good mids at the moment – and stick them in the oven with some olive oil to roast. At the last minute, add some chicory and capers, or small tomatoes.Jane Baxter, chef and food writerWe don’t use much potato in Thai cuisine. The traditional recipe is massaman curry. I love the flavours so much. I was thinking to use this recipe in Masterchef but I didn’t have a chance. Make massaman curry, but instead of using lots of coconut milk, make it quite dry. Dice the potato smaller than usual so it absorbs all the flavours. Reduce the mixture for a couple of hours and treat it as a pie mix, with a crispy crust on top.Nawamin Pinpathomrat, MasterChef 2018 finalist, host of Patara Soho supper club I love potatoes in this restorative Portuguese stew. The ingredients are olive oil, onions, garlic, stock, smoked paprika (very important), kale or similar, some form of white bean and potatoes. The potatoes are the main event as they soak up all of the flavour. It’s so simple, cheap and quick to make.The potatoes, stock and paprika together make A very restorative meal. It tastes – both incredibly satisfying and healthy: the ideal comfort food.Morvah, LondonA quick and easy snack, crispy but soft in the middle. Simply grate a couple of potatoes, add melted butter, salt and pepper and paprika if you wish. You also add grated cheese. Fry off in small batches or one big rosti.Mohammad Shakir, LondonI came across a mention of these years ago in The Gentle Art of Cookery, a delightful book by CF Leyel and Olga Hartley, published in 1925. I am still none the wiser as to who Franklin was, but I suspect there may be an American influence. It is basically layers of parboiled potatoes cooked with bread sauce and topped with breadcrumbs. It may sound a bit weird, but the bread sauce is creamy and infused with onion, garlic, pepper. The whole thing tastes even better the next day. It’s comfort food of the stodgiest, yet most satisfying order.Rachel Kelly, LondonPotato pancakes are easy to make. I blend corn starch, onion and some mashed potatoes, shape and then fry like a normal pancake. You can add other veg, such as leaf greens, corn or broccoli, and pair them with whatever you like. I have mine with baked chicken or salmon, or with egg and cheese for breakfast.Krithika, SouthamptonHere’s a traditional Polish recipe for potato cakes: peel the potatoes (12kg) and finely grate them. Add wheat flour (12 tbsp) and a 14 of a finely grated onion mix in an egg and a pinch of salt. Fry on a medium heat for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. They’re so versatile – you can have them on their own (sprinkle with sea salt), or try adding mushroom sauce, goulash, Hungarian lecsó or any other vegetable stew. They also go well with soured cream or can even be eaten with a dusting of sugar.Mariusz Makarski, BrightonThe perfect side dish. The potatoes are boiled in salted water for several minutes. They are then rubbed dry and oven-roasted in olive oil until golden brown. Coat in a reduced tomato-based sauce made from six tomatoes, chopped with the skin removed, 1tsp vinegar, sugar, garlic, 1tsp smoked paprika and salt.Allan Michael, EssexA German friend living in Brittany showed me a “grate” way to cook apples and potatoes – pop the largest skillet you have on to a hot stove, grate the potatoes and the apple, melt butter on to the skillet and then add the fruit and veg. Leave till golden brown on one side, then flip and repeat. The grated potato benefits from having some of its moisture squeezed out before going into the skillet, and the result is crispy and golden.Simon, BristolToss any green salad you like, boil good-quality potatoes until done and add to the leaves right away. Douse liberally with your favourite vinaigrette dressing (maple-balsamic is really good). Toss together – and eat immediately. The hot potatoes soak up the vinaigrette, and the contrast with the crisp, fresh salad vegetables is great.Deirdre, Edinburgh This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But yes, Dedryck would have been fit to play.“He has been with us on the journey now for a couple of years and helped us get to this position and someone of his quality, a World Cup semi-finalist in our team, certainly would have helped.”Celtic now face a Europa League play-off when they will play the Latvian side Spartaks Jurmala or Suduva from Lithuania, a huge blow for the club who will miss out on the prestige – not to mention the vast sums of money – to be earned in the Champions League.Within six minutes Celtic were trailing to a Galo strike and it looked a forlorn task for the visitors when the Croatian striker Livaja headed in a second five minutes after the break.Rodgers was critical of his side’s defending. “We conceded a soft goal against Livingston and Alashkert and against Hearts we gave away a goal,” he said. “We are not getting opened up and fantastic goals scored against us, it is concentration and basic defending. But we will go away and work with the players we have, try to improve and make them better.Sinclair, on as a substitute, pulled a goal back in the 78th minute but despite a grand finale the Scottish champions could not fashion a second that would have put them through on away goals.The 70,000-capacity stadium was around half-full but the home fans roared when Niklas Hult, at the second attempt, got his cross past Mikael Lustig to the midfielder Galo, who swept it past Craig Gordon from 12 yards.Celtic almost conceded a second soon after when Viktor Klonaridis, who scored in the first leg last week, burst into the box but toe-poked a shot wide.Having taken the lead, however, AEK Athens sat back and Celtic took control with Tom Rogic and Leigh Griffiths having efforts on goal before the latter sent a fine Callum McGregor cross inches past the post from eight yards out.Jack Hendry headed a Griffiths corner over the bar just before the interval but any positivity Celtic’s response elicited evaporated early in the second half when Galo’s free-kick to the back post was headed back across goal by Vassilis Lampropoulos for Livaja to head past Gordon.Celtic responded positively again and only a brilliant save by Vassilis Barkas prevented Simunovic’s header from a Kieran Tierney cross speeding in at the near post.Rodgers brought on Moussa Dembélé for Lustig in the 59th minute but Klonaridis missed a great chance to make it 3-0.Celtic kept piling forward and minutes after Sinclair came on for Rogic he gave them hope when he headed in a Tierney cross.But the home side held out in the nervy final minutes, despite Simunovic coming close with a flick in the last of five added minutes.Benfica’s 2-1 aggregate win over Fenerbahce means Liverpool still face the prospect of a tough draw. Benfica take on the Greek side PAOK Salonika, who have already knocked out FC Basel and Spartak Moscow to progress to the play-off round, for a place in the competition proper.The result means Liverpool, the highest-ranked third seeds, could find themselves in Pot 3, rather than the more favourable Pot 2, for the group stage draw that takes place on 30 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f12a36971810e2ee7d8fea32be1f5f204eaefe7/0_253_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abfb5c9e5ac4e4d420974c78826d4d74","title":"hottest match england football knowledge","story":"Plus: players with comic-book nicknames, successive suffix fixtures and the least deserving champions in football history“What is the hottest English league or cup game on record?” asks Mike Dunn.“In our era of climate change, the answer is probably last week, but I think I know the game that was most affected,” perspires Andy Wright, before letting us in on a remarkable saga of woe. “Bizarrely, it took place in Manchester. “On 1 September 1906, in City’s first game of the season (home to Woolwich Arsenal), the temperature was reported as being ‘over 90F in the shade and too hot for sunbathing’. How much above 90F is anyone’s guess, but even that is 32.2C in today’s money. “On 35 mins, City’s Irvine Thornley left the pitch due to sunstroke. Before half time, he was joined by teammate Jimmy Conlin, who had started the game with a handkerchief tied on his head. City began the second half 0-2 down and with nine men, but in the 50th minute Conlin, plus handkerchief, returned to set up George Dorsett to make it 1-2. That was as good as it got for City, and before long they were reduced to eight men, losing their scorer and Bob Grieve to heat exhaustion.“The ref consulted his linesmen, but they agreed there was no just cause for abandoning the game. Woolwich scored two more to win 1-4, by which time City’s Tommy Kelso and James Buchan had also retired, so they finished the game with five fit men and the plucky Conlin. The Daily Mail reported that Arsenal were clearly the fitter and better-prepared team, and chose not to take advantage of their opponents’ misfortune.”“Was discussing Yerry Mina with a friend and we ended up talking about players who were named after cartoon or comic characters. The only others we could come up with were Hulk and Kun (Agüero). There surely must be more. Can you help?” writes Kesavan Mukunthan.Funnily enough a previous Knowledge “Can you help?” section, from August 2011, provides part of an answer here. At the time a certain Milos pointed out that Dragan “Piksi” Stojkovic, the Yugoslavia legend, received his nickname from a cartoon mouse in Pixie and Dixie. But Milos was looking for further examples – and no one else appears to have stepped up to the plate.This season, Tranmere Rovers return to contest League Two alongside eight teams with the suffix Town, including six successive fixtures against these clubs over the new tear,” tweets Kieho Várzea Ma’a. “What is the record for successive fixtures versus clubs with the same (or no) prefix or suffix?” The winner here appears to Leicester, who seven years before their title win pulled off another minor miracle by playing seven different Uniteds in a row – Colchester, Peterborough, Carlisle, Hereford, Leeds, Southend and Scunthorpe – at the back end of the 2008-09 League One title-winning season. Robert Hickman has another worthy entry. “In 1920-21, Notts County, Leyton Orient and Fulham played seven teams with the suffix City in a row,” he tells us. The Leyton Orient and Fulham chains stretch over the end of one season and into the next, so only Notts County really satisfies the question. However, the scheduling in these years involved a lot of back-to-back matches and so is cheating a bit.“More recently Chesterfield played six different teams with the suffix City in a row in 1950-51, and, even more bizarrely, Carlisle United played five other different Uniteds at the start of the 1988-89 Fourth Division season.”“The Washington Valor arena football team just won their league’s championship, having finished bottom of the table with a record of won two, lost 10 – but still qualifying for the end-of-season play-offs in which they triumphed,” reports Kyle Hill. “Their final record was four won, 11 lost. In that spirit, what’s the worst football club to ever end up as champions (or just promoted)?”Michael Peters has a worthy proposal for this one. “I’d humbly like to submit POSCO Atoms, South Korean champions of 1986,” he writes. “The six-team league was played in two round robin stages, with the winners of each stage meeting in a two-leg play-off to decide the overall champions. POSCO won the first stage (P10 W3 D6 L1 F9 A5) and came fifth in the second stage (P10 W2 D2 L6 F9 A18). They then beat Lucky-Goldstar Hwangso 2-1 over two legs to win the league on a record of P22 W6 D9 L7 F20 A24.”We can’t find anything comparably awful although, for a cracking read on a similar topic, we recommend this Rob Smyth Joy of Six from 2009 on the worst football champions. “Plenty of teams have a City or Town suffix, but is a there a Village?” asked Philip Genochio on 17 March 2010. “And if so, what’s the highest level they’ve played at?”There are plenty of Villages, though there’s a good reason why Philip hadn’t heard of any: they’re all tremendously obscure, or tremendously foreign. There’s Park Street Village, who used to play in the Herts Senior County League. The Mid Sussex League features three Villages: Maresfield, Franklands and Handcross. In the same county, Pease Pottage Village play in the Sussex County League Division Three.The best Village team in Wales, so far as we can tell, is Llansantffraid Village of the Mid Wales League. Trefnant Village played in the Clwyd League until a couple of years ago, when they stopped. A team called Garden Village in Swansea don’t count, because “that’s not suffixed, it’s the actual name of the place”, according to Lee Davies. The same ruling would exclude North Village Rams of the Bermudian Premier Division. Other Caribbean Villages include Village Superstars of the St Kitts-Nevis Premier Division, and Village United of the Jamaican National Premier League.As for the foreign villages, linguists will know that dorf means village in German, making Fortuna Düsseldorf, currently in the Bundesliga 2 but champions in 1933, comfortably our finest village outfit. “Although,” as Alex Cunningham writes, “585,000 inhabitants does make it a largish village.” Düsseldorf probably falls foul of the Garden Village ruling, as does the Israeli side Hapoel Kfar Saba (Kfar Saba meaning “grandfather’s village”).In Turkish, köy means village. A team called Siirt YSE was renamed Siirt Köy Hizmetleri Spor in 1989, before becoming Siirt Jetpa and, after they were relegated and their owner arrested for fraud, Siirtspor in 2002. An ex-Village, then.Finally, “I don’t know if this counts, but I played as a teenager in the early 60s for a team called Onslow Village, which is part of Guildford off the Farnham Road,” says Andrew Jackson. “They played, I think, in the Surrey Intermediate League. A quick bit of Googling shows there currently to be a team called Onslow FC.” “In the Paraguayan league, David Mendieta of Independiente scored a goal against Sol de América assisted by David Mendieta,” says Juan Pablo Zaracho. “Are there any other players who have scored after receiving an assist by a teammate with the same first and last name?”“I noticed that Vincent, Sébastien and Oliver Thill have all scored a goal for Luxembourg and was wondering what the record is for the amount of siblings who have scored for their country?” ponders Simon Hurst. “Their father, Serge Thill, also played for the national team but was unable to register a goal.”“Of the 22 players starting the Newcastle v Tottenham game, every one was with their club last season,” notes Phil Boyle. “How long is it since that has happened in a first game of the season, and has it ever happened in the Premier League era? The only signing starting was Martin Dubravka, who converted his loan to a permanent deal.”“With only nine of the 20 teams in Premier League this season coming from north of Watford Gap, is this the most southern-dominated top flight ever?” asks Ian Brailsford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3949bba4c0a0dac09767b5cc818d2b2ea48c9dd6/0_52_2147_1288/master/2147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a5358aa29ccc3cdfe12f5d4e372463","title":"not weekend for premier league underdog football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Archie Rhind-Tutt and Mark Langdon to review the first Premier League weekend of the season, Liverpool’s impressive start, same old Arsenal (or is it?), Luke Shaw’s release from wherever José Mourinho was hiding him and a foul from BurundiRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

It came a day before the announcement of what was expected to be another round of high annual fare rises.Since 2008, rail fares have increased at double the rate of wages.The RPI figure is used to set the maximum increase in regulated fares – which account for about half of all tickets sold – including commuter season tickets, some off-peak long distance returns and “anytime” tickets in major cities.In a letter to the RMT, Aslef, Unite and TSSA unions, Grayling said he shared the desire for lower ticket prices, but added: “As you will be aware, one of the industry’s largest costs is pay.”He said the use of RPI was “difficult to justify”, and asked the RDG to move to theCPI figure in future.Unions, which planned to stage protests at stations across the country on Wednesday to mark the latest fare increase, blamed privatisation for escalating rail costs.Mick Cash, the RMT’s general secretary, said: “If Chris Grayling seriously thinks that rail staff are going to pay the price for his rank incompetence and the greed of the private train operating companies then he needs to think again.”The RMT and others have renewed their calls for rail to return to public ownership after research suggested fares had increased at more than double the rate of wages over the last decade.Grayling’s suggestion to unions comes in a year when passengers havd suffered months of cancellations and delays after the May timetable fiasco.The TUC said the private firms running the trains paid at least £165m in idends to their shareholders last year, when overall taxpayer subsidy to the rail industry reached £3.5bn.Steve Chambers, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “We’re calling for a rail fares freeze in January and for a move to CPI from 2020. Fare rises are out of step with household budgets and wages.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868c7e0d70db2862c274688e7fac1412f64d9cee/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66fe51d31fd15ecfdb2ec961d0eff970","title":"directline flights iberia codeshare","story":"We lost £255 and half a day stay but Directline Flights refuses to payI booked two airline tickets with Directline Flights to give my 84-year-old mother a Mother’s Day treat in Rome. The information stated that our flight was with Iberia and that it “offered a traditional airport check-in service”. We reached Gatwick an hour and 20 minutes before departure after some delays on the way. The Iberia check-in desk was crowded and only staffed by one person. After a long wait in a queue, I was told that we had to go to the Vueling check-in because the flight was a “codeshare”. When we got there, we were told it had just closed and I would have to buy tickets for a later flight. I did so, losing £255 and half a day of our three-day stay. Directline Flights has refused to admit it gave the wrong information. CW, London“Codeshare” flights are a business agreement whereby one airline can market and sell tickets under its brand for a flight operated by another carrier. It’s crucial, therefore, that passengers are told which airline is operating the flight and where they should check in.The question is, who is to blame? Directline, in its response to you, says such information was the responsibility of Jetset, a trade-only tour operator which supplies content for Directline’s booking platform, and it blames Gatwick for not displaying flights as “codeshare”.Jetset insists that it did provide the relevant “codeshare” information and that it’s up to Directline what it does with it. Gatwick, meanwhile, says it makes clear which flights are “codeshare” on its departure boards but you, of course, were only looking at check-in screens.Both Jetset and Directline try to shift the blame on to you for not arriving two hours ahead as advised – Directline even goes so far as to check the traffic reports on the day you travelled to undermine your claim you were delayed on the road.“Had the passengers arrived at Gatwick two hours before departure, as advised, there would have been some minor inconvenience of being asked to move check-in desk, but the flight would have been comfortably made,” it says, blithely ignoring the amount of time you’d still have wasted queuing at the wrong desk.The fact is, you were misled as to where you should check in and that’s unacceptable.ABTA offered to mediate because Jetset is a member, but it has dropped the investigation because, it concluded, the buck seems to stop with Directline, which is not.Your plight shows the pitfalls of booking through third-party price comparison websites.

Confirmation of the planned 2019 rise came with the publication of July’s inflation figures by the Office of National Statistics. Rises to regulated fares, which include season tickets and off-peak returns, are capped at the level of RPI inflation – a measure that is not habitually used and is higher than CPI. Studies have repeatedly found weekday commuter fares to be significantly higher in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.\u0026nbspAccording to a TUC analysis, season ticket fares on city commuter routes can be up to six times more expensive than in France, Germany, Italy or Spain.\u0026nbspHowever, UK rail services have been faster and more frequent on routes they compared. Broadly, peak intercity fares also tend to be much more expensive in the UK but advance, off-peak tickets can be much cheaper than abroad.\u0026nbspOff-peak fares bought on the day are similar - but UK tickets are often the same price for a return as a single: an anomaly that means British single fares are typically more expensive, yet returns cheaper than European equivalents.\u0026nbspThe transport secretary, Chris Grayling, infuriated unions by suggesting rail fare increases could be pegged to the lower measure of inflation if unions accept the same measure for staff pay. In a letter to the RMT, Aslef, Unite and TSSA unions, Grayling said: “As you will be aware, one of the industry’s largest costs is pay … it is important that pay agreements also use CPI and not RPI in future when it comes to basing pay deals on inflation.”Unions blame privatisation for escalating rail costs. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said: “If Chris Grayling seriously thinks that rail staff are going to pay the price for his rank incompetence and the greed of the private train operating companies then he needs to think again.”Grayling defended his proposal in BBC interviews on Wednesday morning as “entirely fair”, said he was “very disappointed” at the reaction from the unions. He said: “My challenge to the unions is let’s get the routine increases down to the lower level of inflation.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said Grayling’s “attack on staff pay is, at best, a distraction technique and at wo a recipe for years of industrial action”.The RMT staged small protests at stations across the country on Wednesday morning against fare rises, claiming passengers were paying “more for less” as job cuts meant fewer staff working on trains, stations and ticket offices. Commuters at Kings Cross station in London were dismayed at the news of further fare rises. Lydia Bolton, 35, of Royston, Hertfordshire, who works part-time in the charity sector and pays £32 a day to travel to work, said: “It’s awful. We don’t know if we’re going to get a pay rise, we’ve got a young child and we have nursery costs. Of course they should freeze fares – it’s insane.”Philip Doyle, 46, pays almost £300 a month to commute in from Potters Bar, Herts, to work in recruitment. “Fares are ridiculous, and the service is a shambles. Last Sunday we went away as a family and when we came back to London there was only one train running in three hours, instead of every 20 minutes on the timetable.”Rosie Jones, 29, a marketing manager, pays £5,284 for an annual season ticket from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, said the service had recovered since the chaos of May but evening cancellations still often left her waiting at stations or standing on crowded trains: “It doesn’t seem like there’s any added value for the extra money, and it seems out of step with other costs.” The RPI figure is used to set the maximum increase in regulated fares, which account for around half of all tickets sold – including commuter season tickets, some off-peak long-distance returns, and “anytime” tickets in major cities. The increased revenue is factored in to rail franchise contracts – although the government says it is up to operators whether they choose to raise fares or not. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the railway, said: “Fares are underpinning a once-in-a-generation investment plan to improve the railway and politicians effectively determine that season ticket prices should change in line with other day-to-day costs to help fund this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e7f9a4f9c0b66fc2efc87f85d8dd1c65a3ad7e/0_0_3287_2226/master/3287.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566206962b9c7e85cd33e61fc2d87f39 480w","title":"labour calls claims about corbyn palestinian cemetery visit false","story":"Party says leader had been attending memorial to Palestinian airstrike victimsLabour has hit out at what it said were “false and misleading” claims about Jeremy Corbyn’s visit to the Palestinian cemetery in Tunis and insisted he had attended an annual memorial for victims of an Israeli air attack on the Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters in October 1985.The party offered its most complete version of events yet about Corbyn’s controversial visit in 2014, and said the commemoration for the 74 people who had died was attended by “mainstream leaders”, including a Palestinian authority minister.“None of those who carried out the Munich massacre are buried in the Palestinian cemetery at Tunis and there was no ceremony held for them,” a Labour spokesman said as the party tried to dampen the row generated by the trip.Controversy about Corbyn’s trip to the Tunisian capital for a conference and to the Palestinian cemetery surfaced on Saturday, when it was reported he was present at an event when a wreath was laid by a grave of a PLO leader who was believed to be a mastermind of the Black September terror group.The Labour leader reiterated on Tuesday that he was at the event in the cemetery only to commemorate victims of the airstrike. Expressing frustration, Corbyn said: “I laid one wreath along with many other people in memory of all those who died in the awful attack in 1985, which – I keep repeating and you seem not to understand – was condemned by the whole world.”A Labour spokesman said: “Claims made about Jeremy Corbyn’s visit to the Palestinian national cemetery outside Tunis in 2014 have been both false and misleading. He attended a conference on Palestine in Tunis at the invitation of the Tunisian president with other European parliamentarians, including a Conservative and Liberal Democrat from the UK.”The spokesman added that a delegation from the conference “went to commemorate and lay a wreath at the cemetery in memory of the dozens of Palestinians and Tunisians, including civilians, killed at the site by an Israeli air attack in 1985, condemned at the time by the UN”.The row about Corbyn’s visit surfaced when the Daily Mail published a picture on Saturday of Corbyn holding a wreath near the grave of Salah Khalaf, who was assassinated in Tunis in 1991. Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, was the PLO’s second in command, and has been described as the mastermind of Black September, which was behind the Munich Olympics terror attack in 1972.On Monday, Corbyn said he was present but not involved at a wreath laying for Khalaf and other senior PLO associates triggered a row with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Corbyn’s actions deserved “unequivocal condemnation”.Labour said that some of those buried at the cemetery, including Khalaf and Atef Bseiso, were senior political figures in the PLO. The party said that “both have been accused by Israel of having had links with Black September in the early 1970s, though they always denied it, as has the PLO. Both were senior Fatah and PLO leaders of the time, and Palestinian officials continue to pay respects to them.”The spokesman added: “Jeremy did not take part in laying wreaths on their graves.” The party said the wreath the Labour leader was pictured holding was for victims of the 1985 air strike and its decorative ribbon says in Arabic “monitoring the Palestinian legal and political issue” and that was the title of the conference he was attending.The conference in Tunisia was also attended by Lord Sheikh, a Conservative peer, and Lord Phillips of Sudbury, a Liberal Democrat. Sheikh said that he had only attended the conference, did not join the delegation to the cemetery and was only aware of Corbyn’s presence when he arrived at the event.Sheikh declared the trip on his register of interests in 2014, but Corbyn did not. Labour said that Corbyn stayed for two nights and that the value of the trip, including flight and accommodation, was less than the financial threshold required for a declaration.Corbyn’s presence at the event was criticised by the Conservatives. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, tweeted: “If Jeremy Corbyn thinks terrorism is justified for the causes he believes in, how would he as prime minister have the moral authority to condemn terrorist murders of British citizens? Unbelievable and shocking.”But the Labour leader won support from Palestine’s ambassador to the UK, who said that the then-Labour MP was in Tunis to commemorate “a blatant act of Israeli violence and aggression” when he was present at the wreath-laying ceremony.In a statement, Manuel Hassassian said: “At the ceremony, Mr Corbyn stands with Palestinian authority officials including Dr Mohammed Shtayyeh. He takes part in a ceremony of remembrance for those brutally killed.”The ambassador said the 1985 airstrike “could be legitimately called an act of terror and state terrorism. The attack was vigorously condemned by the UN security council, which voted in its favour 14-0. In the attack, 62 Palestinians and 12 Tunisians were killed.”But there was concern in Israel. A column in a leading newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, warned on Monday that Corbyn’s actions, including a visit to the “grave of the person who planned the terror attack at the Munich Olympics”, were of deep concern.“The paradox is that the least antisemitic country in Europe is liable to fall into the hands of an antisemitic politician,” wrote Ben-Dror Yemini. “Up until recently, the biggest concern was that this would be as a result of the rise of one of the extreme rightwing parties. As of now, the chance is much greater is that this will come from the left of all places.”Israel’s Labor party secretary general, Yehiel Bar, said: “The grave new discoveries about Corbyn are no surprise, to my regret, and they only further justify the Labor party’s decision from several months ago to completely sever all ties with Mr Corbyn and his office.”A Labour spokesman said: “Jeremy’s presence at the Tunis conference and the ceremony at the cemetery is a mark of his long and principled commitment to the struggle for Palestinian rights. That should be a matter for respect, not condemnation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a63ca0a93e4b0ccbb92664fca75e04384cf7a4/0_224_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0898ae9669b14fbc4f4397af28214e","title":"are all those dinosaur fossils worth the fuss","story":"Researchers are encouraged to embrace the media to communicate their science. But are the sexy headlines at the expense of telling stories of real significance?Recently, I got into a heated discussion with a colleague who felt I’d written about a fossil discovery that was not worthy of attention. They believed the author was only interested in self-promotion and the fossil was of no scientific importance. My reasons for covering it were simple: I thought it was a story the public would find interesting, and more importantly it provided an opportunity to broaden out the subject for readers.In my colleague’s opinion, however, these were the wrong reasons. They explained the story was not worthy of attention, no matter what the public thought. It is up to us as scientists to tell the public what they should find interesting.There’s no doubt certain areas of palaeontology grab public attention, regardless of the quality of the research or broader significance of the fossils. Just adding the word dinosaur transforms any headline into clickbait. But do the public really need guidance on what to think about science?“It’s hard to tell people what they ought to think!” says Deborah Cohen MBE, the editor for BBC radio science. Having worked as a science editor for almost 30 years, Cohen has seen science communication in the media transform. “We have to assess the scientific importance of stories. Occasionally, we go for the biggest or smallest or so on, but really we want our stories to have scientific significance. So something that changes the way we understand the history of life, or that we weren’t expecting, or it fills in a gap in our knowledge or the fossil record - all the best stories help us to better understand the history of life.”If a good piece of research fails to catch public attention, you could blame the scientists for failing to come up with a “hook” to promote it. But as anyone who works on fish, insects or plants will tell you, there’s only so much you can do to pimp your research to lure in the press. It’s a foregone conclusion by the mainstream media that the public isn’t interested in these topics. But surely it is up to talented writers to bring out the amazing tales that lie behind all scientific research?“There’s more than a million scientific papers published each year,” says Professor Richard Butler of the University of Birmingham. “We can’t expect journalists and the public without specialist knowledge to filter the significant papers from the routine.”Like other conscientious researchers, Butler encourages his students to evaluate the best way to share their findings. This includes online articles, dissemination via social media, and more conventional communication.“We do put out occasional press releases,” says Butler, “but we try to reserve this for publications that we feel are particularly significant scientifically, and likely to be of interest to the general public.” There is increased recognition of the importance of science communication across the disciplines, particularly as much research is funded with public money. Science communication can take many forms. While media publicity is perhaps the most visible, it is not necessarily the most effective avenue for science communication.There are other reasons why some stories get attention while other do not, explains Anna Lacey, the producer of the BBC radio series CrowdScience. “A good image can make all the difference, so that’s why feathers, footprints and big complete skeletons tend to get picked up. If a journalist has to launch into a whole load of background and some esoteric explanation for why this new find is a big deal, then chances are it won’t get commissioned.” For anyone working in the media, there is a constant balance to be struck between reporting new science, and hitting topics the public is already curious about. So, could all the attention given to less scientifically important discoveries diminish the impact of more significant publications? In other words: are overblown press releases acting like the boy-who-cried-dinosaur?  “In our department we’re all very interested in palaeontology,” Cohen says, “but I have noticed that our colleagues in other departments are sometimes a little less enthusiastic. Sometimes the news desk will say ‘oh no, not another dinosaur discovery’ … So it goes to show we can’t assume there’s an insatiable appetite.” It’s obviously important that science has a good story, but problems arise when those who do the reporting can’t recognise hype. Without wider context, buzzwords thrown in to jazz up an otherwise poor piece of science catch the eye of journalists. Conversely, press releases on amazing advances may not stand out to journalists because their topics require more effort to communicate.This is undoubtedly where writers and journalists with a scientific background are invaluable, as they are less constrained by preconceptions of public interest – or a desire for clicks – and are motivated instead to find a way to share what they inherently know are fascinating scientific advances. No one will ever be interested in the subtler streams of palaeontological research if no one takes the time to enthuse about them.While media attention can be an effective form of science communication, it can also be an avenue for self, rather than scientific, promotion. Repeated attention given to a few inidual researchers often has more to do with their success at networking with journalists than their expertise. Journalists are often short on time, and may turn to the same few names for comment simply because they know they’ll get a friendly soundbite. Such iniduals are happy to comment even when their expertise lies elsewhere. Being quoted is often more important than directing journalists to colleagues who know more on the topic. This can have a negative impact of public perception of what a scientist looks like, as many of these go-to-faces also fit the white male scientist stereotype.“We like to go to primary sources,” says Cohen, “but if we find that person is not good at explaining the science in simple terms, we might turn to a co-author or someone else in the field. Whoever it is must be good at communicating.” She added: “But to be honest, palaeontologists are generally excellent communicators.”Perhaps all press is good press, but it’s clear that getting your research to hit the headlines is not always straightforward – nor is it always desirable. While there is no doubt that certain discoveries need no help catching the eye of a commissioning editor, the onus lies with scientists to evaluate the best way to bring their research to a wider audience. Writers with scientific training play a vital role in balancing sensationalism, and counterbalancing those personalities who may enjoy the limelight just a little too much.“We are in a competitive landscape and have to intrigue people with stories of human discovery,” says Cohen, “but when the scientific importance is less obvious it’s up to us to find clever ways to get people interested. It’s up to us to make it interesting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f172f8a65fdded5f5a592cc2c9d96b064908da87/0_0_2500_1408/master/2500.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a43d10318e147da1e204e366ce836cef 720w","title":"ben stokes verdict cannot hide game disrepute england allrounder","story":"The England and Wales Cricket Board must have been heartily relieved by the Test team’s emphatic victory over India at Lord’s with their clean-cut all-rounder Chris Woakes excelling while Ben Stokes, grim-faced, clad in his smart blue suit and ritually snapped by photographers, made his daily trip to a Bristol courtroom.There Stokes relived the details of a night that went horribly wrong in the city last September after a routine victory over West Indies in a one-day international. Then he would reappear in front of the cameras in the afternoon, providing just about the only sighting of an English cricketer on terrestrial TV since the 2005 Ashes series.Now the ECB can contemplate another victory of sorts, which is so much more complicated to interpret. One of its employees has been found not guilty of affray and is available to go about his business, but it must also consider whether it is appropriate for him to do so. This was not a day for triumphalism from Stokes or those who employ him at Lord’s.It must have been an ugly week for Stokes while his teammates were enjoying a glorious victory in London but in the end he could allow himself a mild smile. The verdict means that he can concentrate on being a cricketer again. The incident may soon become a tiny blot on a glittering career he could easily become one of England’s greatest all-rounders. Even so, some stern self-assessment would not go amiss.The court case may have been survived but there is no escaping that Stokes has brought the game into disrepute. The video footage of a feral night out does not reveal the kind of images that the ECB, so desperate to promote the game to families, wants to be identified with. Indeed, it would be a minor disaster if the verdict leads Stokes to think that he did nothing wrong in Bristol last September, and there is a danger that this might now be the case.The very best cricketers often ooze invincibility they are never out and never wrong. They feel invulnerable, capable of dominating any situation. I have witnessed this at close quarters when playing alongside Ian Botham or while keeping an eye on the careers of Andrew Flintoff, Brian Lara and Kevin Pietersen. Such was their predominance in the game that they sometimes concluded that the normal rules did not apply.In part this explains why some players are so good self-belief is the most cherished asset among sportsmen. The great ones do not seem to fear failing instead they take control of what happens in the middle, and sometimes this glorious feeling of power extends beyond the boundary. Which is when it becomes dangerous.The easy suggestion to such sportsmen when they are in trouble off the field is to be just a bit more careful, more sensible, but this advice seldom hits home. Such caginess is not in their DNA. Perhaps they are great because they live dangerously or ignore some of the basic rules of the road for a professional cricketer. These men rarely function if instructed to wear carpet slippers.Stokes lives in an era of management teams as well as ever-present iPhones that can record and relay every second of every day – and night. Hence a big night out is always a risky business. In Botham’s era the backroom staff were not so sophisticated. He once had an agent, Tim Hudson, whose response to an allegation about Ian smoking cannabis was famously, “Doesn’t everyone?” Now it behoves not only Stokes, but also his support network, to ensure that there is no repeat of the behaviour that took him back to Bristol.Seeing Stokes solemnly heading into the courtroom has been a depressing sight. This was an alien environment for him, no more comfortable than the prospect of a well-heeled barrister walking out to combat a swinging cricket ball propelled by Jimmy Anderson it was an unpalatable contest. The outcome will, no doubt, be met with relief at the ECB, though it may still be startled there has not been more contrition from Stokes about his behaviour that night.Now the Cricket Discipline Commission must decide whether to take any action against Stokes. He has not broken the law but he may have fractured some trust with his employer. Recently Steve Smith and David Warner were banned from the international game by their board for 12 months because a cricket ball had been surreptitiously scraped with sandpaper and subsequently they were found to be economical with the truth.The two episodes are hard to compare but by most people’s standards a flick of sandpaper and a dodgy press conference does not seem so much worse than what happened in Bristol.As ever the ECB will seek to marry principle with pragmatism. The CDC now lurches into action. Stokes may now play at Trent Bridge this week but he could be subsequently suspended later in the year. However, the nightmare scenario has been avoided. The summer of 2019 is the most exciting imaginable – before we head off into the abyss – with the World Cup, which England are far better placed to win than usual – especially if Ben Stokes is at full throttle – and an Ashes series.For all the excellence shown by Woakes and Sam Curran in the last two Tests, Stokes at his best remains the linchpin of the side, whatever the colour of the ball. There should be no pretending that England are as good without him. Moreover, the players want him back. The dressing room provides the most accurate barometer of someone’s character and the England team like having Stokes there – not just for his cricketing prowess.However, he needs help and an open mind. He could do much worse than consider the career of Ricky Ponting and, maybe, have a chat with him. Ponting had his moments of madness in bars as a young Australian cricketer and was dropped in 1999 after an incident in Sydney which left him unconscious in the early hours of the morning. He was not required to go to court but he acknowledged a problem with alcohol and his off-field behaviour, and with appropriate help he resolved it before going on to have the most brilliant of careers. With some brutal self-examination on his part there is still time for Stokes to do something similar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d8a28fc460d4e44dc78072ea036850e9cbab68/12_209_1439_864/master/1439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e65f00ba43ec6e2beaf00bcfa0ac927","title":"gay couple say ben stokes did not deserve to face trial","story":"Kai Barry and William O’Connor say they appreciate the cricketer defending themKai Barry and William O’Connor, the couple Ben Stokes said he had been defending in a fight outside a Bristol nightclub, may have been at the heart of the cricketer’s trial, but they were visibly absent from the witness box and no statements were read from them.Jurors were not told why the men were not called, with the judge, Peter Blair QC, saying only that it would be wrong for them to speculate about any witnesses the prosecution or defence did not call. The main thrust of Stokes’ defence was that he was protecting the couple from homophobic abuse. What exactly that abuse was, he could not remember.A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The evidence of Mr O’Connor and Mr Barry was disclosed to the defence but it was not deemed necessary to call them as witnesses in the case.”On Tuesday, Stokes and Ryan Ali were found not guilty of affray. A third man, Ryan Hale, was acquitted of the charge last Thursday on the directions of the judge. Speaking after the trial, the couple told ITV they were grateful to the cricketer, who “didn’t deserve being put through a trial”.Barry said: “When I realised who he was, I thought, fair play. He’s obviously put his career at risk for someone that he never knew. Thank you for being there. Sorry about all the drama we landed you in, but a lot of appreciation.”The court heard that during the fight Barry had received a “glancing blow” on the shoulder from Ali, who was holding a bottle from which he had been drinking.Ali denied homophobia was involved. Stokes, who dismissed claims put to him in court that he had “mimicked” the couple and flicked a cigarette butt at them, also denied homophobia. CCTV footage appeared to show him escorting them away from the violence.Though they did not give evidence to the trial, a month after the incident, the couple gave an exclusive joint interview to the Sun, praising Stokes for his actions.They said they had not realised who he was at the time: “We couldn’t believe it when we found out they were famous cricketers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f32375a8fc91afd26481102fe0f44223930c67c7/0_436_8660_5199/master/8660.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b263002a0d105d2e723d2f4ea0a8d445","title":"faster higher stronger not in olympic womens road cycling","story":"A watered-down Tokyo 2020 course suggests the Olympic motto ‘Citius, Altius, Fortius’ is relevant only to menThe routes for the Olympic road races were recently announced by the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee and the UCI, and something is yet again conspicuously absent from the women’s course. Women’s races seem to be chronically afflicted by a phenomenon whereby marquee features which form integral aspects of the men’s race tend to inexplicably go missing. Regrettably, the Olympic parcours is yet another egregious example of this.  The official route summary explains that both the men’s and women’s courses will commence in Musashinonomori Park on the outskirts of Tokyo and subsequently take in two climbs on Donushi Road and Kagasaka Pass. The document then abruptly announces, “it is here that the men and women’s courses erge”. And this is where it all goes downhill, so to speak, at least for the women. Yet after their initial two climbs, the women will have to make do with a paltry one and a half laps of the speedway circuit before rolling over the finish line. Their route somehow completely bypasses the most spectacular and potentially race-defining elements that are present in the men’s course.  When the female peloton, as a matter of routine, is almost always provided with flatter, arguably easier and less iconic courses than their male counterparts, this only serves to reinforce the notion that female riders are somehow incapable of conquering anything more challenging. The entire situation appears to be nothing more than good old-fashioned paternalism masquerading under some less-malevolent veneer of traditionalism.  These days, particularly following the release of Agenda 2022, which lists gender equality as one of its main goals, the UCI is often quick to tout its reinvigorated commitment to gender parity. However, with this latest exercise in poorly thought out course design, it can hardly hold itself up as the bastion of equality that it so staunchly purports to be. Following the latest brouhaha that’s been stirred up by the Olympic route announcement, Agenda 2022 would appear to be nothing more than a reflexive pat on the back by the UCI that is bereft of any accompanying concrete action.  The governing body was, after all, very much involved in designing the women’s course alongside the Tokyo Organising Committee, and was presumably required to rubber stamp the woeful women’s parcours.  Is the UCI incapable of hearing the increasingly vociferous demands of their constituents for race parity?  With the Olympics providing a rare occasion for a women’s race to be televised to a global audience, the disappointingly drab course is a sorely missed opportunity to showcase the capabilities of the female peloton to an unprecedentedly wide viewership. Precisely when the world will be watching is the time to provide women with a challenging and testing course, not lop it in half and eviscerate it of its most exciting components. Given the sheer notoriety of the Olympic Games, providing women with an equal course would do much to wipe existing prejudices about women’s racing from the public consciousness. However, viewers may instead only come away with the impression that female riders are second-class athletes on the bike. After first lamenting the uninspired Bergen and Innsbruck World Championships courses, followed by La Course, the one-day race that is ostensibly the answer to a women’s Tour de France, we are again left asking the same question, this time of the Olympics road race: why are the men’s and women’s courses so different?  Until women are allowed to crest the heights of iconic climbs, ride faster down their descents, and show their strength across incredibly demanding parcours, then the Olympic motto “faster, higher, stronger,” at least in cycling, will only be applicable to the men.

The sordid details of the episode have been exhaustively documented and need not be recounted here. Suffice it to say the 14-times major winner never did regain the unassailable form that made him the first billion-dollar sportsman.A brief flicker of hope a half-decade ago, when he won five tournaments and managed to regain the world No\u0026nbsp1 ranking, appeared in time to represent the final sparks spitting from a burnt-out log on a fire before it goes out completely. Woods entered a scant nine of the 19 major championships staged from the 2013 US PGA Championship to the 2018 US Open, missing the cut five times and never finishing better than tied for 17th.Concerns over his personal life, dormant for years as he settled back into a quiet normalcy, resurfaced last year when he was charged with driving under the influence after he was found asleep in his Mercedes-Benz, apparently after taking a prescription painkiller and sleeping medication. A few months later, he admitted he may never play competitively again. Even though he looked the same on the outside, the engine on the chassis was broken. It was time to shut it down.A decade before it would have been difficult to imagine ever feeling pity for Woods, but as recently as last month it had become difficult to not feel sorry for him. Yet we all kept watching despite the gnawing suspicion he was finished, and the end would not be pleasant. Woods, a veteran of four major back surgeries in recent years, had become the Mike Tyson of golf, a prodigy and uniquely American success story who arrested the imagination of the public so entirely that it was left in a state of denial over his downfall.Then came last month’s Open at Carnoustie, where Woods made his first legitimate run at a major title in years, finishing in a tie for sixth. That proved only a prelude to last week’s US PGA Championship at Bellerive, where he loomed in contention for three days before delivering a round for the ages on Sunday afternoon. He managed to finish three under despite hitting one fairway on the front nine, then birdied the 18th for a six-under 64 – his lowest score in the final round of a major – and finished two strokes behind Brooks Koepka in second place but first in the hearts of the St Louis masses.To behold Woods even contending for a major, validating the collective hope that for so long had flown in the face of our better senses, is a remarkable tale enough.If he did somehow win one of the four bedrock events – he will be 43 when he gets a crack at next year’s Masters – it would be one of the greatest stories in the history of sport, if only because for so much of the past decade it would have seemed almost impossible. The legacy of a great athlete often reaches its zenith well after his or her actual prime – a phenomenon uniquely measurable in boxing, where top fighters often collect their highest purses when their best days are behind them.The shrewd business is the public paying not for the product at hand but a memory – a feeling. The mania that surrounded Tiger throughout Sunday, quantifiable by the teeming masses that followed him and cheered his every success, and the TV ratings that suggest a mainstream crossover that had been lacking for most of the past decade, evoked a time when he was a figure larger than life. He was the rare chosen one who not only met but also surpassed the stratospheric expectations placed upon him during his late-90s ascent and held the world in his thrall. It is a collective fascination borne from nostalgia, saying as much about us as Woods.To watch him beat back the encroachment of time and fight to regain the form of his youth represents a longing for a time when we were younger, maybe a bit fitter and happier, less weighed down by the advance of years.Life can be a process of losing things you will never get back – but for a brief moment as he made pursuit of that elusive 15th major title, we were transported even briefly to a fairer, better time that mostly existed in our memories.Winter is the most compelling season of a top sportsman’s journey, when the hero must negotiate and problem-solve where ine gifts were once enough. Muhammad Ali suspended on the ropes in Zaire when he could no longer depend on his legs to pirouette from harm’s way.

For so long, Woods’s only competition was himself. Those days are long gone. But although his major drought will have entered an 11th year when he tees off at Augusta next year, he has shown he is very much back – and we are all richer for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cc6dd7afe3493ea2e4a40165ef234486a68ba35/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd65bbc746429e869fba3fb131ece2ef","title":"egg sperm donors revelations fertility edinburgh","story":"Theatre and acrobatic shows at the Edinburgh festival use the experiences of donors to explore fertility, faith and family‘Who is the family?” asks aerial artist and theatre-maker Sarah Bebe Holmes. With her company Paper Doll Militia, she is using her own experience to pose that question to audiences at the Edinburgh fringe.Ten years ago, Holmes became an egg donor for her best friend Carol. A decade on, her experience of the fertility treadmill – from intrusive tests to hormone injections – has inspired Egg, a new show combining narration, music and aerial acrobatics, while posing questions about female sexuality and public perceptions of infertility.Down the corridor at the Summerhall venue, James Rowland’s show Revelations draws upon his best friends’ request for him to be their sperm donor. Completing a trilogy of one-man shows that includes Team Viking and A Hundred Different Words for Love, Revelations is described by Rowland as “the story of being very close to and also at one remove from your best friends. It’s about my friends Sarah and Emma having a baby, which is a great thing that hadn’t been culturally accepted anywhere until fairly recently.”Emotional strain is also a theme in Egg. Though she quickly and wholeheartedly agreed to donate her eggs, Holmes found the experience tough. “The invasiveness of it – even though it was me giving my eggs to a dear friend – it became less personal and quite public and exposing.” In putting that process on stage, Holmes wants to be as honest as possible about what she and Carol went through. “The story is very true to how the events unfolded,” she says.Rowland is fuzzier on the truth. While his storytelling trilogy shares the same cast of characters and an element of autobiography, there’s a deliberately blurry line between fact and fiction. Team Viking opened with the words: “I’m going to tell you a story and all of it is true.” In A Hundred Different Words for Love he told audiences “none of it is true”. At the start of Revelations, Rowland simply says: “I’m going to tell you a story.” He explains: “Each one of those statements … is giving the audience licence to believe what I’m saying.”In both shows, the creation of new life is a springboard for other ideas. In Egg, Holmes wants to interrogate the control and scrutiny involved in fertility treatment and blast open our assumptions about what makes a family. “As soon as you need any help in creating your family, suddenly you’re scrutinised,” she says. Becoming an egg donor brought her even closer to Carol and her husband, but their family unit was often dismissed or misunderstood. “I moved in with Carol for the last three months of her pregnancy and we went to birthing classes together,” she remembers. “It was hilarious, because the three of us walked in and they just looked at us and they were like: ‘Are you Mormon or something?’” On stage, Egg’s clear PVC set leaves Holmes with nowhere to hide. At crucial points in the narrative, the process of fertility treatment is represented through aerial sequences, with Holmes suspended in a PVC womb or dangling precariously from plastic ropes.For Rowland, meanwhile, birth and parenthood are ways of thinking about religious belief. He’s playing with “this idea of there being some sort of eternal parent who’s looking after and protecting you”, as well as exploring the “intolerant liberality” of many who reject and dismiss Christianity. “I grew up a Christian,” he says, “and so there’s a lot of talking about that through the vehicle of new life. One of the things that people tend to be quite intolerant about is the invisible things that people choose to believe in their own heads, which don’t hurt anybody and aren’t actually harmful.” Rowland jokes about the importance of exposing himself in Revelations – “it’s a pun, because I do actually get my kit off in this show” – but, more seriously, he values and welcomes vulnerability in performance. “I think people are interesting when they’re vulnerable. That’s where not all but a lot of the best stuff can happen.” Regardless of how “true” the narratives, both creator-performers expose much about themselves in Egg and Revelations. Holmes recalls one work-in-progress performance. “I felt like I just threw my soul all over the floor,” she says, “and I had to pick it back up again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/719e7c463a031c35aabb5f56ba5d2fb2acb27186/0_187_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9cf111084b11be672f948ce308e5ac3","title":"what girls are made of review traverse edinburgh","story":"Traverse, EdinburghDarlingheart’s Cora Bissett writes and stars in an artfully told look at the highs and lows of her time in a bandCora Bissett was a teenager when her Glenrothes-based band Darlingheart secured one of the biggest record deals in Scottish music history and shot to fame. Her bandmates were still tangled in exams. Potentially life-changing gigs clashed with school concerts, and free drinks on flights made them giddy, but innocence soon waned as she came up against the industry and had to deal with broken friendships and being sexualised by the media too young.Twenty-five years on, Bissett reveals that the feeling of being out of your depth never fades. Taking stock in this autobiographical story infused with humour and song, the former indie star uses gig-theatre in a way that could suit few performers better.Bissett intersperses her artfully told stories with songs she loved, many by women who have made a name for themselves in a world dominated by men: Patti Smith’s Horses, Dress by PJ Harvey, Dolly Parton’s Jolene. She demonstrates the confidence fame gives and shows how it can be knocked by a bad review.However far the professional fall, it’s the personal struggles that sting the most. It’s easy to forget that rock stars have parents too, and Bissett’s description of her father’s memory fading is a sucker punch. She gets across something of the fear of being a parent as well: wanting the best for your child but not knowing where each decision will lead.Bissett is a warm presence and a magnificent performer. Directed by Orla O’Loughlin, the cast also includes actor-musicians Simon Donaldson and Grant O’Rourke and producer-engineer Susan Bear, who all e between characters, switching from family debates to playground fights and wild tour nights.As she stands centre stage, surrounded by winding microphone cables and neon borders, there is no one telling Bissett what she can say, wear, sing or be. In a Pixies T-shirt, she is at once her teenage indie-kid self, listening to her song on the radio for the first time, and a mother and performer, the drum beat of her young daughter’s heart echoing behind her. Holding a box of magazine clippings that her dad collected, she clings to her memories to ground herself. As she shouts defiantly into the microphone with music pulsing through the theatre, the night belongs to her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/306cd02092b55e67919a874636788add6f58a4fc/0_0_4281_2568/master/4281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b563ea7ecf68a60dc026e2088d8baa2d","title":"a passage to britain review who do you think you are for the empire","story":"This new series tells the story of migration to the UK from the Indian subcontinent through ships’ records, starting with the Viceroy of IndiaThe Viceroy of India is not a suburban curry house. It’s not even the colonial office after which a suburban curry house is named, but rather a ship. It’s a splendid one, too, a\u0026nbspP\u0026ampO number with interiors modelled\u0026nbspon an English country house. Well, one wants to\u0026nbspfeel at home – even at sea.The Viceroy plied the Mumbai-Tilbury route in the 1930s, linking two very different worlds that had been entwined for centuries by the bonds of empire. By the 30s, these bonds were beginning to fracture. The passenger lists of the Viceroy and other ships survive in the National Archive, and it is through these lists and ships that Yasmin Khan tells the story of\u0026nbspmigration to Britain from the Indian subcontinent (BBC Two).Around two-thirds of the names on the Viceroy’s 1933\u0026nbsplists are British: colonialists heading back to pick up a hamper at Fortnum’s or whatever. Khan is not so fussed about them she wants to find out the stories behind the Asian names, people who were changed by\u0026nbspBritain – and changed it.Netra Dutt was 21 when he arrived in Tilbury on 25\u0026nbspOctober 1933. His death was registered in London in the 90s. Dutt was an early pioneer of the British-Asian community. Here is his daughter, Anjali Martin, a\u0026nbspmaths tutor in London. Suddenly, it’s not just about black-and-white photos and passenger lists. It’s alive – and more human and relevant because of it.Khan and Martin travel to Kolkata, from where Dutt’s family hailed, and his story gets better. Martin knew that her father failed the Indian civil service exam now she finds out why his family may have thought he needed to get out. An educated, well-to-do Bengali student, he was exactly the kind of person who was starting to rebel against British rule. Ironic, perhaps, that he was packed off to the heart of the oppressor. From Martin’s point of view, though, it is a bit of result: you would rather have a potential revolutionary for a dad\u0026nbspthan a failed civil servant, wouldn’t you?Yes, it is kind of along the lines of Who Do You Think You Are?, but Dutt’s story is part of a much bigger and more important one. It’s more like Who Does Britain Think It Is?.Also on the Viceroy with Dutt was another radical opponent of empire, Mulk Raj Anand, the writer known as the founding father of the Indo-English novel. He\u0026nbspmade an interesting contribution to Indo-British cuisine. Khan goes to Chichester to see his niece Anne, who makes a big pot of Uncle Mulk’s curry, the principal ingredients of which are lamb, pieces of chopped apple and several spoons of Branston pickle. Mmm.It worked on Anne’s Auntie Kathleen, though. She met Mulk at a party, where he was making one of those curries. She went over, dipped a finger in, flirted with him and a few months later they were married.It wasn’t all revolutionaries and future celebrated novelists on the Viceroy in 1933. Khan also looks into Ruth Martin – not English as the name suggests, but an Indian servant, an aya or nanny. Khan finds the British baby she was looking after, Raja Stokes, alive and well and living in Newmarket. Stokes (named after the maharaja for whom his father was a jockey), now 86, was one year old on the voyage he has a photo of him sitting on board on his aya’s knee.The empire may have been beginning to crack, but at sea it was as strong as ever – the caste system, too. There were no splendid interiors for Martin on the Viceroy: she slept on deck. “Oh,\u0026nbspmy goodness,” says Stokes, when Khan points this out. “Poor aya ... Yes, I feel a little bit sorry for her, and embarrassed.” The shame of the empire, in miniature.Next episode, the ship is the Asturias, the story that of the people who came to Britain during the dramatic events at the end of the empire. Meanwhile, Britain’s Asian population grows and becomes a community.It’s a clever route in, the ships and the lists – a way to cast and personalise a big chunk of 20th-century British history. Did the current government not know about the passenger lists, I wonder? Well, clearly not, otherwise they would have destroyed them – and deported all the descendants of everyone on them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd520590813f07077eb4d82edc29df4a232e6e27/0_2_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52adebb357e9427f354b01813140dfe4","title":"happy together lonely baby boomers turn to co housing","story":"For older people, co-housing offers a sense of community without losing independence When Rose Mark retired from being a teacher, she and her husband decided to leave their bustling San Francisco neighbourhood to find somewhere they would feel safer. One problem: the booming local tech scene had turbocharged demand for homes, and they found themselves outbid time and again.As well as security, Mark craved a connection with her neighbours. Previously, she would be lucky to get a quick “hi” on the street. “I’m very friendly. I’ve lived in many different neighbourhoods in San Francisco,” she says. “I’d try to make friends but there wasn’t a sense of community.”Then, among the artist studios and loft apartments on the colourful streets of Jingletown, Oakland, Mark found an answer: the Phoenix Commons, a co-housing community for over-55s. Residents own their modest homes while sharing spacious communal areas, including a kitchen, movie room and a hot tub. The community is self-managed, residents work together in committees and each night a group volunteers cooks for everyone.The four-storey complex of 41 units is designed to foster a sense of community. Apartment windows face each other and walkways create a visible sense of life and movement. Mark was one of the first to move in, two years ago. She appreciates how much residents help each other, from sharing food to supporting someone through the death of a partner. “My friends jokingly call this the Commune,” she says. “If they could witness life here, it might allay some of their fears about giving up their independence. It is an incredible feeling of security, safety and peacefulness.”Co-housing is growing in popularity with young and old around the world. There are 165 co-housing communities in the US and another 140 in the planning stages. In the UK, Older Women’s Co-Housing (OWCH) in north London has a long waiting list and there are 20 other established co-housing communities, and 40 in development. Co-housing is a long-established part of the housing mix in the Netherlands and Sweden, where communities are supported by government, and the idea is growing in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. Interest in co-housing has risen since the economic downturn and as housing costs in cities surged. Many may argue it is a lamentable trend, but closer ties with neighbours can provide an antidote to the modern epidemic of loneliness, particularly among older people.Half a century ago in the summer of love, baby boomers were part of a seismic cultural shift, and now another is under way, this time revolutionising retirement. This generation of retirees are the healthiest ever and crave continued personal independence while maintaining community ties.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theRobby Kiley, 75, a Phoenix Commons resident, describes traditional retirement homes as “landed cruise ships”, where meals and entertainment are provided at a cost. She worries that an absence of responsibilities leads to regression and decline. Phoenix Commons is self-managed, and residents must be able to live independently. That excludes people who require care but encourages those who want to continue to lead a relatively active lifestyle. “We’re always learning,” says Kiley. “Here you have to keep up.”Christian Zimmerman set up Phoenix Commons because, he says, it’s the way that he wants to grow old: in close proximity with his peers and not a passive consumer. “Living alone in an apartment is not the best way to live,” says Zimmerman, who spent 45 years managing retirement homes. “I don’t think a lot of people like it. I think they’re just afraid of the other things. They’re afraid that if they move into a community that they’re not going to get along with somebody, or they’re not going to get enough privacy. But what price privacy?” A couple of hours’ drive inland, in the university town of Davis, is another co-housing community, America’s oldest. Muir Commons was set up in 1991 by two architecture graduates, Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, who had researched co-housing communities in Denmark.The design for the multigenerational Muir Commons fills a typical American block, but instead of regimented rows of houses facing the road, homes have been built at angles to each other with open and connected front gardens. Children run back and forth, enjoying a communal playground, an orchard and vegetable beds. Cars are kept out of the way in car parks, and there is a common house where the community eats together a couple of nights a week.Ben Finkelor moved in because he thought it would be good for his children. “You open your front door and they can play and there’s no cars,” he says. “You can share parenting. We have social activities. On Father’s Day we have a water fight – dads vs the kids.” He thinks his children benefit from interacting with older residents.“The intergenerational thing is very important,” agrees Ray Frank, 72, another resident. “I would never want to live in a community of people of essentially the same age. It’s such a delight to watch children growing up. And we’ve found that the kids here grow up with certain skills that most other children don’t develop easily. They learn how to talk to people of all ages.”Residents say the Muir Commons children have better social skills, and the older residents without children and grandchildren of their own get to enjoy a sense of family.According to Stephanie Cacioppo, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Chicago, loneliness among retirees in the US is becoming an alarming public health issue. “The availability of community programmes, behavioural interventions and online resources is increasing to address the problem of loneliness. Co-housing is one of these programmes that gives us hope,” she says.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

We don’t think they should be outbid by wealthier people from overseas.”In a speech to parliament on Wednesday he said: “We should not be tenants in our own land.”Only a quarter of adults in New Zealand own their own home, compared with half in 1991, and in the last five years homeless figures have increased, with some New Zealanders forced to live in cars, garages and under bridges.The ban applies to all nationalities, except buyers from Singapore and Australia.New Zealand has become a destination for Chinese, Australian and Asian buyers and has gained a reputation as a bolthole for the world’s wealthy, who view it as a safe haven from a potential nuclear conflict, the rise of terrorism and civil unrest, or simply as a place to get away from it all.Under the new legislation foreigners would still be able to purchase apartments in large-scale block developments off the plans, in an attempt to boost the overall housing stock for New Zealanders.Parker says in places like the Queenstown Lakes, where US multi-millionaires Peter Thiel and Matt Lauer have purchased properties, the ban will induce construction companies to build more smaller, family-friendly homes.However, under the new law Thiel would still be able to buy property in New Zealand. Thiel became a New Zealand citizen despite having spent only eight days in the country after he gained approval under the former government.“We were in opposition at the time Peter Thiel was granted citizenship,” said Parker. “We can’t undo what has already been done. But that won’t happen in the future.”The ban on foreign ownership is at the heart of the government’s plan to tackle the housing crisis, as well as its commitment to build 100,000 affordable new homes in ten years, and increase social housing stock by 6400 homes in four years.Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said although the government’s efforts were “better than nothing” they lacked ambition.The foreign buyer ban would make it “cumbersome” for foreigners to invest in building new housing stock in New Zealand, and that could dissuade them from trying, meaning less homes and apartments could potentially be built, Eaqub said.“The kind of property that billionaires buy is never going to be used for public or social housing. Locking out multi-million dollar buyers doesn’t mean developers will start building smaller, basic houses. There is never a market for poor people, it is not profitable to build houses for poor people. That’s the challenge.”The opposition National party’s finance spokeswoman Amy Adams said the foreign buyer’s ban was “xenophobic”, and said it had already sent a chill through the international business investment community, with business confidence falling to its lowest level since 2008.“The government has put this up as some sort of panacea to the issue of housing affordability in New Zealand, but the evidence is that it is likely to make the problem far worse,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/739015d7934b1ba498f8be3af409c89aab35ccb1/0_0_4034_2421/master/4034.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=724390cf7eda2ec1263db7854581bba3","title":"wednesday briefing ceo pay soars as working wages flatline","story":"Hello – it’s Warren Murray bringing the big news to your inbox.Pay for chief executives at Britain’s largest listed companies rose more than six times faster than wages in the wider workforce last year.

Photograph:  David DaviesPA There are sweeping changes to the Leaving Cert grading system for the 58,550 students who receive their results on Wednesday.The old familiar grading system – A1, B2, C3 – is replaced with grades from H1 to H8 (for higher-level subjects) and from O1 to O8 (for ordinary level subjects).In all, there are a total of eight grades available this year at higher and ordinary level separated by margins of 10 per cent.This compares to 14 under the old system, typically separated by margins of 5 per cent.For example, a student at higher level who scores between 90 and 100 per cent will score a H1 under the new system, while a student who scores between 80 and 90 per cent will receive a H2.One of the biggest changes is an old E grade is no longer an automatic fail: under the new system students get 37 points for grades between 30-39 per cent (a H7 under the new system).These changes are aimed at taking some of the heat out of the “points race” and easing some of the pressure on students. Under the old system, the majority of grades were separated by just 5 per cent, equating to an additional five CAO points.This caused heartbreak for many students who failed to qualify for their chosen college course because they missed out by such a narrow margin.The new system should also ensure fewer students miss out on courses due to random selection, based on trials using the new marking scheme.The changes have already resulted in more students opting to take subjects at higher level, given the risk of “failing” is reduced.Some may question whether the new system is simply a “dumbing down” of the old one.However, the State Examinations Commission insists there has been no change in the exam standards of the Leaving Cert. Rather the change relates to how candidates’ results are reported to them through the new grading system.Critics also say the system could end up rewarding some students with relatively poor performances ahead of those who fared better.For example, a student who gets 59 per cent will be awarded the same points as one who gets 50 per cent under the new system.In any case, the new system has the support of the majority of teacher, parent and student groups.Groups such as the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals have advised students that while results day is an important chapter in their lives, it does not determine the rest of it.“Even if you haven’t received the results you would have preferred, the option is there to repeat, or to pursue further education as an alternative or a stepping stone to third-level study at college,” said Clive Byrne, the association’s director.Full coverage of this year\u0027s Leaving Cert results and 2017 CAO offers"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3596928.1534321867!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"adele was first to spot her best friend s postpartum psychosis","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAdele: “I was on the phone, FaceTiming her, and she was the first one to detect what I might have,” Laura Dockrill says. Photograph: AxelleBauer-GriffinFilmMagicGettyAdele’s best friend has credited the singer with being the first person to spot that she had postpartum psychosis, a mental illness that affects one in 1,000 mothers and can lead to hallucinations after childbirth.“She recognised it in me. I was on the phone, FaceTiming her, and she was the first one to detect what I might have,” Laura Dockrill, a poet, author and illustrator who met the singer when they were both students at the Brit School of Performing Arts, told the BBC.Dockrill, who gave birth to a baby boy earlier this year, says she has experienced insomnia, delusions, suspiciousness and paranoia. “The last six months can only be described as hell, it’s been the worst time of my life.” She has written a blog post to share her experience with other mothers facing the same difficulties. Adele called Dockrill’s story intimate and heartbreaking when she shared it on social media this week.On her blog Dockrill writes about a “horrific” labour that her doctor believes may have marked the start of her illness, adding that after she brought she son home she felt as if “I had pushed out my personality as well as a baby”.She also writes that she thought about suicide. “I was begging my sister to let me go, I was begging my mum to let me go. I have never had those thoughts before in my life and no history of mental illness, this completely took me by surprise and threw me against the rocks.”Dockrill, who says that her skin turned pale and that she couldn’t eat or drink and began to have anxiety attacks, asked her partner to send her photographs of herself with friends and family, so she could remember who she was.“Even though postnatal depression and the psychosis are both treatable, even when my doctor said I would 100 per cent recover, I remember thinking, ‘Maybe others do but not me, this is me forever’.”After two weeks in hospital, Dockrill says is now “happy, confident and strong” after receiving medical care and support from her family. She credits talking about her condition with being a huge part of her recovery. “I was constantly searching for any stories that offered me hope or salvation in this dark and testing time so that’s why I’ve shared this,” she says about her blog post.On Monday Adele tweeted to praise her friend and share a link to the blog, saying that Dockrill “has written the most intimate, witty, heartbreaking and articulate piece about her experience of becoming a new mum and being diagnosed with postpartum psychosis.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

She was sacked the following year. Ms Walker, who was joined at her tribunal by BBC journalist Carrie Gracie and Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society chief executive, is believed to have been earning a base salary of £425,000 a year that would have ballooned to over £1 million once bonus earnings had been accounted for. In a witness statement given to the tribunal Ms Walker said that in 2014 large pay increases were being given to board members in a bid to stop them from from leaving the company. This included increases to the then general counsel, Alistair Asher, and chief external affairs officer, Nick Folland, who were paid £550,000, while she and the then chief strategy planning officer, Paula Kerrigan, were offered a salary of around £400,000.The Co-op vehemently denies the allegations brought by Sam WalkerIn 2016 Ms Walker said she warned the then chief executive, Richard Pennycook, that “it was not looking good” from an equal pay perspective.She said: “I told him that I thought the Co-op had an equal pay problem which not only exposed the business to legal claims, but was inconsistent with the Co-op’s declared values.”After highlighting the potential issues she suggested taking more holiday to allow her pro-rata pay to be equivalent to her male colleagues. Instead it is claimed she was offered a new, reduced role. During the negotiations her daughter suffered a brain injury and Ms Walker was signed off sick in March 2016. She was told her employment had been terminated at the start of April.She claims she was “not treated equally in terms of pay with two male colleagues in the Co-op’s executive team and that I was victimised and discriminated (and ultimately dismissed) when I raised concerns about this”..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}I cannot leave that career, which I now accept is damaged beyond repair by simply making this claim, without trying to put something rightSam WalkerResponding to the accusations the Co-op vehemently denies the allegations brought by Ms Walker, arguing that her dismissal was related to her work performance alone.A Co-op spokesman said: “We do not accept that Sam Walker was discriminated against or treated detrimentally, and intend to fully and robustly defend the various claims brought by Sam.”Andrew Burns QC, for the Co-op, suggested to Ms Walker that she was “thrown into the deep end” at a time when the business was struggling.Ms Walker argued in her statement that the case is not about money but “right and wrong”.“I’ve grown up in a man’s world,” she said. “I’ve had a 28-year career with mainly just men around the table once I reached senior positions and all the time I have been conscious that they have been paid more.“I cannot leave that career, which I now accept is damaged beyond repair by simply making this claim, without trying to put something right.“All the cases that come to court are class actions.

caused by billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases injected into the atmosphere, mainly over the last century - has come on top of those small shifts, and today threatens to overwhelm them.Teasing apart the influence of carbon pollution and natural variation has long bedevilled scientists trying to quantify the impact of climate change on cyclones, droughts, floods and other forms of extreme weather.Sevellec and his colleagues tackled the problem in a different way.First, they focused on the natural fluctuations that - for most climate scientists - are noise obscuring the climate change fingerprint.People bathe during a heatwave in Stockholm, SwedenSecond, they used a streamlined statistical approach rather than the comprehensive climate models that generate most long-term forecasts.We developed a system for predicting interannual - or short-term - natural variations in climate, Sevellec said.For the period 2018-2022, we found an anomaly equivalent to the impact of anthropogenic warming.Natural warming, in other words, will have about the same impact as manmade climate change over the next five years.The likelihood of a marine heatwave or other ocean warming events is predicted to increase by 150 percent.The new method - dubbed PROCAST, for PRObabilistic foreCAST - was tested against past temperature records and proved at least as accurate as standard models.Heatwave | Winners and LosersIt can be run in seconds on a laptop, rather than requiring weeks of computing time on a super-computer.This opens up the possibility of doing climate forecasts to more researchers, especially in countries that don\u0027t have easy access to super-computers, Sevellec said.The researchers intend to adapt their system to make regional predictions, and - in addition to temperature - to estimate rainfall and drought trends.The Paris climate treaty calls for capping global warming at well below two degrees Celsius, and 1.5 C if deemed feasible.On current trends, however, Earth is on track to heat up by twice that much before the end of the century.Please review our commenting policyParliament Square cars could be banned, says UK\u0026#39s most senior police officer as terror suspect held in custodySalih Khater: Westminster terror suspect migrated from Sudan, studied accountancy in Coventry and loved Celine Dion Genoa bridge collapse: \u0026#39I was the last car behind those who died\u0026#39- survivors describe how motorway disintegrated before their eyesYoung couple and their seven-year-old son named among 38 killed in Genoa bridge collapse Why did the Genoa bridge collapse -

However, a smaller but significant proportion of orders at each of the time slots, including before 2pm, were not forecast for delivery the subsequent day, meaning that a significant proportion of Prime labelled items were not available for delivery the next day.A screen grab taken from the Amazon website of the company\u0026#39s help and customer service pageBecause consumers were likely to understand that, so long as they did not order too late or for Sunday delivery, all Prime-labelled items would be available for delivery the next day with the One-Day Delivery option, when a significant proportion of Prime-labelled items were not available for delivery by the subsequent day with One-Day Delivery, we concluded that the ad was misleading.An Amazon spokesman said: Amazon Prime offers fantastic benefits to members including One-Day Delivery on millions of eligible items at no extra cost.The expected delivery date is shown before an order is placed and throughout the shopping journey and we work relentlessly to meet this date. The overwhelming majority of One-Day Delivery orders are delivered when promised.A small proportion of orders missed the delivery promise last year during a period of extreme weather that impacted all carriers across the UK, and we provided support to impacted camazonustomers at the time.Please review our commenting policyParliament Square cars could be banned, says UK\u0026#39s most senior police officer as terror suspect held in custodySalih Khater: Westminster terror suspect migrated from Sudan, studied accountancy in Coventry and loved Celine Dion Genoa bridge collapse: \u0026#39I was the last car behind those who died\u0026#39- survivors describe how motorway disintegrated before their eyesYoung couple and their seven-year-old son named among 38 killed in Genoa bridge collapse Why did the Genoa bridge collapse -

There is no question of stopping or getting tired on the way, Modi said. Please review our commenting policyParliament Square cars could be banned, says UK\u0026#39s most senior police officer as terror suspect held in custodySalih Khater: Westminster terror suspect migrated from Sudan, studied accountancy in Coventry and loved Celine Dion Genoa bridge collapse: \u0026#39I was the last car behind those who died\u0026#39- survivors describe how motorway disintegrated before their eyesYoung couple and their seven-year-old son named among 38 killed in Genoa bridge collapse Why did the Genoa bridge collapse -

The closures, which will affect stores across the UK and Ireland, are part of a company voluntary arrangement it has launched in a bid to cut costs, after years of declining sales and profits under previous owner Wesfarmers. The Australian group bought Homebase for £340m in 2016, but sold it to restructuring specialist Hilco for just £1 earlier this year, describing it as a “disappointing” investment.On Tuesday, Homebase said it would be closing the 42 branches in late 2018 and early 2019, and said “every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible”, although it expects to make 1,500 staff redundant. Usdaw national officer David Gill\u0026nbspsaid: “Homebase staff feared the worst when the company was sold for just £1 following the disastrous ownership by Wesfarmers.“I am seeking urgent clarification from Hilco about their long-term plan to turn the company around.

In a statement, they said: “We have always believed passionately that our son and other children in his position should have equal rights to be able to go to school and receive the support they need to achieve the best possible outcomes.L\u0027s autism means that he will grow up in a world where he will face challenges and adversity throughout his life. School should be somewhere he can go without fear of discrimination or exclusion for actions which he has no control over.Knowing that one of the key rules that prevented that has now been found to be unlawful is of great comfort to us, and we hope, many other families.The case, which was an appeal from a first-tier tribunal made in August last year, was supported by the National Autistic Society (NAS)\u0026nbspand the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).Melanie Field, executive director of the EHRC, said: “We are delighted with this judgment which will require schools to make reasonable adjustments to try to prevent or manage challenging behaviour and justify that any exclusion in these circumstances is proportionate.”She added: “Exclusions should only happen as a last resort, when schools have tried every other practical solution. But the loophole meant that there was not enough incentive for schools to make necessary reasonable adjustments. And some schools resort far too quickly to exclusions.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders,\u0026nbspsaid: “Schools do everything they can to support children with special educational needs, including those young people who display challenging behaviour.”But he added that a lack of funding from the government made it harder. “Many schools have had to cut back on the inidual support they provide to pupils because of the need to make significant budget savings and this makes it more difficult to provide early intervention to prevent behaviour problems from escalating,” Mr Barton said.“This tribunal ruling makes it even more important that the government improves funding urgently.”UK news in picturesPolice arrest a man after he crashed a car into security barriers outside the Houses of ParliamentCommunities Secretary James Brokenshire today launched a £100 million pound government fund to end rough sleeping in England within the next decade.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/19/15/cwacom03.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-4371251  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1.

Post-Hook and Aladdin, Robin Williams was on a role. One of his standout performances was as Mrs. Doubtfire, the father-turned-drag-housekeeper. As a premise, dressing your lead male as a woman wasn’t exactly new (see Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie), so the filmmakers ran the risk of it all seeming like an overdone joke.

turned the lush green landscape yellow.Archaeologists at Historic England have been taking to the skies to\u0026nbspstudy “cropmarks” which have appeared in Britain’s parched fields.The marks expose\u0026nbspthe remnants of historic buildings because the grass or crop\u0026nbspabove them grows\u0026nbspdifferently compared to plants in the surrounding soil.The resulting differences in colour or height of crops and grass can reveal the layouts of buried ditches or walls which once marked out settlements, field boundaries or funerary monuments.Among the new discoveries in recent months are two Neolithic “cursus” monuments near Clifton Reynes, Milton Keynes, one of which has been hidden until this year under a medieval bank which is gradually being ploughed away.The long rectangles, thought to be the remains of paths or processional ways, are among the oldest monument types in the country, dating from 3600 to 3000BC.Other recent discoveries including an Iron Age round settlement at St Ive and a prehistoric settlement with concentric ditches at Lansallos in Cornwall.Historic sites across UK exposed by heatwaveCrop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall,

very hot weather has provided the perfect conditions for our aerial archaeologists to ‘see beneath the soil’ as\u0026nbspcropmarks\u0026nbspare much better defined when the soil has less moisture.“The discovery of ancient farms, settlements and Neolithic\u0026nbspcursus\u0026nbspmonuments is exciting.“The exceptional weather has opened up whole areas at once rather than just one or two fields and it has been fascinating to see so many traces of our past graphically revealed.”Experts have also spotted Iron Age square burial mounds or barrows in Pocklington, Yorkshire, a Bronze Age burial mound and a ditch and series of pits that could mark a land boundary in Scropton, Derbyshire, and a settlement or cemetery at Stoke by Clare, Suffolk.A Roman farm has emerged in a field of grass at Bicton, Devon, while prehistoric farms have been found in Stogumber and an ancient enclosure has been revealed in Churchstanton, both in Somerset.New details of the lost Elizabethan buildings and gardens associated with Tixall Hall in Staffordshire can be seen through the drought, revealing buried foundations of the hall built in 1555 and a new hall started during the First World War, but demolished in 1926.Features of the already protected prehistoric ceremonial landscape near Eynsham, Oxfordshire, that have not been visible for years can also be seen, including a circle of pits.Historic England uses aerial photography of cropmarks to produce archaeological maps which help to assess the significance of buried remains and can be used to make decisions about protecting them from development or damage caused by ploughing.Helen Winton, Historic England aerial investigation and mapping manager,\u0026nbspdescribed the\u0026nbspheatwave-enabled discoveries as “very exciting”.The last “exceptional year”\u0026nbspfor similar findings was 2011, when more than 1,500 sites were discovered, she said.Damian Grady, Historic England aerial reconnaissance manager, added: “This has been one of my busiest summers in 20 years of flying and it is has been very rewarding making discoveries in areas that do not normally reveal cropmarks.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister

If parliament could pass laws to nationalise banks during the financial crash in a matter of days, then we can secure the legislation to allow people their right to a final say within weeks,” he will tell people.Brexit: Half of Britons want final say in no-deal scenario, poll findsI want to leave the EU but I support a Final Say on the Brexit dealNorthern Irish students’ organisation calls for vote on Brexit dealAs a student leader, here’s why I’m backing a Final Say on BrexitYour ideas and suggestions for the Final Say campaignThe remarks from Sir Vince come after The Independent’s petition – calling for a Final Say on any Brexit deal Theresa May returns from Brussels with – topped 600,000 signatures.But in an evaluation of the 2016 referendum, the Electoral Commission recommended that\u0026nbsplegislation should be clear at least six months before polling day.It took seven months for parliament to sign off the last referendum legislation in an act of parliament, meaning MPs would have to work\u0026nbspat an extraordinarily fast pace to pass fresh legislation\u0026nbspif they were to go ahead with\u0026nbspthe recommendations of the Electoral Commission.At the rally in Bristol on Saturday, the senior Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who became the latest high-profile politician to back calls for a People’s Vote, will join Sir Vince.Ahead of the visit, he added: “People in the southwest – from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucester – will be hit hard by a bad Brexit deal.“People’s jobs, security, the local economy and the produce which makes us so proud of the southwest are all under threat from Brexit. The government are making a mess out of Brexit – but it is not a done deal.\u0026nbsp“I am delighted to come back to Bristol on 11 August\u0026nbspto join the hundreds of people calling for a People’s Vote. Whether you voted leave or remain in the referendum, the Liberal Democrats believe it is your right to have the final say on the Brexit deal through a People’s Vote.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union His intervention comes\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspa major poll from the People’s Vote campaign, which revealed that half of British people want a referendum on membership of the\u0026nbspEuropean Union\u0026nbspif the Brexit talks collapse and the country faces the prospect of a no deal.The survey by\u0026nbspYouGov, which included a weighted sample of more than 10,000 people, found just a quarter would want\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto be given the final decision.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/08/07/ap-ilhan-omar-somalian-american-politician-.jpg","title":"ilhan omar minnesota primary election democrat results congress somalia us refugee","story":"Created with Sketch.Former refugee emigrated to the US at the age of 12Click to followThe Independent USIlhan Omar is a member of the Minnesota House of RepresentativesIlhan Omar is poised to become the first Somali-American elected to US Congress.\u0026nbspMs Omar made history on Tuesday by winning a Democratic primary in Minnesota\u0027s 5th Congressional District.Republican Keith Ellison left the seat to run for state attorney general.

And in Connecticut, the party nominated a candidate who could become the first black woman from the state to serve in Congress.\u0026nbspStill, Democrats in Minnesota also backed a national party leader who is facing accusations of domestic violence. He has denied the allegations, yet they threaten to undercut enthusiasm in his state and beyond.\u0026nbspOn the other side, Trump tightened his grip on the modern-day Republican Party as the turbulent 2018 primary season lurched towards its finale. A one-time Trump critic, former two-term Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, lost a comeback attempt he was expected to win.\u0026nbspAll but 10 states picked their candidates for November’s general election by the time the day’s final votes were counted. While the full political battlefield isn’t quite set, the stakes are clear: Democrats are working to topple Republican control of Congress and governors’ offices across the nation.\u0026nbspFour states held primaries on Tuesday: Vermont, Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Kansas’ gubernatorial primary, which was held last week, was finalised when Colyer conceded defeat.\u0026nbspIn Minnesota, Republican County Commissioner Jeff Johnson defeated Pawlenty, who once called Trump “unhinged and unfit” and was hoping to regain his old post. In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker, endorsed just this week by Trump, won the right to seek a third term.\u0026nbspThe president’s pick for Kansas governor, Secretary of State Kris Kobach, scored a delayed victory against Jeff Colyer, who became the first incumbent governor to fall this season.\u0026nbspIn Vermont, Democrat Christine Hallquist won the Democratic nomination in her quest to become the nation’s first transgender governor. The former chief executive of Vermont Electric Cooperative bested a field of four Democrats that included a 14-year-old.\u0026nbspWhile she made history on Tuesday, Hallquist faces a difficult path to the governor’s mansion. Republican incumbent Phil Scott remains more popular with Democrats than members of his own party in the solidly liberal state.\u0026nbspVermont Democrats also nominated Senator\u0026nbspBernie Sanders, who hasn’t ruled out a second presidential run in 2020, for a third term in the Senate. The 76-year-old democratic socialist won the Democratic nomination, but he is expected to turn it down and run as an independent.\u0026nbspDemocrats appeared particularly motivated in Wisconsin, where eight candidates lined up for the chance to take on Walker.\u0026nbspWalker’s strong anti-union policies made him a villain to Democrats long before Trump’s rise. State schools chief Tony Evers, who has clashed with Walker at times, won the Democratic nomination and will take on Walker this fall.\u0026nbspOnce a target of Trump criticism, Walker gained the president’s endorsement in a tweet Monday night calling him “a tremendous Governor who has done incredible things for that Great State.”\u0026nbspTrump also starred, informally at least, in Wisconsin’s Senate primaries as Republicans try to deny Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin a second term.\u0026nbspJahana Hayes could be Connecticut\u0027s first black Democrat in CongressMeet the former refugee poised to be first Somali-American in CongressA candidate in Wisconsin primary forced to prove he is aliveLongtime state lawmaker Leah Vukmir, who was backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, won the Republican primary, even after struggling to explain footage recently unearthed from 2016 in which she called Trump “offensive to everyone.”\u0026nbspTuesday’s primaries served as a test of Democratic enthusiasm in the upper Midwest, a region that has long been associated with liberal politics but has been trending red. Trump won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point in 2016, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the state since 1984.\u0026nbspIt was much the same in Minnesota, where Trump lost by less than 3 percentage points in a state that hasn’t backed a Republican presidential contender since 1972.\u0026nbspNearly twice as many Minnesota Democrats as Republicans cast ballots in their parties’ respective gubernatorial primaries.\u0026nbspPawlenty had been considered the heavy favorite in a two-person Republican contest for his old job. But he struggled to adapt to a GOP that had changed drastically since he left office in 2011 and flamed out early in a 2012 presidential bid.\u0026nbspThe former two-term governor strained to live down his October 2016 comment that Trump was “unhinged and unfit for the presidency,” remarks that incensed many Republican voters in Minnesota and beyond. Johnson, his underfunded opponent, circulated Pawlenty’s critique far and wide, telling voters that he was a steadfast supporter of the president.\u0026nbspJohnson will face Democratic Representative Tim Walz, who won a three-way race for his party’s nomination.\u0026nbspThree Minnesota women won Senate nominations, including incumbent Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith.\u0026nbspSmith, who had been appointed to replace disgraced Democrat Al Franken, will face Republican state Senator\u0026nbspKarin Housley, ensuring a woman will hold the seat once held by Franken, who left Congress amid allegations of sexual misconduct towards women.\u0026nbspNationwide, a record number of women are running this year for governor and Congress.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, a new scandal threatened to dampen Democratic enthusiasm.\u0026nbspRepresentative Keith Ellison, the Democratic National Committee’s deputy chairman, captured his party’s nomination in the race to become the state’s attorney general. That’s after Ellison’s candidacy was rocked by allegations over the weekend of domestic violence amid a broader national outcry against sexual misconduct by powerful men in business, entertainment and politics.\u0026nbspEllison has denied a former girlfriend’s allegations that he dragged her off a bed while screaming obscenities during a 2016 relationship she said was plagued by “narcissistic abuse.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesA large section of the Morandi viaduct upon which the A10 motorway runs collapsed in Genoa, Italy.

Muslims in New South Wales and Victoria are three times more likely than other groups to be convicted of crimes, he claimed.\u0026nbsp“We have black African Muslim gangs terrorising Melbourne, we have Isis-sympathising Muslims trying to go overseas to try and fight for Isis and while all Muslims are not terrorists, certainly all terrorists these days are Muslims.“So why would anyone want to bring more of them here?”He went on to state\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspmigrates should learn the English language and embrace Australian values.“Ethnocultural ersity ... has been allowed to rise to dangerous levels in many suburbs, he said.In direct response, self-segregation, including white flight from poorer inner-urban areas, has become the norm.World news in picturesA large section of the Morandi viaduct upon which the A10 motorway runs collapsed in Genoa, Italy.

Trade expert predicts second Brexit referendum by end of 2018Calls for a positive alternative vision of Brexit have been growing among Tories since Mrs May\u0027s Cabinet agreed her compromise plan in an away-day summit at her Chequers country residence last month.The agreed plan, including a common rulebook covering trade in goods, led to the resignations of senior minister Boris Johnson and David Davis.Members of the European Research Group are understood to favour a free-trade deal similar to that recently agreed between the EU and Canada.Such a model could allow tariff free trade without the UK remaining part of the EU\u0027s single market or customs union.The paper is expected to say that Britain could thrive on the basis of World Trade Organisation rules if Brussels refuses a Canada-style deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg is understood to be drawing up new Brexit proposals in contrast to Theresa May (Image: )Former Cabinet minister Lord Lilley, a member of the European Research Group, yesterday insisted Mrs May\u0027s plan was moribund and an alternative was needed.A trade deal would be the best outcome, but the Chequers plan is moribund, he wrote in a newspaper article.No deal is likely and would be a good second best, making a better deal possible later.Lord Lilley added: Far from falling off a cliff, World Trade Organisation terms are designed to ensure that members can trade without discrimination.The EU will have to offer us the most favoured nation terms its other leading trading partners enjoy.

EU WARNED: Italy deputy PM Salvini issues STERN warning to Brussels \u0026ldquoIf so, they could become the largest or the second-largest group in the Parliament.Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law in Paris, said: Europe may be on the verge of a more trans-national form of democracy \u0026ndash one that is polarised around very basic pro and anti-EU positions.Under current spitzenkandidat rules, the process used to select the Commission president, the largest political group in the parliament selects the candidate who becomes the EU\u0027s most senior official.The current incumbent, Jean-Claude Juncker, is expected to stand down and a new Commission president appointed after the May 2019 elections.While Mr Juncker\u0027s EPP are once again likely to become the largest group in Parliament, a significant increase in populist MEPs will cause his predecessor a headache.Because of the law-making process in Brussels, Parliament has the power to veto any legislatory proposals put forward by the Commission.MEPs even have the opportunity to reject any amendments tabled by member states, which thus far have been reasonably sucessful in keeping populists at bay.During the Parliament\u0027s current term, eurosceptic forces have been kept at defeated in Germany and France.However, Brussels has been a hotbed for anti-establishment success with 151 of the current 751 MEPs identifying as eurosceptic.If the number of populist can grow in the next make-up of Parliament, they will carry significant power in the decision-making process and if teamed up could even take control of the Commission.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMatteo Salvini is just one right-winger who can rock EU politics at next year\u0027s election (Image: )In July, Mr Salvini, Italy\u0026rsquos deputy prime minister and leader of right-wingers League, pledged to \u0026ldquoliberate Europeans in the same way he has with Italians, spearheading an anti-establishment coalition with the Five Star Movement.Addressing an outdoor rally in northern Italy, the populist heavyweight proclaimed his and League\u0026rsquos idealism is the \u0026ldquolast hope for this Europe to stay alive, promising to produce a similar movement in the heart of Brussels politics.Mr Salvini told the Pontida crowd: \u0026ldquoI am thinking about a League of the Leagues of Europe, bringing together all the free and sovereign movements that want to defend their people and their borders.He said League would be at the front of Italian politics for the next 30 years and he will unleash his mantra of European politics at the next vote to elect MEPs in May 2019.

The UK is the second-biggest export market for German car manufacturers.Customs duties of \u0026pound2 billion a year would be added to the cost of German cars bought by British consumers under a no-deal Brexit.Last year, 950,000 cars made by Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz were registered in the UK as part of the \u0026pound20 billion worth of German cars that were imported.Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier are working to strike a deal but EU members fear the worst (Image: )BelgiumA no-deal Brexit will hurt the Belgian economy seriously, according to shock warnings from its finance minister Johan Van Overtveldt.The country will lose around 42,000 in the Flanders region alone as havoc is wreaked across the small nation.Mr Van Overtveldt said: Belgium is the fourth exporter, in nominal amounts, into the UK, on a par with France which is a much bigger country. And so, if Brexit goes the wrong way, in terms of the hard Brexit, it will hurt the Belgian economy seriously.We\u0026rsquore talking about thousands and thousands of jobs depending on the business done with the UK.ItalyRome could have to contribute an extra \u0026pound900 million a year into Brussels\u0027 budget coffers in order to make up the shortfall left by Brexit.The country\u0027s farmers are also concerned that any restriction in free trade between the Italy and the UK would devastate their industry.Roberto Moncalvo, president of Italian farming union Coldiretti said the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the EU in March 2019 would \u0026ldquoweaken Italy\u0026rsquos farming industry and export trade.He warned Italian agriculture \u0026ldquocan\u0026rsquot pay the price of Brexit.They fear an estimated cut of \u0026euro2.7billion (\u0026pound2.3billion) to the budget of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), something which could heavily impact 800,000 Italian farms.

Bearing in mind that those who self-harm are at much greater risk of suicide, this is not a problem to be taken lightly.For some young people the act of cutting, or otherwise inflicting pain on themselves, is a way of relieving — albeit temporarily — mental pain and torment by converting it into something more visible and tangible.It’s a way of relieving tension and an attempt to clarify a confusing mental swirl into something that is easier to understand in its simplicity. It’s also a way of punishing yourself.So why the sudden, huge, increase in girls taking this path?Psychiatrists commenting on the research blamed a combination of academic stresses and body-image issues triggered by the use of social media.There’s no doubt that social media, which barely existed ten years ago, has, along with all the good stuff, brought with it a whole new set of pressures.Women’s appearances have always been scrutinised, but that unique equation of the selfie generation plus Photoshop plus the sheer variety of ways to propel your image out into the world has created a series of impossible standards.It’s also created a whole generation that is convinced that everything is going brilliantly for everyone else.When teenagers look at their friend’s social media feeds they see apparently perfect lives, bodies, homes and jobs.And then they feel inadequate.There are other pressures: Pressure to do well in exams have amazing friendships and be brilliantly successful. And, for some people, the relief to those pressures is to hurt themselves, which is surely the saddest and one of the most difficult problems any parent can deal with.After all, it’s our natural instinct to protect our children from harm. But what can we do when the harm comes from within themselves?All teenage kids have intensely difficult phases. And the pressures at school can feel unbearable.If someone doesn’t like you, it feels like the end of the world. If you fail an exam you can feel doomed to failure. School feels like it will never end.Our job is to try to help our children get perspective.Despite the downsides of excessive social media being well documented, it seems that most young people would rather end up with mental health problems than give it up. So maybe they need a helping hand.We need to talk more to our kids about the reality of social media — and limit their time on it.And we need to coax them out of their screen-sized comfort zone.One of the best things kids can do is some volunteering.That way they can meet kids from different backgrounds and people with real problems — such as children born with disabilities who are still making the most of their life.Sport is also brilliant for getting kids to enjoy being part of something bigger than their bedroom, and for celebrating their bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like.The big question is, how can we get them to talk about their feelings, instead of engraving them into their skin until they draw blood?Be kind, patient but determined and, most importantly, we need to talk to our children, ask them how they are feeling — and listen to the answers without judgment.If they won’t talk to you, find someone else they can talk to, either a family friend or even a counsellor if you’re worried about self-harm.But the Government also needs to invest more money into care.Less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on children’s mental health, and most of that is on acute care rather than preventative or early intervention services.That needs to change.Most of all, we need to accept that there is a problem and find ways to address it. Because if we don’t, things are going to get much, much worse.SURELY only those with the hardest of hearts could complain about the affection shown by Zara and Mike Tindall, who are frequently photographed kissing, hugging and looking generally happy and totally loved-up.Given they have survived challenging personal losses and have two young children, it’s pretty much a miracle they are so happy.How could anyone wish them anything but well?DID you see the Kardashian and Jenner sisters at Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party?What is most striking – other than them all being drop-dead gorgeous, of course – is that they each have totally different body types.I guess what they DO have in common is an unlimited budget for personal trainers and chefs . . . plus the fact that looking this good is their full-time job.His crime was horrific and he deserved to be dealt with.His punishment was to be beheaded and his body crucified and displayed in Mecca.A beheading and crucifixion in this century?There are instances when I do believe that the death penalty is just, but this method is just barbaric.THE latest advice from fertility specialists to women who want to “delay motherhood” is for them to freeze their eggs in their early twenties.At the moment, the vast majority of women who go through the procedure do so in their late thirties – by which time they have little chance of success. But who is going to freeze their eggs in their twenties?I was fortunate to meet the right man in my twenties – and had children once I was married because I wanted to have a family.But plenty of women don’t meet the right partner that early in life, or simply don’t want to have children until they are older.One reason for that is that they want to have a career – and they know babies can seriously damage their chances of promotion or even a pay rise.But the solution is not for women to freeze their eggs.The real solution is a shift in the division of labour between mothers and fathers.So long as the children are not the sole responsibility of just one person in the family, things can work well.If both partners are equally involved, nobody has to totally compromise their life and put their career on hold.As things stand, no wonder women are putting off motherhood. But if more men pulled their weight, maybe women wouldn’t have to worry about freezing their eggs.WHEN you look at photos of the 200 travellers who have descended on the village of Long Ditton in Surrey, you can see why local police sparked fury by telling residents who want to evict them to have empathy instead.The police force tweeted: “Consider for a second how upsetting it would be, being uprooted every few days.”But the photos show piles of rubbish and damaged property.In one, a child is sitting on an adult’s lap while he drives a car around the village green. And I dread to think about the specifics of the toilet situation.What is needed is not empathy but police action.SOME high-profile, wealthy parents – such as Sting, Elton John and Simon Cowell – make a point of saying they won’t leave their fortunes to their children for fear it will ruin their lives.Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has taken a different tack.She says she will leave her £16million fortune to her two sons . . . IF they get a job.I applaud the sentiment. But if you really want your children to develop a work ethic, rather than relying on inherited income, isn’t the key not to tell your kids – and the whole world – in a national newspaper?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Posting on a Tory Whatsapp group she stormed: “Are the power that be determined to add insult to injury after the white paper, Boris, the PM letter and now this.”Marcus Fysh, a Eurosceptic who has called for the PM to go, added: “Uttterly moronic I’m afraid. The sooner this administration is changed the better.”They also hit out over the “Lib Dem Yellow” colour of the mailout – which explains how the Chequers proposal will end free movement, and the rule of the European Court of Justice.Brexit backers argue the PM’s plan to keep Britain in a single market for goods will force the UK to be subject to ECJ rulings for years.

Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire.

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And there was more action in areas that fire when someone feels their personal space is  invaded.In another trial, 1,000 people rated videos of others chatting.Those from films who had the least sleep scored worse for desirability and perceived loneliness.The volunteers also felt more isolated after watching a sleep-deprived person talk.Study leader Prof Matthew Walker, of the University of California, said: “We humans are a social species. Yet sleep deprivation can turn us into social lepers.“The less sleep you get, the less you want to socially interact.“In turn, other people perceive you as more socially repulsive, further increasing the grave social-isolation impact of sleep loss.

Ben was heroic — thank you Ben!“We are convinced we would have been beaten up if it wasn’t for Ben. He stood up for us.“I got bottled and Ben jumped in to defend me. The prosecution said he was homophobic, but we never saw any of that.“If he didn’t like me, or didn’t worry about me or was taunting me, then he wouldn’t have stuck up for me in the first place.“We’re delighted that he’s been cleared. He risked his career for us.“We didn’t want Ben’s career ruined for helping two people who were being attacked.“Just a week before the case the Crown Prosecution Service said they didn’t want us there. I think police and the CPS ignored that it happened to us because we’re gay.”They appeared on Good Morning Britain and sent a message to Stokes after saying he had taken a risk when coming to their aid.Kai said: Id just like to say thank you for what you did. Im so sorry it went down like that, I shouldnt have lasted that long  in the first place.And William added: Thank you as well, it was brilliant what youve done, stuck up for two gay men - you dont really get people out there like that so you definitely did a very good job.Both Kai and 21-year-old student beautician William gave full ­statements to officers after video footage of the Bristol punch-up was handed to The Sun last year.But they were told prosecutors did not want them to give ­evidence, so their account of how they believe Stokes stepped in to ­rescue them was never heard by the jury.They described exactly how the star, cleared at Bristol crown court, selflessly leapt to their rescue.They said he waded in with his fists during the brawl last September only after they were branded “batty boys” and then attacked with the glass bottle.Kai and William said they were out drinking in the city’s popular Clifton Triangle when they got chatting to Stokes outside a nightclub called Mbargo.The pair told how they laughed and joked with the ace about his £695 white Buscemi hi-top trainers while smoking a ­cigarette at 2am.William said: “I was chatting to Ben, but I didn’t know it was him at the time. I laughed at his shoes and he laughed too.”But he and Kai, who describe themselves as openly gay and flamboyant, said they were then targeted with homophobic taunts as they walked away.Kai said: “The other two defendants Ryan Ali and Ryan Hale walked behind us.“We then heard a ‘batty boy’ comment. I turned around and confronted them and was hit in the back with a bottle.“Ben Stokes came across the road to stop it — you can clearly see it on the video.”All-rounder Stokes, 27, had faced jail after knocking out two men during a street brawl following a booze- fuelled night out with team-mate Alex Hales, 29, in Bristol last September.But after a six-day trial, jurors took just 2½ hours to clear him of the charge.In a statement read outside Bristol crown court, his solicitor Paul Lunt said The Sun’s footage of the street fight showed “jurors exactly what happened”.He added: “Today’s verdict represents the end of an 11-month ordeal for Ben during which time he has had to maintain his silence.“The jury’s decision fairly reflects the truth of what happened that night.“Ben had been out with team-mates celebrating an England win. He was minding his own business when he came across two men who were subject to what Ben identified as serious homophobic abuse.“It was only when others came under threat that Ben became physically engaged.“The steps that he took were solely aimed at ensuring the safety of himself and the others present.“In addition to the ext­reme stress placed on Ben and his family by the trial, his intervention that night has already cost Ben the England vice-captaincy, his place on an Ashes tour and his place on a number of other England matches.“The past 11 months have served to highlight just how highly he values his posit­i­on as an England representative. Now the trial is over, he’s keen to get back to cricket being his sole focus.”As the jury delivered its verdict Stokes closed his eyes, rocked forward and pressed his head against the dock’s glass screen.The court heard how the 6ft 2in star stepped in to defend gay pals Kai Barry and William O’Connor outside a Bristol club.He hit two other men but said it was self defence.Stokes was yesterday re­called to the England squad and could regain his place in the team for Saturday’s third Test at Trent Bridge.Avon and Somerset Police said in a statement they had carried out “a thorough independent inv­estigation” into the events.They added: “The jury has concluded the actions of the defendants did not amount to affray and we respect this decision.”The film shows former shopping mall security guard Ali, 28, hitting Kai on the back with a ­bottle before he was laid out by Stokes. The cricketer also KO’d 27-year-old Afghanistan veteran Hale.Both Hale and Ali were also cleared of affray by the court.William said he recalled the moment Ali hit Kai with a bottle in the street and is still shocked.He said: “It was aggressive. It was out of nowhere. We aren’t boys going out looking for trouble. Ben stood up for us and — after a bit of wrestling — knocked them both out.“We got out of there because we could have got hurt.”Kai added: “I thank God every day for Ben being there. God only knows what could have happened if he wasn’t.”Stokes, who left court yesterday hand-in-hand with wife Clare, 28 — mum to their two children — told the trial he was sticking up for Kai and William. But while his defence is backed up by the pair, they were not asked to give evidence in court.William went on: “He went out of his way to stick up for two gay boys he didn’t know rather than leave us at the mercy of two people starting on us.“He stood his ground for us. He stood up for two gay boys and not many people would do that.“I feel really bad it got this far. If I ever did meet Ben again I would thank him for doing what he did — and apologise for laughing at his trainers.”The pair rubbished claims from nightclub bouncer Andrew Cunningham that Stokes had been “spiteful” and “bullied” Kai and William during their exchange outside the club. They said footage of Stokes flicking them a cigarette was “harmless banter”.William said: “From what we experienced, Ben Stokes is not the nasty or homophobic person he was painted as in court. He stood up for two gay boys.“We were just having banter outside the club. Ben was messing around making gestures, but I have banter with my friends like that.“The police said he was making hand gestures at me, but I get that a lot and I’m still friends with these sorts of people.“My friends do it as well, it’s taking the p***, but it’s not like a bad p***, we clearly didn’t take offence to it.“If it was that bad and he didn’t really like us that much, then he wouldn’t have stuck up for us in the first place.”The six-day trial had also been told that Stokes was “aggressive” and had “lost control” before hitting Hale.William said: “On the video it looks aggressive. But he only did it because of the homophobic abuse — and because Kai had been hit with a bottle.“Ben is a hero for doing what he did. If he wasn’t there, we’d be in hospital.”  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If immigration can be successfully controlled and reduced, this increase is likely to continue.”The official figures separately revealed the number of zero-hours contracts in use has fallen by 104,000 over the past year to 780,000.It marks the first substantial fall recorded by the ONS since it began tracking the figures in 2000.TUC general secretary Frances o’Grady said: “Bosses are finally getting the message that zero-hours contracts are legalised exploitation.”Vote for Brexit and you’d start a recession the likes of which you couldn’t imagine, they said. Well, two years later, Britain’s unemployment figures are at their lowest in more than 40 years.Not exactly plague and pestilence.But as Remoaners rev up their second referendum campaign, it’s worth remembering that it’s exactly the same people that ran Project Fear in the run-up to the 2016 vote.And each of their predictions has turned out to be absolute rubbish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Princess Diana.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It comes in response to yesterday\u0027s suspected terror attack when a car was driven into barriers outside the Houses of Parliament. Asked if the physical security around Parliament should be strengthened, Mr Khan said: I\u0027ve been an advocate for a while now of part-pedestrianising Parliament Square, but making sure we don\u0027t lose the wonderful thing about our democracy which is people having access to parliamentarians, people being able to lobby Parliament, visitors being able to come and visit Parliament.  The Mayor said he supported using creative design to keep buildings safe from hostile vehicles. He said: You\u0027ll have seen around Whitehall barriers which don\u0027t look like barriers because they\u0027ve been designed in a way to look attractive and not unattractive. Mr Khan said he wanted to part-pedestrianise the Square in a way that still made the area look attractive. He conceded: I think there\u0027d be all sorts of challenges with doing the whole square because it is a thoroughfare for cars, vehicles, commercial deliveries going through London.  So it\u0027s possible to have a design solution that meets the objectives... in relation to keeping our buildings and our people as safe as we can do, but also not losing what\u0027s wonderful about our city which is a vibrant democracy and people can walk around our city, cycle around our city, safely. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick also backed the idea as a way to prevent such attacks. Since the Westminster Bridge attack in March last year, Ms Dick said there had been an increase in the number of armed officers and barriers in place to protect the capital\u0027s political heart. Discussions between parliamentary authorities, security agencies, the police and London\u0027s mayor will no doubt take place about whether the site should be further pedestrianised, she said.

The fragrant wife of convicted perjurer and former Tory deputy chairman Sir Jeffrey is still beloved, three decades later, for bringing a cup of tea to the press pack gathered outside their Cambridgeshire vicarage during one of her husband\u0027s many scandals. That someone hounded and pursued by the forces of Fleet Street should be so hospitable was considered remarkable, even heroic. It bought her considerable goodwill, not just because a small village in Cambridgeshire is bereft of places to buy tea but also because, when on a job miles from anywhere, bored and stood outside in all weathers, it is a civilising pleasure to drink from china rather than Styrofoam. It humanises those on all sides - if hunter and hunted both drink tea, they think the other can\u0027t be all bad. It is a moment of peace and acknowledgement of the other\u0027s tribulations, like Christmas Day football between enemies in World War One. It doesn\u0027t end the war, but it\u0027s a nice thought.  In 2007, footballer Teddy Sheringham performed the same feat when his then-girlfriend Danielle Lloyd was in the Celebrity Big Brother house and embroiled in a race row with Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty.  Only he did it half-naked.   And so it was that this weekend former Foreign Secretary and habitual-utterer-of-nasty-things Boris Johnson \u0027did a Mary\u0027, as it is known by some, and produced a tray of tea for the photographers gathered outside his country home in Oxfordshire.  There is a lot that can be gleaned from a person\u0027s tea habits, and even more from a tray produced for others. While gazing enviously at Teddy\u0027s abdomen, you will I am sure have noticed he carried a set of matching mugs, minimalist aluminium sugar caddy, and a 2-pint bottle of semi-skimmed milk, on a pleasingly biscuit-coloured wooden tray. All very stripped-down and simple. You get the impression this is a man who does not like mess, and treats strangers with the same high standards he expects in his own life. Two pints tells you he lives alone, and frugally. The tray says his kitchen is pristine, and his fingernails clean.  I\u0027m not sure what Mary\u0027s tea tray looked like - but there are rumours it involved proper cups with saucers. AND BISCUITS.  Boris did not do that. In fact, Boris could not have made more of a cock-up of it if he tried.  The tray contains a hotch-potch of thick clay mugs. One came free with an Easter egg. One looks like it usually has toothbrushes in it. Another bears a corporate logo, and one appears to be from a Battersea Power Station sponsorship programme.  They are, in short, the mugs you make the staff drink from. Mugs that don\u0027t matter.  And no sugar bowl for the snappers. No. A half-open packet of granulated, no doubt with a used spoon wedged in it.  This is a tray that screams YOU\u0027RE ALL PEASANTS, NOW SAY THANK YOU.   And bear in mind, this is the fellow\u0027s second home. He\u0027s a multi-millionaire. There\u0027s bound to be nice mugs and a milk jug in that farmhouse somewhere, he just hasn\u0027t bothered to produce them. The milk is truly boggling. The man has four children and a wife. The children are grown up, but even if they weren\u0027t at home there\u0027s a minimum of two adults there for the whole weekend, and possibly friends and political advisers visiting. A single pint of milk wouldn\u0027t last an afternoon, so anyone sane would buy a 4-pinter on the trip down from London. Which leads me to the uncomfortable conclusion that Boris is either so stupid he bought several, more expensive 1-pint bottles, or that he keeps an old 1-pinter to use as a milk jug. And that\u0027s just skanky.  He is the antithesis of Teddy Sheringham. This is a tea boy who leaves you wondering whether the mugs were washed first, and what in. His fingernails, were they to be inspected, would almost certainly contain traces of the past week\u0027s bogeys. Boris did admirably in refusing to answer questions, and declaring himself on a humanitarian mission because you have been here all day and you\u0027ve been incredibly patient. But if the purpose of his jaunt down the garden path was to buy goodwill, it failed for three simple reasons.  The first is that tea is fundamentally about good manners. The same rituals and purpose apply whether in a Japanese tea ceremony or a truckers\u0027 roadside caff. Boris\u0027 tray displays an impolite lack of consideration, and would be looked at aghast were he to offer such a thing at an official reception, to his in-laws, or to Theresa May.  But seeing as Boris is in his current disciplinary hate-crime pickle because he likened veiled Muslim women to letterboxes, manners are presumably something he lacks on a grand scale.  The second is that, if this tray is really the best he could muster, he must surely have seen that it needed adornment of some kind. Half a packet of Digestives, perhaps, or a handful of Penguins. Anything. Instead, it\u0027s as graceless as his writing. And third is the basic rule that anyone volunteering for a tea run is usually doing it to be nice - to repay an earlier run done by a colleague, to suck up to someone, or to apologise for past wrongs.  In Boris\u0027 case, he\u0027s doing it to pretend to be nice. A bit like when he and Gideon Osborne sat down with some Transport for London workers in hi-vis jackets, and tried for a photo that didn\u0027t make them look like Buller boys talking to daddy\u0027s horse valet.   In short, the best that Boris could do, when caught in a jam of his own making and confronted by journalists, was to attempt deflection with a half-hearted tea round that did little more than belittle the people he delivered it to. The proof is in the pudding with these things, and those journalists will no sooner give him an easier ride tomorrow than he will deliver them a tea pot and the family china.  Not just because since Boris\u0027 column last week there has been an increase in reported hate incidents against women wearing a face veil, but because journalists know and loathe Boris of old.  He\u0027s been fired for making up quotes from his own godfather, promised to use journalistic means to track down the address of someone a mate wanted beaten up, and has not only used his pen to foment racism but boasted of the \u0026pound250,000 he is reportedly paid for doing it.

Gareth Bennett recently said burqas are a part of “alien culture” and that areas such as Canton, in Cardiff, feel like “Saudi Arabia”.  Before walking out on a WalesOnline reporter, Mr Bennett claimed - without providing evidence - that immigrants were being given council houses ahead of locals, and insisted immigration was having a negative impact.  But he became agitated as he was questioned over the burqa and stormed out, telling a reporter: You come in here with preconceived opinions and ideas. Clearly frustrated by the questions, Mr Bennett, 49, suggested that immigration was dragging down public services such as housing, education and the NHS.  Mr Bennett, who was elected to the National Assembly in 2016 and is being investigated by the standards commissioner, said: “You need to look at the impact on housing, you need to look at the impact on education, you need to look at the impact on the National Health Service. “And you need to stop just looking at individuals and thinking \u0027because I like this bloke in the corner shop that means immigration is wonderful\u0027. That is merely infantile.” Mr Bennett, who was elected on Friday as Ukip\u0027s leader in Wales, was then questioned over his comments about the burqa amid the row over Boris Johnson\u0027s opinions about the traditional clothing worn by Muslim women. Reporter Ruth Mosalski brought up the story of a Welsh woman who chooses to wear a face veil and asked Mr Bennett why he believes it is not choice to wear the garment. He said: “I believe that if every person took a choice on what to wear, would there by any limits on what they did? What if you went outside the house naked … would that be ok?”  As they debated that point, Mr Bennett then patronised the reporter, saying: “Will you listen? Will you actually try and learn something?” Ms Mosalski responded: “Please don’t patronise me.” Mr Bennett began to take his microphone off and said: “You are a useless interviewer. You come in here with preconceived opinions and ideas. You have no ability to engage with the argument.” The reporter asks him to stay and answer more questions, but the politician responds: “No. Absolute rubbish, Ruth.” He then picks up his bag and walks out. What does the reporter have to say? Here is local government reporter Ruth Mosalski\u0027s take on the interview: In an interview at the WalesOnline office, we asked Mr Bennett to explain how he felt about his rise from council candidate to group leader and how he saw the future of the group. We had also drawn up a list of comments that Mr Bennett has previously made to ask him if he stood by them and why he believed them to be true.   What we wanted to question him on:  1. He was previously banned from speaking in the Assembly after saying there had to be a limit to transgender rights or there would be a total implosion of society. 2. Before his election in 2016 he said the ethnicities...possibly the Eastern Europeans were causing litter problems in a Cardiff suburb 3. That the burqa is part of an alien culture and parts of the Cardiff suburb Canton were like Saudi Arabia 4. That non Welsh speakers are being discriminated against 5. Plaid and Labour are pushing Wales towards a Stalinist Police State 6. The 2011 referendum giving the Assembly law-making powers was a con trick and most recently that the Assembly should be scrapped. But, during questions about why a woman we interviewed last week chose to wear the burqa was different to any other woman\u0027s choice, Mr Bennett stood and said he was leaving the interview.   Who is Gareth Bennett?  Mr Bennett was elected to the Assembly on the regional list in 2016. Before that, he had stood as a council candidate in the Riverside by-election. His website says he is a former Llandaff City junior school and Radyr Comprehensive pupi. He worked at a video rental store before attending Middlesex Polytechnic to study sociology but dropped out partway through the course. He took a one-year course in journalism before working at the Carmarthen Journal for fouryears. Over the next 15 years, he worked as an administrator, call centre operative, English teacher (in China and South-East Asia), property developer, painter and decorator, pub barman and general building labourer. He has written books about Cardiff and co-founded Cardiff City Football Club fanzine which ran for three years. He entered politics via the Trotskyist Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP) at the age of 16 and was later active in the Labour Party. He joined Ukip in 2014 and was elected to the Assembly in 2016. Mr Bennett has claimed he is currently being investigated by the standards commissioner over many issues. Sir Roderick Evans is understood to be probing the spending of more than \u0026pound9,000 of public money on a constituency office in Pontypridd that never opened.   Mr Bennett recently told the BBC: If he wants to waste his time investigating me he can carry on.  Asked how he was feeling after his election to head of an Assembly group, he said: Well I suppose I\u0027ve been a member of the Assembly for two years so there has been something of a transition. He admitted it had been a turbulent time for Ukip but said the change of national leader was nothing to do with the Assembly group. It\u0027s been a pretty turbulent period, I would agree with you. I think one of the problems was that we were slightly fortunate in the Assembly elections in the timing of it, it was slightly before the Brexit referendum so the single issue most people associated Ukip with was Brexit, which wasn\u0027t essentially anything to do with the Welsh Assembly but the issue of Brexit helped to get us elected. He said there was no planning in the national party about what happened after Brexit. No-one seemed to know. Asked if there were an Assembly election soon, would Ukip get in with the same numbers, Mr Bennett said: It\u0027s difficult to know. The polls seem to indicate we are rising again so we possibly would get people in but we haven\u0027t risen to the levels of the opinion polls that we were in 2014-16. Asked if it was going to be a hard party to lead, he said he didn\u0027t anticipate problems from from leader Neil Hamilton. The difficulties may not lie with Neil, the difficulties may lie elsewhere. I agree with you, it has given the appearance of an unruly group. Asked if the party was still relevant, he said: That\u0027s a very good question, that\u0027s why I stood in the leadership election with the policies that I stood for because I wanted to make us relevant.  He was banned from speaking in the Assembly for a year after complaints about the language he used about the transgender community. In our interview, when asked if he stood by those comments, Mr Bennett said he had given a kind of apology to y Llywydd Elin Jones to get back into the Assembly so he had to be careful in what he said. I can\u0027t go back on what I said in my apology, he said. He said when his comments became a major news item he got a lot of publicity for it but he said he didn\u0027t anticipate he would be banned from speaking in the chamber. Asked if he did it for publicity, he responded: I wasn\u0027t totally aware when I wrote that speech, and then made it that it was going to be a massive controversy, sometimes it\u0027s difficult to anticipate where the controversy is coming to come. Asked if he realised speaking about transgender issues would create headlines, Mr Bennett said: Sometimes I say things that I think are common sense and that lots of people say and believe and yet you go into the Welsh Assembly and suddenly all these people are up in arms and I think \u0027Oh, I forgot, they\u0027re not living in the real world, I\u0027ve got to say different things in here\u0027. Asked what he thought the real world\u0027s view of transgender people and whether that is what he projected that day, he replied: I was projecting the majority opinion of people in Britain.  He said his comments were particularly about the nuttiest elements of the transgender community in relation to the Gender Recognition Bill. He said he didn\u0027t believe many elements of the transgender community didn\u0027t agree with it. Asked whether he stood by his comments, he said: I broadly stand by the points that I made at the time.  Questions to Gareth Bennett (GB) about immigration from Ruth Mosalski (RM)  RM: Before you were elected in 2016 you said that people of “different cultural attitudes” were responsible for rubbish being left on the streets of Roath and most recently, you’ve said burqas are a part of “alien culture” and that areas like Canton feel like “Saudi Arabia”. GB: Indeed. RM: Do you believe immigration is impacting Cardiff negatively? GB: Of course it is. RM: Why? GB: Because of the reasons you just explained to me as well as other reasons, compression of wages, pressure on public services, such as health and education, pressure on the quality of education, there are manifold reasons why it\u0027s having a negative impact. RM: Cardiff is a city known for immigration, built on immigration. The docks, dockworkers, Tiger Bay, Shirley Bassey, Betty Campbell - one of the best teachers we\u0027ve ever had in Wales. They were all here because of immigration. Do you really say people like that are impacting our city badly?  GB: Shirley Bassey was born in the 1930s, she grew in the 1950s, Betty Campbell was a similar generation. Why are you extending my comments about immigration today, to things that happened in the past? RM: So it\u0027s immigration today you have a problem with? GB: That\u0027s what we\u0027re talking about. We\u0027re not talking about immigration in the 1940s. RM: So what about the shopkeeper at the end of my road, who\u0027s open every day when I go to work and when I go [home] from work, has kids at our schools, he\u0027s a part of my community, what\u0027s he doing wrong? GB: Did I say he is doing something wrong? RM: So who is doing something wrong? GB: I\u0027m talking about a net impact of immigration, you are talking about individual people. RM: Of course I am, they are part of our community. GB: You can\u0027t have a whole policy based on individual people doing good. You\u0027re talking about wanting to know from me what I think about the net impact of immigration, is it positive, is it negative? And then you say, \u0027Ooh, this shopkeeper is a nice guy\u0027, this person in the Army is a nice person, you\u0027re reducing things to absurd levels. If we\u0027re talking about policy formulation, you have to look at the whole picture and you have to look at the net impact. RM: But Cardiff is made up of communities... GB: Cardiff is made up of many communities, yes. Cardiff is also short of housing, is bringing in 330,000 people every year into the UK and Cardiff having some of those people coming in, is that going to have a positive impact on the housing shortage, is it? RM: I believe immigration has a great benefit on our city, yes. GB: On the housing shortage?  RM: It would depend on who those people are and what their stories are but you won\u0027t let me talk about individuals. GB: It is not about individuals because you cannot construct policy on this story, and that story. RM: So then how can you say this person is taking a house off this person if we\u0027re not talking about individuals? GB: If an immigrant gets ahead of a local person in the housing queue, then how is that not having a negative effect on the local person? RM: They will have been assessed by the same criteria, same council guidelines, the same rules. Why is it any different? GB: The rules are absurd. The rules should favour local people, with strong and well established links in that community. Otherwise they are totally absurd. RM: Immigration doesn\u0027t mean someone who has been here five minutes, 10 minutes or a week, does it? An immigrant could have been on the housing waiting list just as long as someone from Cardiff? GB: This is just mere semantics. Try and look at the broader picture. You\u0027re not really getting anywhere with this. You need to look at the broader picture. You need to look at the broader impact on housing, you need to look at the impact on education, you need to look at the impact on the NHS and you need to stop looking at individuals and because I like this bloke in the corner shop that means immigration is wonderful. That is merely infantile.  Topic changes to Mr Bennett\u0027s comments about the burqa  RM: On Friday I interviewed a young lady called Sahar. She\u0027s in her 30s, she\u0027s Welsh and has lived in Cardiff all her life. She told me she chooses to wear a face veil in the way I chose to wear high heels sometimes. Why do you believe it\u0027s not her choice to decide what she wears? GB: I believe that if every person took a choice on what to wear, would there be any limits on what they did. What if you went outside the house naked? Would that be ok?

It’s not because he doesn’t want to, but because a one-in-a-million disability has robbed him of the nerves in his face. Doctors told his parents he would never walk or talk, but the brave man has defied the odds and now wants others to see past his disability. The worst thing is when people judge me based on how I look and assume I need to be talked to like a child – I know people don’t mean anything bad by it – but it’s so frustrating to someone like me. It is better to talk to disabled people and find out what they can and cannot do and then go from there, said Macauley, from Lancaster. Macauley’s mother Beverley had a completely normal pregnancy and there was nothing to suspect her first born would be struck with a rare condition called Moebius Syndrome.  Beverley was an excited first-time mum waiting to meet her baby boy but it soon became clear that it wouldn’t be all that simple. He was delivered by emergency caesarean and immediately rushed into a special care unit when he stopped breathing. It wasn’t long before Beverley began to suspect there was something not quite right. The tiny tot was unable to feed, as the syndrome meant he couldn’t suck like most new-borns. Doctors inserted a feeding tube and he was discharged nine days later. Over the first few months of his life, Macauley had multiple brain scans, blood tests and genetic testing while doctors tried to find the cause of his problems. At three months old he was as floppy as a new-born and his parents were told the devastating news he would never walk or talk. But with a lot of love and stimulation, Macauley did reach his milestones. He sat unaided when he was 10 months old, said his first word, ‘da-da’, at 12 months, and took his first steps when he was two-and-a-half. Macauley was a fighter.  He was 18 months old when doctors finally diagnosed him with the syndrome, a rare neurological condition which affects the nerves controlling facial expression and eye movement. I was in total shock at Macauley’s diagnosis as there was a one in a million chance of having it, Beverley recalled. I felt sad that he would never smile, experience kissing a girl, eat food properly and worried he would struggle fitting in without any facial expression. Macauley underwent ‘smile surgery’ on one side of his face at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital when he was 19-years-old but chose to not continue with the right side because the operation was so painful. Macauley has frequently been the target of cruel jibes and taunts in the playground over his condition. Growing up he remembers constantly having to stick up for himself as cruel kids called him names and physically attacked him. I have always been one to stick up for myself, no matter who it is. If someone says something negative towards me, it gets to me but I try my best to prove people wrong, he explained.

Peter Williams, 46, is taking on the trek to honour his “dance- mad” daughter, Ellie, who lost her life to a brain tumour at the age of seven. With each turn of the pedals of the route from Bristol Children’s Hospital, where his daughter Ellie was treated, to Land’s End, Peter will be replaying his happy memories of her, and helping to save other families the heartache of losing a child to a brain tumour.  Pete aims to raise \u0026pound10,000 for The Brain Tumour Charity and the bike ride – starting on September 26 – will take him through Avon, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.   Ellie died from a rare, highly aggressive Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) in 2015, six months after she was diagnosed. “She loved cycling and learned to ride a bike without stabilisers when she was just three,” says Peter who lives in Penzance, Cornwall with partner Kaz, 44, and son Joe, 13. “I’ll never forget how happy and proud she looked of herself – nearly as proud as I was! And I’m so glad I captured that magical memory on video.” The family’s nightmare started in October 2014 during a half-term break in London. “We were having a brilliant time sight-seeing and the kids were excited about seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the theatre,” said Peter. Just before their trip, he and Kaz noticed that Ellie’s right eye had been looking “a bit strange.” “It sometimes looked boss-eyed and pointed inwards a little,” said Peter.  “At first, we put it down to her just being silly and playing around like kids do – she was often pulling funny faces. “We’d also noticed that she would occasionally stumble, again we put this down to Ellie being herself and messing about – it was very subtle.” But when her eye was still turning inwards during their break, they took her to be checked over at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. “After an examination the doctor said that her eyes were fine and she should have an urgent MRI scan,” said Peter. “We went straight to Hillingdon Hospital, Uxbridge.” After her scan, doctors broke the devastating news that no parent thinks they’ll ever hear– Ellie had a brain tumour. She was immediately sent to Bristol Children’s Hospital.   After a further scan, the devastated couple were told that Ellie had a rare DIPG tumour , which about 40 children a year are diagnosed with.  “The tumour was inoperable because it was in her brain stem,” said Peter. “Her inturned eye had been caused by her tumour, so she hadn’t been messing around pulling funny faces at all. “Our world was turned upside down.” Doctors told them that Ellie had six-12 months to live. She had radiotherapy for six weeks, but there was no further treatment available for her. In hindsight, Peter recalled other warning signs. “Leading up to her diagnosis, Ellie had also started to lose confidence in going to her dance lessons, which she had loved,” said Peter. “She’d usually be straight in but she started to ask me to wait for her outside the dance studio. “And she’d always looked forward to going to school but suddenly she wasn’t so keen on going.”  The couple were determined to pack Ellie’s final months with happy memories. “Our family, friends and community rallied around to make the last months with Ellie magical with trips and days out, “said Pete. “We had the most special family Christmas when more than 20 of us rented a house in Cornwall – we’ll always treasure those memories.” In Ellie\u0027s final weeks, the family started visiting Little Harbour children\u0027s hospice where she died on April 4, 2015. “The hospice staff were amazing and Ellie passed away peacefully in our arms,” said Peter. “Joe misses his sister terribly and has been an incredible little man, very brave. “It has been such a painful time but we have had wonderful support and help from our family, friends, community and Ellie’s school. “We could not have got through our loss without them. “Not a day goes by that we don’t miss Ellie – just messing around, watching her draw and hearing her play the piano. “She was very loving - and very competitive! As well as dance, she liked tennis, gymnastics and was a great swimmer.” The idea for Pete’s sponsored ride was sparked when he was pottering about in his shed one afternoon and saw Ellie’s pink bike – her pride and joy, which she got for her last Christmas present. As a vivid image of her thrilled little face flashed into his mind, he was inspired to do a sponsored ride on her bike. “It was a light bulb moment,” said Peter “Ellie was quite poorly when she got the bike for Christmas but she was blown away and couldn’t wait to take it out. “I’ve got vivid memories of her riding over the bridge near our home on it.” Peter decided to tap into his daughter’s joy and determination with a long-distance ride on her 20-inch high bike.  “I think Kaz and Joe thought I was a bit mad at first! But they’re backing me all the way and giving me lots of encouragement. “As well as the distance, it will be physically challenging as the bike is designed for a seven-year-old and I’m six foot. “I haven’t modified the bike at all but, after some practice rides, I am tempted to buy a bigger saddle as it really is tiny and very hard on my bum!” But Pete says it’ll be worth it.  “We think it’ll be a very touching way to remember Ellie and raise money in her memory, “ he said.  “People will probably wonder what on earth I’m doing on a child’s bike but I’m hope they’ll show their support tooting en route when they see the charity banner, and I’d love to get #LittlePinkBike trending.” Poignantly, Ellie should’ve left primary school this year along with her friends, and be getting ready for the adventure of secondary school. But her year at St Hilary School in Penzance remembered their friend by taking part in a mass bike ride last month. Dressed in pink, 50 pupils joined Pete for a three-mile route complete with police escort. “It was so touching to see that sea of pink raising money in Ellie’s memory,” said Peter who has a family-run flag printing company. “Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killer of children and under-40s in the UK, yet less than 2 % of the annual spend on cancer research goes on brain tumours. “More research is vital and if I can help save just one family from our heartache, then it’s worth it – and Ellie will inspire me every push of the pedals.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british woman 81 claims benidorm","story":"NewsBritish tourist moans her Benidorm holiday was ruined by \u0027too many Spanish people\u0027Freda Jackson, 81, said she cried at the end of her two-week trip to the popular holiday destination through travel operator Thomas Cook in May this yearShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTom Kershaw10:41, 13 AUG 2018Updated18:12, 14 AUG 2018NewsFreda Jackson, 81, said that Spanish people should go somewhere else for their holidays (Image: Lancashire  / SWNS)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British woman has claimed her holiday to Benidorm was ruined because her hotel had \u0027too many Spaniards in it\u0027 Freda Jackson, 81, said that Spanish people should go somewhere else for their holidays and she cried at the end of her two-week trip. The pensioner, who suffers from mobility issues, says her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. Retired care assistant Freda said: The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude. One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?  Freda had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says the travel operator Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Grandmother-of-six Freda and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Freda, who lives in Blackburn, Lancashire, said: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish.  My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after. We wanted to go somewhere on flat ground and not in the hills because we have mobility issues. To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claims Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday.  She said there were no reps on the holiday who they could complain to about the trip - so instead Ms Jackson submitted a letter of complaint to Thomas Cook. Thomas Cook bosses initially offered Freda and her friend a \u0026pound75 holiday voucher as compensation for the \u0027disappointing\u0027 trip abroad. But after declining the initial \u0027goodwill gesture\u0027 made by the travel company, they made an improved offer of \u0026pound566 to be split between Freda and her friend.

(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dirty doctor who secretly filmed female patients for sex kicks during appointments in a “massive violation” has been jailed.  Sneaky pervert Dr Thair Altaii covertly recorded women during consultations at his surgery in a gross breach of trust, Chronicle Live reports.  He was found to have taken and retained 19,000 images and videos of women during visits to see him at the practice where he was a partner. The 55-year-old had denied three voyeurism charges between 2008 and 2014 in relation to two female patients and more than 300 pictures but jurors convicted him after a trial last month.  Now Altaii, who is likely to be struck off by the General Medical Council later this year, has been jailed for 14 months at Newcastle Crown Court .   As he was sentenced, victim impact statements from the two victims were read to the court. One said: “In the one place you ought to feel safe, I have suffered a massive violation at the hands of the person I trusted with my personal problems. “I have never been a confident person and I do all I can to avoid being photographed or videoed by anybody, even my own family. “He violated his position of trust for his own gratification and for no other reason. “It makes me feel physically sick to think what the images were used for.” The other victim said she “shuddered to think” how long he had been taking images of her, saying that she became “extremely distressed” as she learned of the amount of material that the doctor had stored. In her statement, the victim said: “I trusted him with my privacy without question. “I can’t believe his disregard for my privacy. You should be able to trust your doctor with private matters as they are the people who make life-changing decisions on your behalf. “I cannot fully express how completely broken I feel because of the actions of Dr Altaii.”  Locking him up and ordering him to sign the sex offenders’ register for ten years, Judge Edward Bindloss said Altaii had “secretly and surreptitiously” recorded patients without their consent or knowledge. He added: “Victims were being recorded in the doctor’s surgery, a place where they should have been able to feel safe.” During his trial, jurors heard that when police examined his laptop, they found 19,000 images of women, “some clothed and others in various states of undress”, which were “apparently taken in the surgery environment”. Altaii, of White Rocks Grove, Whitburn, South Tyneside, claimed he took the footage for training and self-assessment purposes. He even claimed in relation to one of the pictures: “You see the thong, I see the scoliosis.” The recovered images of one of the complainants, which were shown to the jury, included her in a bra, putting on or taking off a dress, having her chest listened to, lifting her dress up, pulling her top up, putting on or taking off knickers or shorts, standing in her underwear and with her buttocks exposed. A video clip was played to the court, which shows Altaii appearing to ready the mobile phone to record before saying “Yes, come in” to the patient. The young woman, wearing a vest top, talks to him about her studies and he tells her tests with have come back fine. He then takes her blood pressure and appears to check her chest with a stethoscope. She complains about pains in her legs and another clip shows footage of her removing her tights and he examines her legs on a bed.  Alternative angles of the initial consultation and of the leg examination - allegedly taken from a second mobile phone - were also played. The woman said she was not asked for consent for the taking of the pictures, nor would she have given it. Prosecutor Louise Reevell told the court: “Matters came to the attention of the police in August 2014 when one of the defendant’s patients contacted the police with concerns following an appointment with the defendant during, which she noticed two mobile phones propped up in a consultation room. “One was propped up on the defendant’s desk, pointing towards the patient’s chair, a second was propped up on a shelf overlooking the examination table in the same room.” As a result of what the woman told police, Altaii was arrested and items were seized from his home, including a Dell computer. Miss Reevell said: “They found more than 19,000 images of women. “Some were clothed, others were in various states of undress and the images were apparently taken in the surgery environment. “They also found video clips of patients being examined.” Police identified one woman on the footage, of whom there were 223 images as well as a video clip of a consultation. Miss Reevell said: “(The complainant) was completely unaware she was being recorded and had not consented. “She saw the images and thought they were taken over a three to four year period from looking at her hairstyle and clothing. All without consent.” "},{"url":null,"title":"emergency jet2 plane landing saw","story":"NewsEmergency Jet2 plane landing saw oxygen masks drop during terrifying pressure loss plungeThe flight was making its way from Portugal to Leeds Bradford Airport when a loss of cabin pressure sparked an emergency landing in Bordeaux, southwestern FranceShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Corcoran20:08, 14 AUG 2018Updated01:18, 15 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn emergency plane landing saw oxygen masks drop in a terrifying pressure loss plunge which left passengers needing medical treatment.

The average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company banked almost \u0026pound5.7million in 2017, a report out today reveals.  The sum is equivalent to the annual salaries of more than 400 care workers, 286 binmen and 165 paramedics. It is also 38 times more than the Prime Minister gets – and comes after Theresa May’s botched bid to tackle such excess. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: “These figures show it is business as usual in Britain’s boardrooms. It is 10 years since the casino bankers crashed the economy but nothing has changed.

Malcolm and Karen Catterall managed to escape the vicious blaze at their house in Walkden, Salford, on Monday night.   Manchester Evening News reports that the home went up in flames when their son Correy, 23, returned from work at around 11pm.  Their pet Labrador, Pluto, did not survive after he ran back into the flames and Malcolm was left with the decision whether to attempt to rescue him or stay with his wife. The couple had left a pan of food on a low heat on the kitchen hob to keep it warm for Correy, and then gone up to bed. Yet the pan of mushy peas had burnt dry in just 15 minutes.  The family believe the back-draught caused by Correy opening the front door resulted in a fire ball ripping through the house. Malcolm, a former serviceman in the Royal Navy, grabbed his wife and their pet Labrador, Pluto, to make an escape through the back bedroom window. The 53-year-old said he had seconds to decide how they were all going to get away from the fire. He jumped out of the first floor window into the back garden and was then followed by Karen.  Though Malcolm caught his wife as she landed, Karen broke both her heels and is now in the Royal Bolton Hospital. She also suffered from smoke inhalation. But in the chaos of the blaze as Malcolm helped his injured partner, Pluto broke loose and ran back into the flames. “At the time I had to make the call between my dog or my wife,” said Malcolm.  “I did have hold of him but he started to panic and ran off. The problem is, he’s deaf. We were shouting him but he wouldn’t have been able to hear us. “I nearly went back in for him but by that time the house was full of thick, toxic smoke. “He was a lovely dog too and he sadly didn’t make it.” The majority of the semi-detached house was completely destroyed by the blaze. Malcolm and Correy are staying in a hotel while Karen recovers from her injuries in hospital. “It’s one of those things you think could never happen to you,” says Malcolm.

The Duchess of Sussex wants her dad Thomas Markle Snr to make contact in a respectful manner and stops airing the family\u0027s dirty laundry in interviews, a friend claims. Meghan and her father stopped speaking to each other shortly after she married Prince Harry in May, it is said. It came after Thomas Snr, 74, staged a series of paparazzi photos for cash days before the nuptials, and missed the ceremony at Windsor Castle due to his poor health.  Thomas Snr has claimed Harry, 33, called to ask about the photos and berated him as he lay in hospital recovering from a heart attack suffered just days before the May 19 wedding. The retired TV lighting director, who lives in Mexico, claims he slammed the phone down. He has done a number of interviews claiming Kensington Palace has cut him off from his 37-year-old daughter and he is unable to contact her.    But he can communicate with her via her 62-year-old mother and his ex-wife, Doria Ragland, according to a family friend. The friend told MailOnline: The only reason Meghan hasn\u0027t spoken to her father yet is because she\u0027s yet to hear from him in a respectful manner. Thomas is speaking to the press more than he\u0027s reached out and spoken to his own daughter. The friend, who wasn\u0027t named in the report, added: If Thomas truly wanted to speak with Meghan, he could easily have sent a letter to her mother and asked her to pass it along.  A spokesperson for Meghan and Harry declined to comment on the report. Meghan is estranged from a number of her family members, including her half-sister Samantha, who has criticised the royal in a series of interviews. Meghan Markle\u0027s dad: \u0027I don’t expect to see her or hear back from her again\u0027  Thomas Snr recently told how he is convinced that he will be “locked out” forever following a number of interviews he gave about her marriage.  But he was unrepentant about his decision to \u0026shypublicly speak out about the former Suits actress. He said: “All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. “I now want to go on vacation somewhere and try to get some peace.”  Thomas Snr, who has never met Prince Harry, claimed his repeated public pleas for the Duchess of Sussex to get in touch with him have fallen on deaf ears. He also claimed he did not receive a birthday card from Meghan when he turned 74 in July - despite sending two cards for her 37th birthday earlier this month. He also admitted he had hoped Meghan would care for him as he grows older, as he did for his mum.  Thomas\u0027 final plea came as Meghan\u0027s family branded her “cruel and inhumane” for allegedly snubbing her dad.  Her brother Tom Jnr, 51, told the Mirror previously he feared she has changed since becoming part of the royal family.  He said: “Throughout our lives, dad always put Meg first, above me and my sister, but if what he is saying is true it appears she is abusing his love for her. “It’s selfish, cruel even. He gave her everything and now she is giving him nothing but hurt back. Thomas Sr said he was devastated at not even receiving a formal invitation to his daughter’s wedding. He said: “Like any father, I wanted to say a few words. I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: ‘Daddy, I’ve met a man… Daddy, he’s English… Daddy, he’s a prince.’ “I thought it was a cute story. I was going to thank the royal family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. “But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.” His son Tom Jnr said: “They say blood is thicker than water, but perhaps the blue blood of the royals now runs through Meg’s veins.

Recently it was revealed that Prince William calls the Queen \u0027Gary\u0027 as he was unable to pronounce \u0027granny\u0027 as a child, while Prince Charles has dubbed Meghan Markle \u0027Tungsten \u0027, because, just like the metal, she\u0027s tough and unbending.   However we\u0027ve just discovered that Prince Harry has also given his sister-in-law a sweet nickname.  The Duke of Sussex, 33, reportedly never calls the Duchess of Cambridge, 36, \u0027Kate\u0027.  While she now has a string of titles to pick from, Kate only started using the nickname \u0027Kate\u0027 while at university, previously preferring to go by her full name of Catherine.  And it seems Harry is also a fan of her real name, as OK magazine have reported that he has taken to calling his brother\u0027s wife \u0027Cath\u0027.  Kate has previously admitted that she doesn\u0027t mind which name people choose to call her.  During an interview with BBC Radio 1 presenter Scott Mills she said: I will answer to most things.   As well as Catherine, Kate and Cath, the duchess is also called \u0027babe\u0027 and \u0027darling\u0027 by her husband, \u0027mummy\u0027 by her children and while at school she was known as \u0027Squeak\u0027. The latter was derived from the name of a guinea pig.

Katie Stubblefield, now 22, has spoken candidly about the operation, which means she can now breathe, chew and swallow unaided. Katie, now 22, suffered severe gunshot wounds to her face in March 2014, and doctors thought she would not survive. She now hopes her harrowing story will inspire others not to try to end their lives. Speaking to National Geographic , who have made a documentary on her ordeal, Katie said: I am able to touch my face now, and it feels amazing.  And she continued: Life is precious, and life is beautiful. She attempted to take her own life in her older brother\u0027s bathroom at his home in Mississippi, and was rushed to hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Her brother Robert told the magazine that when he ran to her aid, her face was gone. Katie had suffered a string of health problems, having her appendix and gall bladder removed in the months before it happened, and had been betrayed by her then boyfriend, the magazine reports. She had 22 operations before becoming the youngest person ever to undergo a facial transplant in the US at the age of 21 last year.

The hulking \u0027smelly\u0027 carcass appears to have a tail or long tentacle, and tube-like hair or fur. The ugly chalk-coloured beast - reported to be larger than three men - has “no definite head or eyes”, it was reported. Locals have speculated that it\u0027s a bizarre primeval relic from the deep or an extinct woolly mammoth released from an undersea permafrost grave by the warm summer.  But a marine scientist says it could be part of a whale.    The \u0027monster\u0027 was too heavy for locals to move after it was found on the Pacific coastline of the Kamchatka peninsula, near the remote village of Pakhachi, according to The Siberian Times.  Locals have failed to identify the \u0027strange creature\u0027 and they\u0027re appealing to scientists to name the \u0027baffling behemoth\u0027 found on a beach. Witness Svetlana Dyadenko wrote online: “The most interesting thing to me is that the creature is covered with tubular fur.  “Could it be some ancient creature? I wish scientists could inspect this enigma that ocean threw at us.” After inspecting the “stinking” monster, she likened it to a vast “hairy octopus”. She said: “It does look like fur, but it’s tubular, as if a lot of tiny pipes hang down the carcass. “A really strange-looking creature.  “We googled it and couldn’t find anything resembling it.” Svetlana reported that locals “could not dig or pull it out. She added: “You would need an excavator because part of it got completely covered with sand.”  One puzzled onlooker said: “I wonder if it came from a thawed glacier?” Another woman replied: “It’s got to have been brought from the Arctic.” One theory is that the beast could be a “globster”, a term coined in 1962 to describe a mysterious carcass washed up in Tasmania.

The West Germans were desperate to lay the ghost of Berlin 1936, the tournament hijacked by Adolf Hitler. So this would be Die Heiteren Spiele – “the cheerful Games” – with a sunny logo and Waldi the dachshund mascot. And, thanks to new satellite technology, sporting fans across the globe could enjoy the sports fest live. But on September 5, 900 million watched these Games hijacked by evil too, and history written in blood, not the sweat and tears of sporting glory. Eight heavily armed terrorists from Palestinian group Black September broke into apartments in the Olympic village taking 11 Israelis hostage. The subsequent siege and bungled rescue bid left all the Israelis dead, along with five Palestinians and a German police officer.  The Munich Massacre, and Israel’s subsequent “Wrath of God” campaign of revenge assassinations, launched a whole new era of international terrorism that sparked 9/11, fanned the flames of the conflict in the Middle East and swept across Europe.  And now it’s threatening to engulf Jeremy Corbyn as his party’s anti-Semitism row burns on.   Because in 2014 he attended a ceremony in Tunisia where it is claimed a wreath was placed on the graves of Palestinians behind the Olympic atrocity .  The Labour leader has said that he does not think he was “actually involved”. He simply wanted “a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident”. And he claims the 2014 wreath-laying ceremony commemorated victims of an Israeli air strike on the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s headquarters in Tunis in 1985. But Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – a former commando once shot in the shoulder by a Black September terrorist – is stoking the row.  So how did the Munich Massacre shape modern terrorism and why are film makers like Steven Spielberg – who made the 2006 drama Munich – drawn to retell the bloody story? Black September was named after a bloody attack on the PLO by the Jordanians in September 1970. The following year the PLO began a two-year campaign of murder, assassination, hostage takings and letter bomb attacks. But Munich made its name. Just after 4am terrorists armed with grenades and assault rifles burst into an apartment and seized five officials and trainers: Yossef Gutfreund, Amitzur Shapira, Kehat Shorr, Andre Spitzer, Jacov Springer and Moshe Weinberg. In another apartment they captured wrestlers and weightlifters Eliezer Halfin, Yossef Romano, Mark Slavin, David Berger and Zeev Friedman. When the Israelis fought back, the terrorists opened fire, killing Romano and Weinberg. The other nine were beaten, taken hostage and forced to watch as Romano’s body was castrated.  The gang, led by Luttif Afif – codenamed Issa – and Yusuf Nazzal – Tony – then demanded the release of 234 prisoners held in Israeli jails, throwing Weinberg’s body out of the door to show they meant business. They also demanded a plane to fly them and the hostages to the Middle East. As the horror unfolded the Games were suspended and broadcasters beamed live footage of the siege to more than 100 countries. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir refused to give in to “blackmail of the worst kind” so the Germans began secretly planning an ambush at an airfield, to which the gang and their hostages had been flown by helicopter. But staggering incompetence and cowardice led to a bloodbath. Five untrained “snipers” were left to tackle eight well-armed terrorists – in the dark. And 16 German police dressed as crew realised they were on a suicide mission and abandoned their posts. Then, after an hour-long shootout, the Germans sent armoured cars on to the tarmac and a gunner in one accidentally injured two colleagues.  The panicked terrorists opened fire on their tied-up captives and threw grenades into the helicopters, burning them beyond recognition. But the bodies of the five dead Palestinians, including Issa and Tony, were flown back to the Middle East and given heroes’ funerals. Simon Reeve, author of One Day in September explains: “The unprecedented attack, siege and massacre had a huge impact. In many ways it was the 9/11 of the 1970s. “Suddenly the world realised terror was not confined to the Middle East. “For Israel, the sight of Jews dying again on German soil, just a few decades after the Holocaust, was simply too much. Israel struck back hard. Warplanes bombed Palestinian ‘military bases’, killing many militants, but also scores of innocent civilians and children. “Hundreds of Palestinians joined militant groups in response.” The three terrorists who survived were jailed awaiting trial but were freed in October in a hostage exchange when a Lufthansa plane was hijacked.  Many believe the Germans colluded with Black September over the terrorists’ release to stop any further attacks on their nation. This suspected collusion infuriated Golda Meir who ordered the formidable Israeli secret service, Mossad, to launch Operation Wrath of God. The aim – to track down and kill all those responsible for Munich. Reeve says: “Over the next 20 years Israeli agents killed dozens of Palestinians. They hid landmines under car seats, devised ingenious bombs and claim to have killed two of the three terrorist survivors of Munich.” But what became of the third? Jamal al-Gashey went into hiding, in North Africa or Syria, knowing he would always be an Israeli target. However, in 1999, he emerged briefly to appear in a documentary that won an Oscar. He was heavily disguised, shown only in shadow and claimed: “Before Munich, the world had no idea about our struggle, but on that day, the name of Palestine was repeated all around the world.” However, many other Palestinian with no links to Black September were also eliminated by the Wrath of God.

Fossil enthusiast Phillip Mullaly made the find of a lifetime on Victoria\u0027s Surf Coast when he uncovered a set of 7cm-long fossilised teeth from an extinct shark known as the Great Jagged Narrow-Toothed Shark (Carcharocles angustidens) in a boulder at Jan Juc. The apex predator is believed to be an ancestor to the megalodon, the largest shark that ever lived and the subject of upcoming Hollywood blockbuster \u0027The Meg\u0027. They also found teeth from several sixgill sharks, which the scientists said feasted upon the giant shark after it died.  The fossil, consisting of 40 teeth, is the first of its kind found in Australia, Deutsche Presse-Agentur reports.   The mega-toothed shark, which lived about 25 million years ago, was the top predator, preying on small whales. They could grow to be more than nine meters long, almost twice the size of the great white. The museum said finding multiple teeth from the same shark is extremely rare. Tim Ziegler, a palaeontologist at Museums Victoria, said the sixgill shark\u0027s teeth would have become dislodged from their jaws as they fed on the huge carcass of the mega-shark. Sixgill sharks still live off the Victorian coast today, where they live off the remains of whales and other animals, he said. This find suggests they have performed that lifestyle here for tens of millions of years.  Paleontologist Dr Erich Fitzgerald said the species recently discovered was closely related to the megalodon - and aptly sat at the top of the food chain. Dr Erich said: This species was believed to be an ancestor of the megalodon, they\u0027re genetically very close. There\u0027s similarities in the anatomy and shape of the teeth. But megalodon didn\u0027t turn up until ten million years after this species. The great jagged sat at the top of the food-chain and fed on anything and everything, especially whales. He said most shark fossil discoveries were just single teeth, making it ultra-rare to find multiple teeth from the same shark. After being notified Dr Erich led a team of palaeontologists, volunteers, and Phillip on two expeditions earlier this year to excavate the site, collecting more than 40 teeth.

Moussa got absolutely battered at times but his hold up play was great. Mendy worked his socks off up there.“But you have to work the keeper and they know that. It’s not that I’m having a go at them, they understand that.“I do think we need help in that department. There’s no guarantees I bring a striker in and he’s going to do better but we need to bring players in for those areas.“That being said we do work. The guys just need to slow down, the most important thing they need to do is make the keeper make a save.”As for the goal that won the game, Neil conceded after initial doubts he agreed Bobby Madden’s call to award a penalty against Genseric Kusunga for handling a Niall McGinn corner was correct.“Just to address the penalty, I’ve seen it, it’s a penalty,” he added.“At the time I wasn’t sure. I went to Bobby to get his opinion on it at the end of the game and regardless of how close Gensi is, he felt it was a penalty.

It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me.

Olivia was really chuffed about it.“It did feel a little weird coming home, just because we know that everything is going to be different.”Olivia was reunited with her two sisters, Taylor and Billie, after five weeks apart.Senga said: “My other two girls were at home for five weeks, and we’re just trying to get back into the routine of spending time together as a family.“She’s really loved it, I can’t get peace and quiet now. But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had

she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting

Nunalleq site.Dating back more than four centuries, their finds include wooden ritual masks, ivory tattoo needles, and even a belt of caribou teeth, all preserved in “extraordinary condition”.Now archaeologists and museum staff from the university are working with The Qanirtuuq Native Village Corporation to put the finishing touches to the first exhibition at a new museum which will enable them to be displayed in their place of origin.Aberdeen University project leader Dr Rick Knecht said: “The unique conditions in this arctic region mean artefacts which are more than four centuries old have retained an unbelievable level of detail.“We have uncovered grass baskets and mats made when Shakespeare walked the earth but when we take them out of the ground the grass weaving still retains a trace of its green colour and we have been amazed by the variety and intricacy of the woven patterns.”Once removed from the ground, however, the artefacts begin to deteriorate quickly and it is for this reason that Dr Knecht and his team transported more than 50,000 items to Aberdeen University, where professional conservators oversaw preservation treatment.Dr Knecht said: “When we began the project, it was impossible to conduct conservation work on site, and the items recovered were transported, some still covered in earth, to Aberdeen.“The long-term goal, however, has always been to return them to where they belong and that has become possible with the imminent opening of the new Nunalleq Culture and Archaeology Research Center.”He added: “This is one of the largest collections ever recovered from a single site in Alaska, and perhaps even the whole Arctic region, and is of huge significance as it now accounts for more than 90% of everything we know about pre-contact Yup’ik, one of the major indigenous groups in North America.“We are delighted to be working with the Nunalleq community to ensure these vital artefacts related to their lives can be shared in the place they belong.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cheque it out plans to turn north east bank into gym","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans have been submitted to turn a former north-east bank into a gym.The Clydesdale Bank

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"45 years of passion for argyll arts and crafts","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/08/18, 7:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt has been a focal point for Argyll artists and craftspeople for more than four decades, and now there is a changing of the guard at the Tarbert institution.Anyone visiting the village will no doubt have noticed the small, unassuming building right on the Tarbert harbour front, occupied by Earra Gael.Its name is closer to the true Gaelic spelling of \u0026#8216the coast of the Gael\u0026#8217 than the modern anglicised \u0026#8216Argyll\u0026#8217 and very much reflects the organisation\u0026#8217s purpose \u0026#8211 to promote a closer association between craftspeople and artists in southern Argyll, and to provide a retail outlet for them.Since the very beginning, one of the driving forces behind Earra Gael has been Sarah Coats.It was at the end of last year that her family suggested that she might think about slowing down \u0026#8211 just a little.She took a little persuasion but, at the age of 81, she reluctantly agreed, but Mrs Coats has a fascinating tale to tell.The Earra Gael Association began at a meeting of arts and crafts enthusiasts in the Tarbert Hotel in January 1973.In her records from the time, Mrs Coats records: \u0026#8216It was the drive and enthusiasm of Tony Newberry of Skipness Woodcraft that actually got it going.\u0026#8216It was decided to advertise an open meeting on February 17, and it was there that the association was formally launched under the chairmanship of Tony Newberry.\u0026#8216A list of names was suggested and the majority voted for Earra Gael.\u0026#8217Around 30 members were involved from the beginning, and retail premises were found at the Tarbert weighbridge building, leased from Tarbert Harbour Authority.Mrs Coats records: \u0026#8216The shop opened in 1973 with overall sales of £4,457. Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"avenue arch improvement scheme to be re tendered","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA project to improve the condition of Inveraray\u0026#8217s iconic 18th century arches looks to be making progress as bids to carry out the work are invited.But the Dalmally road archway, refurbished around five years ago but never re-painted, will not be part of the contract.This will be the second time the work has been put out to tender by Argyll and Bute Council.Speaking at last month\u0026#8217s annual general meeting of community development company Inspire Inveraray, council regeneration manager Audrey Martin said: \u0026#8216It has already been out to tender, but the bids were too dear.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village.

The big bird was scoffing the chips close to the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr. A grainy image of the pointless attack has only now emerged. The man is wearing what looks like a white short sleeved shirt, black trousers and white training shoes. He is seen lifting his right leg back and then battering the chip-loving gull. Any kick to a creature like this would have left it in a very painful condition or at worst cause it to die from internal injuries. The chips had already been dropped on the ground close to the junction of Carrick Street and Boswell Park and it is not been regarded as a case where the gull actually stole the grub. Ironically the bird’s attacker was also eating his own portion of takeway food. The grainy image looks to have been taken from mobile phone footage. It appears to be right outside a late night food takeaway. The bird-brained incident took place on Saturday July 28 and only yesterday (Tuesday) was it able to be made public. An undercover inspector from the charity’s special investigations unit has been working on the case. He said: “We are being assisted by Police Scotland in our investigation and we would like to trace the individual involved. “I would urge anyone who recognises him to get in touch. “ Any information given to our animal helpline is treated confidentially and can be given nonymously. “Recently we have been made aware of a number of incidents involving attacks on seagulls and would like to remind the public that gulls, like all other birds, are protected by law. “We’d encourage the public to clear up any rubbish as gulls are attracted to it as they look for food.” Anyone who thinks they know the lout or remember him from that Saturday should call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999. Ayr is in the middle of a seagull crisis at the moment with some of them attacking people including a prominent lawyer who had to fight off the attack using a rolled up copy of the Ayrshire Post. He was pecked on the top of his head in Burns Statue Square and the attack drew blood.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPolice Scotland"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13075347.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_020818flushes_05JPG.jpg","title":"mixed support hgv parking plan","story":"NewsMixed support for HGV parking plan in GirvanA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:20, 13 AUG 2018NewsTown centre car park could be used by HGVs for overnight stops (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think. At least that’s the view of four random people the Post spoke to in the town. But they want rules to ensure there aren’t trucks sitting in The Flushes car park 24/7. Ayrshire Roads Alliance are looking at a plan that would allow HGVs to park overnight. And Councillor Alec Clark supports the idea of trucks coming in from 6pm and leaving before 6am next day. But other voices in the town believe this could cause night-time noise for residents at the Hillcrest car home. And they fear excessive diesel fumes in the heart of the town.  Craig Galloway, 54, said: “Having the lorries going to The Flushes would free up the harbour area for cars and buses. And it would maybe stop them parking in the streets.” Mr Galloway added: “I think the lorries do bring a business benefit to the town, in terms of spending in shops and take-aways.” Nat Taylor, 64, thought: “The Flushes car park tends to empty at night, and the lorries are generally away first thing in the morning.” Mr Taylor added: “There’s really nowhere else that’s suitable. Ainslie car park (at the south end of the town) would only take about four HGVs.” Betty McQuiston, 76, has been involved with Girvan’s volunteer attractions committee for many years. She doesn’t want to see the town’s streets clogged up with heavy trucks. But she admitted: “ It’s a Catch 22 situation. We don’t necessarily want trucks overnight in the town - but they have to go somewhere.  “There’s already quite a lot parking in the streets, so having them at The Flushes would be better.” Mrs McQuiston added: “There’s no room at Ainslie car park, and the trucks have ripped up the surface at the harbour car park.” Scott Purdie, 49, believes a truck park could be created at Grangestone Industrial Estate. He said “It’s a big estate, with big areas of ground that could be used for overnight parking of trucks.” Mr Purdie added: “Big lorries don’t help tourism, but I can see the argument that they need somewhere to go. “However, 6pm is not late in the summer, and people in cars are sometimes frightened to park next to them. “I would fear The Flushes turning into a full-time lorry park, unless it’s properly regulated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"resident told how looked horror","story":"NewsResident told how she looked on in horror as drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at back court in Ayrshire streetMan taken away in hospital after alarm raised by concerned residentShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning11:00, 12 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA concerned resident told how she looked on in horror as a drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at a back court in Cumnock. The addict was spotted shooting up behind flats in the town’s Townhead Street. He was taken by ambulance to hospital after a worried neighbour contacted the police. The shocking incident was raised at Cumnock Community Council. Now there are fears that children playing in the back court could get injured if they picked up a discarded needle. One woman said: “There was a boy injecting himself for 20 minutes near trees at a back court. “There were needles lying about.” A police officer attended the community council meeting to give residents a report of crimes that had taken place in the past month. She vowed to take the matter up with the police inspector and urged residents with any concerns about drug abuse to contact police on 101. She added new community policing teams would be introduced across East Ayrshire in September and that more community officers would be seen out on the beat. She told the meeting that police had received 49 crime reports in Cumnock for the past month and 28 of them were detected. The majority of these crimes were theft by shoplifting and occurred at the town’s ASDA, according to the officer. She pointed out there had been a spate of opportunist house break-ins in the town but not in one particular street. One robbery and serious assault had taken place in Wylie Crescent and that had been detected, the officer added. Other crimes included breach of the peace and common assaults. Bob McCulloch, the council’s acting head of housing and communities, said: “Finding a discarded needle or syringe is undoubtedly worrying for members of the public. It is essential that such items are disposed of properly and safely to protect individuals and the wider community. “If needles or syringes are found in public areas, including roads, pavements, parks or public buildings, then individuals should phone 01563 554061 during working hours or 0345 724 0000 out with working hours. Please provide as much information as you can about the exact location of the items found to aid the disposal process. “In relation to private ground, the responsibility for disposal lies with the land owner.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre. Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

And this little beauty is the same age as Girvan owner Robert ‘Rab’ Smith. Retired bricklayer Rab is 62 and his Austin dates from 1956. “It’s quite a cute wee thing for its age,” said Rab of the British classic. The cars cost a mere \u0026pound507 when first launched in 1952. That was \u0026pound62 cheaper than main rival, the Morris Minor. Rab, who was also a retained firefighter for 26 years, loves a vintage car.  And he had a 1959 Austin A35, before acquiring the A30. The first owner of the new A30 in 1956 was James McCleary of Minnigaff, near Newton Stewart. Mr McCleary ran the car for years before it came into Ayrshire ownership in 1973 with first Frank Webster, then farmer Stanley Gray of Craigmalloch, Barr. Mr Gray also ran it for years, but by 1988 it was in total disrepair - and being used as a chicken coop. It was at this point that Hugh Sloan of Colmonell village came along to rescue the car. Mr Sloan took it to his workshop in Colmonell’s Main Street. And, in a labour of love, he performed a full restoration, including engine replacement and gearbox overhaul,  Hugh replaced the entire interior in 1981, re-chromed various features, and had the car re-sprayed ‘Rover Grey’. Rab said: “Hugh was totally dedicated to his car, and took it round local fetes and galas. “Sadly, he passed away in May this year when I acquired the car. “I hope to keep it in the best of condition for future generations to enjoy.” It is recorded that 223,264 Austin A30s were produced, but the survivors can now be measured in hundreds.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey maps of each section, a comprehensive accommodation guide and locations where cycle spares might be found.\u0026#8216We have cycled the route at least once in both directions although much of the research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat. For instance in Campbeltown Amelias, Food for Thought and Ceann Loch Diner are excluded.Neither of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s fish and chip shops are included, either in the listings or on the map, despite there being a map symbol for those takeaways.Many cyclists are inquisitive and will no doubt discover other options as the guide is just a starting point.The Caledonia Way may also appeal to motorised travellers as well as the self propelled.A separate concertina trip planner leaflet, inserted at the back of the book, shows a height cross section of the full route and is cross referenced to the accommodation providers.On the reverse of this route planner is a diagrammatic map, trip planning tool and mileage chart including a speech bubble stating: \u0026#8216Are there any more hills today.\u0026#8217The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Pete Martin and Janet Moss with their guidebook at the Campbeltown launch. 25_c31caledonia01_PeteMartin_Janet_Moss\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter safety first and cycling","story":"We totally agree with Jan McCorkindale’s  remarks regarding the  road signage and safety of cyclists on the A83 and all associated roads.Being regular users of these roads it is apparent that many cyclists refrain from wearing high visibility clothing and, also more significantly, do not use helmets for adults or children.As a sport cycling is becoming more popular.Perhaps cycling clubs and parents should be more vigilant to ensure use of these items before allowing anyone to use busy roads.Ann and Tom Campbell,Macharioch Shore and Motherwell.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish dunes club championship","story":"Gary Sheppard followed an opening round of 70 with a 72 on Sunday to defend the title he won in 2017, winning by four shots from David Lamont and five from Steven Gilmour.Steven had the best handicap total over the two days, with Neil Irving finishing runner-up in that section.A Mach Dunes spokesperson said: \u0026#8216Congratulations to all the winners, and many thanks to all the competitors for turning out to support this event.\u0026#8217Winner Gary Sheppard and runner-up David Lamont.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

The fact opposition is now coming from charities such as Children in Scotland and Play Scotland, who are funded partly by the Scottish Government, is significant. Teaching unions and parent bodies are also on the warpath.  However, backing down over the assessments - either by scrapping them altogether or allowing an opt-out for vulnerable pupils - is equally unpalatable because it will invite accusations of a ministerial climbdown.  Coming so quickly after Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos decision to shelve his Education Bill, opposition politicians would not be slow to accuse the government of looking increasingly weak on its core mission to close the attainment gap.  It is not all bad news. The tests in P1 have become a lightning rod for opposition to the standardised assessments as a whole because of the distress caused to some pupils.  The assessments have also been introduced in P4, P7 and S3, but these have attracted far less attention.  It is also clear the way the tests are being administered seems to be at the heart of the problem in P1.  Government guidance instructs schools to ensure that no distress is caused to pupils and councils have also been told not to put entire groups through the assessments at the same time.  The evidence from teachers is clear that has not always been the case, with suggestions groups of pupils are being tested on the same day, adding to pupil anxiety.  Mr Swinney will shortly bring forward revised guidance to try and bring to an end that practice.  The government is also keen parents speak to their child\u0026rsquos school if they have any queries about the assessments.  It may be such moves improve matters in the short term. It is also possible the current opt-out campaign does not attract the sort of widespread opposition that would kill off the assessments in P1.  However, neither of these things will address a fundamental concern of those now massing in opposition - that pupils learn best though play until they are at least seven and assessments at a younger age are meaningless."},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog-to-payout-12000-after-sacking-brewery-worker-who-faced-turning-blind","story":"  The billion-pound firm has been accused of \u0026ldquoastonishing ignorance in the way they handled the case, making \u0026ldquoblanket assumptions on employee James Ross\u0026rsquo condition and paying \u0026ldquolip-service to equality laws.  Mr Ross, who suffers from eye condition Stargardt disease, was working in the company\u0026rsquos Aberdeenshire brewery when he told bosses his eyesight had deteriorated and he was awaiting tests.  Despite reports from the RNIB and a specialist in visual impairment saying the 47-year-old could continue to work if some adjustments were made, Brewdog took the decision to dismiss him.  Mr Ross, from Fraserburgh, has now won his case for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination at an employment tribunal.  Speaking to the Herald, he said: \u0026ldquoThe way they dealt with my condition was really poor for a company of their size. The management just didn\u0026rsquot seem to have a clue how to deal with it, they just wanted to end it.  \u0026ldquoThey weren\u0026rsquot interested in making any changes, they just wanted me out.  \u0026ldquoBrewdog try to claim they\u0026rsquore this top company to work for, but I took this tribunal to show what they really are.  The tribunal heard that Mr Ross told the firm about his sight problems when he first started working for them in July 2016.  However, in January 2017 he told his manager that his vision was deteriorating.  He later provided Brewdog with a copy of a medical report stating that further tests were needed which would likely result in him being declared blind.  The company\u0026rsquos Health and Safety manager, John Fairclough, was asked to complete a risk assessment on Mr Ross and he was given a high risk rating.  An occupational health report was also ordered, which found that Mr Ross was not fit for work, but the tribunal found that this was not carried out by a medic with any expertise in visual impairment.  RNIB employment adviser Ruth Morrell then visited the brewery and recommended a number of changes that could allow him to keep working.  Mobility Officer Jeff Bligdon also visited the site and found that Mr Ross was still able to carry out his work without any difficulty.  In his report, Mr Bligdon stated: \u0026ldquoI felt that if [Brewdog] could end James\u0026rsquo employment with them, they would have done it there and then.  \u0026ldquoThe health and safety person was particularly negative towards James and came across as not wanting to adapt or try anything that would assist James.  Mr Ross was later sacked at a meeting in May after he rejected a computing role because it was harder for him to do with his eyesight problems.  The tribunal heard that managers involved in his case had no knowledge of the need to make adjustments for disabled people under the Equality Act.  Employment Judge Nick Hosie described this as \u0026ldquoastonishing.  The judge said that only \u0026ldquolip-service was paid to the law, while bosses also made \u0026ldquoblanket assumptions.  Judge Hosie added that Brewdog \u0026ldquoshould feel more than discomfort at the lack of awareness evidenced of their legal obligations to consider reasonable adjustments for an employee they recognised as disabled.  He urged the firm to ensure staff are now made aware of their legal requirements.

Marine Biopolymers Ltd (MBL) would extract natural polymers from the seaweed for uses in foods and pharmaceuticals.  It has published a scoping report as part of its work towards applying for one or more five-year licences.  Under the plan, the amount harvested would rise over the years from about 1,300 to 30,000 tonnes wet weight.  The kelp would be processed at a plant in Mallaig in the west Highlands.  In the report, the company said it would avoid sensitive marine environments, and areas of seabed would not be re-harvested within a given time period to allow the seaweed to recover.  \u0026ldquoAlthough, at-sea harvesting of Laminaria hyperborea would be a new industry in Scotland, such harvesting has been carried out sustainably for many decades in Norway, France and Iceland, the company said.  \u0026ldquoThe kelp would be harvested by specially designed harvesting vessels, using proven technology from Norway, and subsequently transported by boat to MBL\u0026rsquos proposed processing plant at Mallaig. A separate planning application is being submitted to Highland Council for the construction and operation of this plant.  In 2014 MBL scrapped a plan to open a \u0026pound20m seaweed processing plant on South Uist. The project could have created up to 60 jobs. The company switched its focus to the mainland.  Earlier this year it was announced that seaweed has found another use \u0026ndash in paint.  Isle of Skye businessman Alasdair Campbell set about researching sustainable materials to use in paint.  The experienced painter and decorator is now marketing a designer range of 32 colours, infused with the marine algae and inspired by the island\u0026rsquos dramatic landscape.  The venture began when Mr Campbell, who has run his own business on Skye for more than 20 years, started looking for local ingredients that could be added to masonry paint to toughen it up to withstand the harsh local climate.  He had hoped to use crushed Skye marble, but found that the lime content of the stone, which has been quarried on the island for centuries, was too high.  \u0026ldquoFrom the main natural ingredients that are readily available here, that left midges, rain and seaweed, said Mr Campbell, who, with his wife, Carol, runs the Isle of Skye Paint Company from their shop in Portree.  Continuing research showed seaweed, which is commonly used in marine paints, but not in household or masonry ranges, works well as a natural thickening agent, so Mr Campbell decided to use it in his new products.  The range currently uses seaweed from elsewhere in the UK, but Mr Campbell and another firm are trying to find a way of incorporating locally sourced algae.  And it is not the only unusual use for seaweed.  A seaweed processing factory in the Outer Hebrides supplies the product to feed top racing camels in Dubai.  Uist Asco ships tons of dried seaweed 3,800 miles to fuel the prize camels \u0026ndash which can be worth as much as thoroughbred racehorses. There are around 378,000 camels in the United Arab Emirates.  Many isolated Scottish islands still have the remains of kelpers\u0026rsquo huts from the times when seaweed was burned to extract potash and soda.  Soda and potash were important chemicals in the soap and glass industry and were widely used for linen bleaching. The extraction process involved burning the kelp in large, often stone-lined trenches.  Meanwhile, from making sure a pint of beer keeps its head to growing healthy plants, seaweed has many uses in today\u0026rsquos world.  In the food industry alginates serve to stabilise meringues and ice cream, improve the head on beer and allow fast-setting in puddings.  They also perform similar roles in the cosmetic, medical, paint and other industries.  A single \u0026lsquoseaweed\u0026rsquo De Havilland Mosquito was flown. Unfortunately, the material proved unsuitable and the company turned its hand to more conventional uses.  Although landlords could make a lot of money \u0026ndash at one time the industry was worth the equivalent of seven and a half million pounds a year to the Hebrides alone \u0026ndash very little of this ever found its way to the workers.  The economy of these peripheral communities was hit hard by the loss of the industry, and a considerable depression ensued. Attempts were made to revive the industry during the First World War but largely failed.  Now growing seaweed companies exist in Lewis and Uist and other areas of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"fashion-label-founded-by-scot-puts-ufc-star-conor-mcgregor-on-deck-with-clothes-ban","story":"  McGregor, who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), has to stop selling some of his signature clothing in Europe because it has broken EU-wide trademark laws.  The Irishman\u0026rsquos lucrative hoodies, shorts and sweaters, which bear his signature in huge letters, must be withdrawn from sale or he will have to pay compensation to the McGregor fashion label.  It was founded by Scottish businessman David Doniger almost 100 years ago and is now owned by a Dutch company.  A hat maker by trade, Doniger was a member of Clan Gregor and started producing clothing using its official tartan.  He established the company when he emigrated to New York in 1921.  The District Court in The Hague ordered Adidas and its subsidiary Reebok, which sells the 30-year-old\u0026rsquos exclusive sports clothing line, to withdraw garments sold in Europe.  Following a high profile deal with the UFC, Reebok launched Conor McGregor\u0026rsquos popular clothing emblazoned with his name.  But the McGregor fashion label sought a court injunction against Adidas to force them to withdraw their garments.  Their legal team claimed the public could be confused into believing some of the products made by Reebok for the Dublin-born star was part of their McGregor label.  Lawyer Remco van Leeuwen said: \u0026ldquoThe public would be confused into believing that the clothing made by Reebok for the Irish mixed martial artist and boxer comes from the McGregor fashion house.  \u0026ldquoWe asked Reebok to stop selling the clothing that would confused the public but they refused.  Judges heard the clothing sold by Reebok \u0026ldquowas bound to be confusing to the public because it has McGregor in huge letters while \u0026lsquoConor\u0026rsquo is so minuscule you hardly see it.  In a written judgement, the court found in favour of the Scottish-inspired McGregor, ruling the signature name in big letters of the fighter on the hoodie, shorts and jersey were a contravention of trademark regulations because it was similar to that of the plaintiffs.  Part of the McGregor clan, Doniger could trace his roots back to the first kings of Scotland and, possessing both a keen eye for business and strong sense of style, he had made enough money for the voyage to America by making caps out of the McGregor tartan.  Once in the US, Doniger set up a business and introduced his Scottish plaids to New York and beyond.  In February 2013, senior figures at the UFC announced that they had signed McGregor as part of a multi-fight contract.  McGregor, who was born in the Crumlin area of Dublin, became only the second fighter from Ireland to compete for the company after Tom Egan."},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-fans-force-road-closure-in-scrum-for-rare-bottles","story":"  AA traffic reports for the area around the Macallan Distillery in Craigellachie, Moray, said around 300 cars were in the area on Tuesday morning.

Significantly, the report faulted Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the former long-time bishop of Pittsburgh who now leads the Washington archdiocese, for what it said was his part in the concealment of clergy sexual abuse.  Mr Wuerl, one of the highest-profile cardinals in the United States, released a statement on Tuesday that said he had \u0026ldquoacted with diligence, with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse.  The grand jury scrutinised abuse allegations in dioceses that minister to more than half the state\u0026rsquos 3.2 million Catholics. Its report echoed the findings of many earlier church investigations around the country in its description of widespread sexual abuse by clergy and church officials\u0026rsquo concealment of it.  Most of the victims were boys but girls were abused too, the report said.  \u0026ldquoChurch officials routinely and purposefully described the abuse as horseplay and wrestling and inappropriate conduct. It was none of those things. It was child sexual abuse, including rape, Mr Shapiro said.  The panel concluded that a succession of Catholic bishops and other diocesan leaders tried to shield the church from bad publicity and financial liability by covering up abuse, failing to report accused clergy to police and discouraging victims from going to law enforcement.  Yet the grand jury\u0026rsquos work will not result in justice for the vast majority of those who say they were molested by priests as children.  While the probe yielded charges against two clergymen \u0026mdash including a priest who has since pleaded guilty, and another who allegedly forced his accuser to say confession after each sex assault \u0026mdash the other priests identified as perpetrators are either dead or will avoid arrest because their alleged crimes are too old to prosecute under state law.  \u0026ldquoWe are sick over all the crimes that will go unpunished and uncompensated, the grand jury said."},{"url":null,"title":"no-second-independence-referendum-before-early-2020s-says-alex-neil","story":"  Alex Neil issued the \u0026ldquorealistic assessment despite being a speaker at next month\u0026rsquos Hope over Fear rally, which is backing a referendum as soon as possible.  Titled \u0026ldquothis time it\u0026rsquos yes, the organisers of the annual gathering in Glasgow\u0026rsquos George Square say they \u0026ldquosincerely believe it will be the last rally before Indyref2.  Illustrating splits in the Yes movement over the timing of a vote, Mr Neil said there was no serious prospect of Indyref2 before the 2021 election.  He said he had told one organiser, the former Socialist MSP and convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan, how he felt and that was the basis for him speaking on September 15.  Mr Neil, who held cabinet posts under both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, said Theresa May would not grant a Section 30 order giving Holyrood the necessary powers to hold a referendum, and the SNP also needed to do more to prepare the ground for independence.  The strategy should therefore be to seek a clear-cut mandate for a referendum in 2021.  He told the Herald: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think you can seriously call for a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoNicola has made it clear - in my view, correctly - that she would not call for a second referendum without a Section 30 order from London and quite frankly, as things stand, there\u0026rsquos no prospect of getting that before 2021.  \u0026ldquoWe should focus on preparing the ground, so that we can have a successful Indyref2 in the early 2020s.  The Airdrie \u0026amp Shotts MSP went on: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove made it clear what my position is to Tommy, and I\u0026rsquove accepted the invitation on the basis that that\u0026rsquos my position. We want to be independent as quickly as possible, but you\u0026rsquove also got to deal with the realities of life.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom absolutely convinced we can win one [a referendum], but I think the way things are, to get a Section 30 order, we will need to be very explicit in our 2021 manifesto that a vote for the SNP is a vote for Indyref2, and this time probably hold it earlier in the parliament rather than later.  He said that made the SNP government\u0026rsquos performance over the next three years \u0026ldquocritical in persuading people to get behind independence.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf the government adopts a successful strategy of delivering on health and education and jobs, that is a prerequisite of a successful outcome of Indyref2. There\u0026rsquos a lot of water to flow under the bridge between now and 2021.  Ms Sturgeon has said she has a \u0026ldquotriple-lock mandate to call a referendum in the current parliament, and is due to update MSPs on a timetable plans in October.  However she has also said a date requires far greater clarity over Brexit and future UK-EU trade relations, and acknowledged she does not know what she will say in the autumn.  After demanding a fresh referendum in March 2017, she was blindsided by a snap election in which the SNP lost a third of its MPs and had to \u0026ldquoreset her plans.  Mr Neil said the First Minister\u0026rsquos strategy must be flexible enough to cope with a \u0026ldquovery fluid political situation, including the possibility of another Westminster election this year or next.  But with wider Yes movement marches attracting tens of thousands, Ms Sturgeon also faces growing pressure to use her \u0026lsquotriple lock\u0026rsquo mandate before it expires.  Mr Neil said many of those agitating for a rapid referendum were doing so for the wrong reason - fear of Unionists winning a majority at Holyrood in 2021, rather than the conditions being right to win a Yes vote.  \u0026ldquoThey are concerned that we might not get a pro-independence majority in the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections. If you do it for that reason, it\u0026rsquos the wrong reason to do it.  \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore not doing it because you think you can win the referendum, you\u0026rsquore doing it because you\u0026rsquore feart we\u0026rsquore not going to win the 2021 election.  \u0026ldquoThe answer to that is, do what you need to do to win the 2021 election to get the mandate to get Indyref2.  Also due to speak at the Hope Over Fear rally are SNP MSP Sandra White and Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny, who ran unsuccessfully for the SNP deputy leadership earlier this year.  Mr McEleny has repeatedly called for a referendum by the end of 2019.  Mrs May has rejected one call for a Section 30 order, and would doubtless do so again.  However a second rejection could be used by Ms Sturgeon as evidence of a democratic deficit and Westminster high-handedness in the run up to the 2021 election."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-baby-box-celebrates-first-birthday","story":"  The Scottish Government said 52,065 baby boxes have been gifted to date, with an 85% uptake by parents.  The latest survey showed 100% satisfaction with the box, which contains items including clothing, a comforter toy and a play mat, the government said.  Other gifts include books, a towel and a sling carrier, and the box itself can be used as a sleeping space for newborns.  The projected cost of the initiative was \u0026pound8 million for 2017/18, rising to \u0026pound8.8 million for each of the following three years.  Children and Early Years Minister Maree Todd said the baby boxes were having a real impact on the families receiving them, and demonstrated that \"as a society, we value each and every child\".  Ms Todd said: \"I\u0027m delighted to have reached this milestone. It\u0027s an honour for everyone involved - from the organisations providing the items to the box packers to the people delivering the boxes - to have been part of something that is having a real impact on the lives of babies and their carers across the country.\"  A parent survey revealed the most popular items were the room thermometer, followed by the ear thermometer and the sling.  The majority of parents (62%) said they had used or planned to use the box as a bed.  Darren Burt and Mandy Niblo from Falkirk said they were grateful for the digital ear thermometer they received in the box before their three-month-old Harris was born.  They said it would not have occurred to them to buy one, but it turned out to be essential when Harris got an infection. The high reading led them to call 111 and he was admitted to hospital, where he made a recovery.  Ms Niblo said of the box: \"It\u0027s packed full of great quality, useful items including some that you might not think to buy yourself, that could potentially save your child\u0027s life.\"  NHS Lothian chief midwife, Frances McGuire, said: \"The Baby Box has been a great opportunity for our midwives and health visitors to chat to expectant parents about its contents and how they can help improve a child\u0027s health and well-being.  \"Not only that, but the box helps new parents at a time where they may be particularly stretched financially, and can provide crucial support.\""},{"url":null,"title":"new-mandela-book-to-extend-his-legacy-with-children","story":"  Zindzi Mandela, the youngest daughter of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, said many young people do not know the story of her father\u0027s long struggle and believes it can inspire future generations.

Speaking with Allan Little at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on Tuesday, she said: \"There are many young people that know that Nelson Mandela was once president but his story and how he travelled to get to that point is very, very important.  \"It is especially important for the African child to know that in respect of where you come from and the challenges in front of you, that it is possible to realise your highest potential.  \"My own grandchildren just knew him as somebody who loved children, that\u0027s their fondest memory.  \"When he passed away they were very young, so for them every time they see a picture of him they want to know the context and that\u0027s where the book project came from because they asked questions that many other children want to ask and this book is in the form that they best appreciate.\"  Ms Mandela played her own part in South Africa\u0027s freedom struggle and is currently serving as the country\u0027s ambassador to Denmark.  Asked how her father would view South Africa today, Ms Mandela said: \"I think my father would never give up on South Africa.  \"I think we\u0027ve seen some leaders of political movements at the stroke of a hat, because they\u0027ve lost power, they say not to vote for particular parties or organisations.

A splinter dissident republican group opposed to the peace process, the Real IRA, was blamed for the carnage after inaccurate warnings meant police evacuated shoppers towards the bomb site.  Twenty years later, nobody has been convicted of murder and relatives of the dead will gather on the spot this afternoon for a short ceremony\u0026nbspled by Omagh Churches Forum.  It will be followed by the ringing of a bell 32 times to reflect the 31 lives lost and an additional peal to remember all who have lost their lives through similar atrocities.  President Michael D Higgins said: \u0026ldquoAs we recall with deep sadness the deaths and the injuries at Omagh, we should use this moment to recognise the many ways in which we are all connected and the many ways in which we have sought to make peaceful progress over the last two decades.  \u0026ldquoMay we use this anniversary as we honour the victims, to re-emphasise the importance of building a culture of peace and tolerance on our island.  The victims included Protestants and Catholics, tourists from Spain and others on a day trip from the nearby Republic of Ireland.  One of the biggest police manhunts in history unfolded, but criticism of the police investigation led to unfulfilled calls for a public inquiry.  Two faced prosecution for murder but were not convicted.  Catholic Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown held a special Mass in the town on Tuesday evening.  He told parishioners at the Sacred Heart Church: \u0026ldquoYour memorial here is a monument to all the innocent who were torn from us by violence in our community.  \u0026ldquoCombatants do fighting but it is mostly civilians who do the dying.  Twenty years on, the Stormont power-sharing administration which was a centrepiece of the Belfast Agreement is suspended with little sign of its restoration.  Dissident republicans continue to pose a serious threat to life, primarily to members of the security forces.  Nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said: \u0026ldquoThe pain of Omagh families and victims should serve us with an important reminder that the road to peace is worth protecting at all costs.  He said the resilience of all affected provided the \u0026ldquoultimate example that reconciliation and agreement in the face of adversity was always possible.  Wednesday\u0026rsquos commemoration will begin at 2.55pm at the site of the bombing at Market Street.  The bell will stop tolling at 3.10pm, the time the bomb exploded.  The commemoration will feature a song, then people will be offered a flower petal to scatter into a river or a pond at a nearby memorial garden.

While girls are still around twice as likely to want to study languages at university as boys, there has been a significant drop-off for both sexes.  Experts said the decreases are concerning and that the UK needs to \u0026ldquonurture a new generation of fluent speakers.  The Press Association\u0026rsquos analysis shows there were 17,505 applications to study European languages, literature and related courses last year, down 30% from 24,895 in 2007.  And applications for non-European languages, literature and related degrees have dropped by 38% to 5,515 last year \u0026ndash compared with 8,945 a decade ago.  The analysis looked at all applications made through Ucas\u0026rsquos main application scheme between 2007 and 2017.  The figures come just days before teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland learn their A-level results.  A gender breakdown shows that applications from boys to study European language courses have dropped by 27%, while for non-European languages the numbers are down 50%.  Among girls, applications have fallen by 31% for both European and non-European languages.  Mark Herbert, director of schools and skills at the British Council, said: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the UK is looking to forge new relationships around the world, it\u0026rsquos concerning that the number of young people applying for language degrees is actually declining.  \u0026ldquoWe need to nurture a new generation of fluent speakers, particularly in important languages such as Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, French and German, which our analysis shows will be crucial for the UK\u0026rsquos success post-Brexit.  \u0026ldquoHaving language skills and an understanding of other cultures gives graduates an advantage in the labour market, particularly when they are competing against people from other parts of the world who often speak excellent English \u0026ndash and have several other languages too.

For not only will it commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One, but it will also mark the centenary of the restoration of Poland’s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic from the German, Austrian and Russian Empires.                                       \t      \t\tLabour of love...for Keith Burns, project manager from MAPA Scotland, the charity founded to restore the Great Polish Map of Scotland in 2010. Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Wednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Wednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

He is the chieftain of the Mey Games and last year was asked to become the patron of the Scottish Highland Games Association.He said Prince Charles is aware of the community links to the Mey Games and its sporting and cultural significance.\u0026ldquoThe prince wants to encourage young people to take part in Highland Games in future and was driven by what he saw happening at Mey, Mr Lovie said.After the launch, The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation, High Life Highland, Highland Council and the Scottish Highland Games Association will look at ways to develop the plans further. It may be possible at some point to have a junior games.The idea will be taken into secondary schools to start with, although in the longer term primaries would be included as well.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland. Many will never have experienced the enjoyment of participating in traditional Highland sports. I am excited about playing my part in helping introduce these sports to the next generation of Highland Games competitors.The Mey Games is one of only two Highland events in Scotland with royal patronage \u0026ndash the other being the Braemar Gathering.Wednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sheriff finds fault with Wick motorists","story":"A SHERIFF has criticised some Wick drivers who appear to have scant regard for road traffic regulations.Sheriff Andrew Berry spoke out at the town\u0026rsquos sheriff court during a case involve a teenage moped driver who had travelled along a pavement kerb at excessive speed.The sheriff remarked: \u0026ldquoI probably should not be surprised as it would appear that there is a different view taken of road traffic regulations in the town of Wick and the rest of the country.Sheriff Berry went on to highlight the problem of drivers regularly parking on the opposite side of Bridge Street, Wick \u0026ndash in some cases all day.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI could go out now and count 15 vehicles.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Wednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Wednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this.

People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Wednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Wednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Now locals on Tiree are looking for a new minister to lead the Church of Scotland congregation on the island, which covers an area of 30 square miles.            While one of the Kirk’s more remote postings, whoever takes up the job will be able to enjoy living in a manse just yards from the beach as well as performing a prominent role in the tight-knit community, which has a Christian tradition dating back to the sixth century.            Jo Bennett, clerk of the congregation’s nominating committee, said: “People talk about Iona as a thin place – a place where the distance between heaven and earth collapses.  “I think Tiree has that too, but it’s also very much a working community - you get both aspects here.“A minister here has the chance to see the impact of the work they do and be the focal point for the community.”READ MORE: Message in a bottle sent from Iceland washes up on Tiree after a yearMr Bennett said the congregation was regularly boosted in the summer months by visitors from around the world.             “In Summer we get visitors from around the world but in winter it may be much smaller,” he added.“It’s always a mixture of people who visit regularly and people visiting for the first time.”The manse is situated outside the village of Scarinish, just yards from the sea and with views to the Treshnish Isles, Mull and Iona across the passage of Tiree.Although the church building only dates to 1902, Tiree has a long Christian tradition going back to St Columba and his companion Beithene, who was the abbot on the island in the sixth century.            The local population boasts the highest proportion of Gaelic speakers in the Inner Hebrides.An advert for the position states: “We seek a minister who finds that their heart resonates with this island and this community who can meet us where we are and help guide us towards where we should be who can “be Christ” in this place to people who need His love.“Tiree is not a place that allows for anything other than going ‘all in’.“People will know when you leave the Manse they’ll know where you’ve been visiting what you’ve been buying in the Co-op and when your cooker has stopped working.“But they will also wave and stop for a chat when they see you notice the work you put in to visiting and come by with food or invite you round for dinner when your cooker isn’t working.” "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783850.1534253410!/image/image.jpg","title":"alan bairner the true home of football is not scotland or england","story":"        Some say Scotland invented the game of football that \u0026#8220was to charm every continent\u0026#8221, while others claim England is the true home of the sport. Here Alan Bairner argues the title should be shared.                In his book, How Scots Invented the Modern World, American writer Arthur Herman credited the inventiveness of Sots in numerous fields including science, education, medicine, and philosophy and medicine. In so doing, he argued, the Scots were responsible for modern ideas about democracy, free market capitalism and the importance of developing a literate society.            Another invention he could have added was the Football League – the First Division of which was the forerunner of the English Premier League (EPL), widely regarded as the most successful domestic football competition in the world – which was invented by a Scotsman living in England.            Even though the English first codified the modern game of association football, there is no doubt that – like golf – football gave Scotland what Kevin McCarra, in his 1984 pictorial history of Scottish football, described as “a place in the world”.The league process developed rapidly in England itself with Scottish players arriving in large numbers to play for clubs in the north-east and in Lancashire in the 1880s. Professionalism was still officially illegal in both countries but English clubs were more successful than their Scottish counterparts at circumventing this obstacle, not least by paying “expenses” and offering paid employment in firms owned by club directors.Most noteworthy of all, however, is the role played by William McGregor. Born in Braco in Perthshire in 1846, McGregor moved to Birmingham where he set up in business as a draper and became a committee member of Aston Villa Football Club in 1877. On March 23 1888, he organised a meeting in London with representatives of ten leading English clubs including West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End. A subsequent meeting in Manchester on 17 April resulted in the formation of the Football League.READ MORE: Letter: Football isn’t ‘coming home’ – it was invented in ScotlandAs chairman the Football League from 1888-1891, McGregor presided over the transition of English football from a (mainly) amateur pursuit to a truly professionalised sport. He was also chairman of the Football Association (1888-1894) and was honorary president of the Football League (1891-1894). He was elected the first life member of the league in 1895 and died in 1911. He is remembered today by a statue unveiled in 2009 at the directors’ entrance to the Trinity Road Stand at Villa Park in Birmingham.            Thereafter it was the export of players that increased Scottish influence on football in England. The first Liverpool side to play a league game was comprised ten Scots and a Merseyside-born goalkeeper by the name of Billy McOwen. As former Portsmouth captain and players’ union activist Jimmy Guthrie put it: “After whisky, footballers have been the favourite and most expensive export from Scotland to England.”James Lang is generally regarded as the first ever professional footballer. Born in 1851 in Clydebank, Lang moved from Scotland to the nominally amateur Sheffield Wednesday and gained employment in a company belonging to one of the club’s directors before then moving to the openly professional Burnley Football Club.Ever since – or at least until relatively recently – Scottish players have continued to make their mark on English domestic football. Alex James of Arsenal won four league titles and three FA Cup winners medals as well as runners-up medals in each competition between 1931 and 1936. Dave Mackay, John White and Bill Brown were regular members of the Tottenham Hotspur team that won the first league and cup double in the modern era in 1960-1.Alan Hansen won eight league titles and three European Cup winners medals with Liverpool with whom his compatriot, Kenny Dalglish won six league titles and three European Cup medals as a player. As manager between 1985 and 1990, he then led the club to its first double in 1985-6 and to two other league titles in 1987-8 and 1989-90. Under his stewardship, Liverpool also won the FA Cup in 1989.            As with Dalglish’s example, it is the legacy of Scottish managers that is most apparent in the relatively short history of the EPL. For example, as manager of Liverpool, Dalglish was building on a legacy inherited from Bill Shankly. Overall in the 20 years preceding the formation of the EPL, Liverpool won the old League Division One title on nine occasions. Meanwhile, another Scot – Matt Busby – led Manchester United to the first ever European Cup success for an English team.READ MORE: Euphoria to defeat: the untold story of Scotland’s 1978 World CupUndoubtedly the successes of these two clubs were influential in helping to precipitate the formation of the Premier League which would allow already successful clubs such as Liverpool and Manchester United to become more successful and even richer. So it was ironic that, in the EPL’s third season, the title went to Blackburn Rovers – managed by none other than Dalglish.But it is another Scot who made a bigger mark on the league to date than any owner, manager or player. Having previously managed in his native country, Alex Ferguson was appointed manager of Manchester United in November 1986. During 27 years at the helm (1986-2013), the club won 38 trophies, including 13 EPL titles and the European Champions’ League in 1998-9 and 2007-8.So you can mount a pretty good argument that the history of football in England would have been very different without the contribution made by Scots – and the EPL is but the latest stage in that history. Without going as far as sportswriter Patrick Barclay who claimed in The Independent that Scots invented the game itself – “the football that was to charm every continent” – it is surely the case that, given the history of the Football League and beyond, if football ever does “come home”, it will be to Great Britain as a whole and not to England alone.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

What will be the future of artistic expression in this country if the institutions tasked with promoting it preside over a culture of exclusivity and inaccessibility?            It is a question that has been raised this week by Maureen Beattie, the newly installed president of Equity, who warned that youngsters from working class households who aspire to careers on the stage and screen are being locked out of the profession due to the prohibitive cost of education.            Maureen Beattie stressed that compared to her formative years in the profession, an era in which arts funding was plentiful, the budding young actors of today are being excluded on account of their low-incomes and backgrounds. In an interview with , Ms Beattie, who was elected unopposed to the union’s presidency last month, said: “We are increasingly finding that it is more and more difficult for people from working class backgrounds to get into the business. “The mountain they have got to climb, to put themselves through, the bursaries are less and less and the grants have just disappeared. People are being cut off in the bud before they even have a bash at it.”Ms Beattie, the daughter of Johnny, the veteran Scottish comedian, entertainer and actor, trained in the 1970s at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, nowadays known as the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.Even though her father and mother, Kitty Lamont, a model and theatrical agent, were not short of a “bob or two” at the time, the 65-year-old said she had “practically all of my fees paid” for her.            How galling it must be for the young actors of today to hear such stories of state-sanctioned benevolence and artistic encouragement. Ms Beattie, by her own admission, was not from a disadvantaged background, but plenty of her award-winning peers were. They too were given the freedom and opportunity to be judged on talent alone, a level playing field that has been taken away from successive generations. The ubiquity of old Etonians such as Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston is often lazily seized upon as a sign of the paucity of working class voices in the acting game, but a growing body of research offers far more convincing – and damning – evidence.            READ MORE: Martyn McLaughlin: Sinister plan to turn council staff into MI5 agentsRecent research by the Sutton Trust found that as many as 42 per cent of British BAFTA winners attended a private school, while a 2016 study by the London School of Economics and the University of Edinburgh, based on the Office for National Statistics’ labour force survey, found 51 per cent of actors were from privileged backgrounds, with just 16 per cent identifying as working class.With the costs of drama school so high nowadays, particularly in London, where the problem of exorbitant fees is compounded by absurd rent rates, simply trying to get a foot in the door when you hail from a certain socio-economic group can be ruinous pursuit from the get go. For all that the theatre establishment supposedly cherishes diversity, it remains almost inconceivable that some of Britain’s leading drama schools continue to charge audition fees for prospective students.There are more than a dozen prestigious establishments who profit in such a way, including famous names like the Guidhall School of Music and Drama, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and notably, Ms Beattie’s alma mater.            On its website, the esteemed institution promises that its three-year BA acting programme – a course whose previous students include stars such as James McAvoy and David Tennant – is “one of the best professional actor training programmes in the UK”.Such privilege comes at a price, however. In addition to the travel and potential accommodation expenses of attending an audition in Glasgow, the candidates must also pay £55, whether they receive a call back or not. That is on top of a £25 “application fee”. In fairness to the Royal Conservatoire, it has a fair access plan to promote equality and diversity, and since 2013, it has runs a programme called Transitions 20/40, designed to usher in students from areas of multiple deprivation into its undergraduate programme.READ MORE: Martyn McLaughlin: Podcasts are window into the weird and wonderfulThere has been improvement on this front – some 28 per cent of its undergraduate applicants last year hailed from the most deprived areas of Scotland, compared to 25 per cent in 2014/15 – but progress has been glacial, and such students continue to be under represented.Welcome as such measures are, they seem to put the cart before the horse. Surely the Royal Conservatoire could take a stand, as Liverpool Theatre School has done, and abolish its audition fees altogether? With tuition fees running into the thousands, such sums may seem trifling, but the problem with such initiatives is not their expense, but the message that they send out. At the lowliest rung of a profession where the prospect of a living wage, let alone the promise of fame, is precarious, the ladder is being pulled up from those without the means to showcase their abilities.In order to address to working class deficit in the acting profession, there are other, arguably bigger problems that must be addressed, not least the dwindling stream of National Lottery funding to Creative Scotland, but if change is to come, ensuring all young actors have the chance to be heard seems a reasonable and symbolic first step."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783035.1534318876!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit travel insurance hike could leave holidaymakers out of pocket","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Brexit could leave holidaymakers facing higher prices as a result of a hike in travel insurance costs.                Professor John Lennon, director of the Moffat Centre for Travel and Tourism at Glasgow Caledonian University, warned the days of cheap travel insurance could be over, with tourists left paying more to cover flight delays and medical repatriation costs.            More than 29 million Britons holiday in EU countries every year, accounting for 76 per cent of the outbound travel market. Around 17 million book package holidays, but industry insiders believe cut-price offers could disappear.            Flights could also face significant disruption as UK negotiators face the “colossal” task of securing new air access agreements to destinations worldwide.Prof Lennon said: “People see holidays as a primary purchase. They will still go on holiday, but it’s going to get more expensive.“Almost all major UK outbound destinations are more expensive, with the exception of Turkey. The cost of flying, travel insurance and data roaming charges are likely to rise post-Brexit. Travellers will also face increased costs for food, beverages and accommodation because of the weakness of Sterling.”All flights to European Union countries, the US and Canada are through negotiated deals with the EU and there is growing concern about the impact of Brexit on UK airlines.Prof Lennon said: “As the UK leaves the EU, the potential for far worse access agreements could seriously damage the flying rights of UK airlines.            “The scale of the negotiating task that faces the British government is colossal. There are more than 60 air access agreements to be renegotiated.”Industry experts have previously raised concerns over the future of the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), which offers free emergency medical cover in the EU.The EHIC allows Britons to receive free or reduced healthcare while in the EU. The UK has issued 27 million EHICs. A House of Lords report in March warned a no-deal Brexit would end the EHIC. “In the absence of an agreement on future relations that covers this topic, the rights currently enjoyed by 27 million UK citizens, thanks to the EHIC, will cease after Brexit,” the report said.Prof Lennon said: “The travel industry is just like any other business. Its customers hate uncertainty. If things like access, charges and insurance cover are uncertain, it will impact on travel patterns.”            The Moffat Centre  is responsible for compiling the Scottish accommodation occupancy and visitor attraction performance statistics.A UK Government spokesperson said: “This analysis is misleading. We are absolutely committed to ensuring that tourism continues to thrive when the UK leaves the European Union.“Our White Paper clearly sets out that the UK’s position is to seek reciprocal visa-free travel arrangements, a comprehensive agreement on air transport ... and for UK and EU nationals to continue to be able to use the European Health Insurance Card.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784199.1534317805!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence blueprint absent from snp conference","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It’s a pleasure to welcome it into our collection.”            The Scottish Government said 85 per cent of expectant parents have taken up the opportunity to receive the baby box, while the latest parent survey showed 100% satisfaction.Children and Early Years Minister Maree Todd said: “I am absolutely delighted that our baby box will have a place preserved in history here at the Museum of Childhood.“This box has made such a difference to people’s lives in the past year, and to know that this will now be on exhibition as a legacy of the babies of Scotland should make everyone involved in creating, packing and delivering the baby box very proud.“We are committed to ensuring every baby has the best start in life, and I’ve seen over the past year the difference this box and its contents has made to the lives of babies and their parents and carers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nWednesday 15 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Carmichaels NI Limited, recently carried out extensive refurbishment works which has revamped existing facilities, including the lobby and main function space.\n  \nThe investment by Ulster Bank also supported the creation of a unique wedding pavilion, allowing civil marriage ceremonies to take place in a stand-alone venue at the hotel which is situated on the outskirts of Ballymena.\n  \nWith capacity for up to 120 guests, the wedding pavilion overlooks a wooded area and tranquil gardens, boasts a stained glass window and has many other features designed to create a romantic, peaceful setting.\n  \n The pavilion carries state of the art technology including camera equipment to live-stream your wedding all over the world for any family or friends who may be living overseas.\n  \nDirector of Carmichaels NI Limited, Keith Carmichael, is expecting the wedding pavilion to attract many couples to the Ross Park Hotel.\n  \n“Weddings are a key part of our customer base at the Ross Park , and as such, we wanted to maximise our offering to would-be clients.\n  \nHaving noticed an increase in the number of couples opting for a civil ceremony rather than a church wedding, we decided to add on a purpose-built wedding pavilion away from the hustle and bustle of the main hotel.\n  \n“Thanks to the financial support received from Ulster Bank, the pavilion itself has been finished to an exceptionally high standard and its many unique features make it the perfect location for any couple to tie the knot.”\n  \nAndy Tew, Business Development Manager with Ulster Bank said the bank was pleased to support a project of this nature. “The work at the Ross Park Hotel has been carried out to an exceptionally high standard and we’re proud to have played a role in this upgrade.\n  \n“The enhanced facilities make the Ross Park a very attractive choice for any kind of wedding celebration and will add significant value to the local area.\n  \n“In broader terms, we are seeing huge growth across the local hospitality sector and we at Ulster Bank are keen to work with businesses and help them benefit from this increase in demand.”\n  \nIt is hoped that the wedding pavilion will boost staffing levels at the hotel with owners expecting to create more jobs in the autumn.\n  \nFor more information about the hotel or the wedding pavilion, visit http://www.rosspark/

He admits that until results day, he’d never really considered the College as an option but following his positive experience there, he would have no hesitation recommending it to others. \n  \n“We covered a variety of topics which helped me decide which area of engineering I wanted to focus on. The lecturers’ industrial experience was very useful and it helps that the class sizes are smaller than at university.”\n  \nHaving decided to focus on civil engineering, James applied for an apprenticeship with BT. His application was successful and since March this year, he juggled coursework with his commitments as an apprentice planner with BT to complete first year of the Foundation Degree. \n  \nHe says that being a student at Northern Regional College opened his eyes to the different career opportunities available. James now plans to finish his apprenticeship with BT and looking further ahead, hopes to complete a degree in Engineering. \n  \nNorthern Regional College offers a wide range of full time and part time further and higher education courses. These include entry level courses right up to Foundation and Degree programmes, covering different vocational areas such as Construction, Engineering, Sport, Health \u0026amp Social Care, Counselling, Computing and Business.\n  \nIf you already know what subject you are interested in, you will find details of all the courses offered at the College on www.nrc.ac.uk but if you are undecided the College’s team of professional careers advisors are available on enrolment days and can guide you through the different options to choose a course that is best for you. \n  \nEnrolment days will be held at all campuses on Thursday August 16 (HE) and Thursday August 23 (FE/Training/Apprenticeships) from 9 am – 7 pm. \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921266.jpg--.jpg?1534230402000\n","title":"summer carnival rolls into town","story":"  \nFOLLOWING the success of last year’s Summer Carnival in Ballymena, the exciting and fun-filled family day out returns to the town centre on Saturday, August 25.\n  \nThe FREE one-day event, organised by Ballymena Business Improvement District (BID), will take place in Bryan Street, Wellington Court, the new ‘Harmony Hub’ and surrounding areas from 12pm to 4pm with something for everyone to enjoy.\n  \nWith a wide range of on-street entertainment including carnival games and crafts, face painting, fun characters, live music, themed attractions and a pet farm, there will be plenty on offer for visitors throughout the day.\n  \nAlison Moore, Ballymena BID Manager said: “We are very excited to bring the Summer Carnival back to Ballymena town centre for a second year.\n  \n “The event was extremely well received last year and enjoyed by those who attended so we’re determined to make sure this year is bigger and better.\n  \n“We love having the opportunity to entertain visitors and the Summer Carnival creates a fantastic atmosphere within the town.”\n  \nAlison continued, “Our local retailers and businesses helped to make the Summer Carnival the success it was last year by getting involved either by holding their own promotions and special offers, as well as setting up stalls outside their stores. \n  \n“Many businesses also donated prizes for the Roadshow Giveaway with Cool FM and we have some excellent prizes up for grabs this year too!”\n  \nThe Cool FM Roadshow with presenter Pete Snodden will be live from the Harmony Hub from 1.30pm to 3.30pm.\n  \nAlison concluded, “Ballymena is the town that has something for everyone and we have no doubt the Summer Carnival will be an upbeat way to celebrate the end of the summer season. \n  \n“There will also be lots of live music around the town which we hope everyone will enjoy. \n  \n“We are really looking forward to the return of our summer carnival and hope you and your family will come along and enjoy what is going to be a fantastic day.”\n  \nFor more information on the special offers and promotions taking place during the Summer Carnival, follow Ballymena Means on Facebook or visit the Ballymena Means website.\n  \nIf you would like your business to be involved in the Summer Carnival, please contact Alison Moore bidsmanager@\n  \nballymenameans with details of your offer and we will include your information in our online promotions.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This is the biggest thing I’ve ever had to look forward to and hopefully something that will genuinely change my life, for the better, forever. I’m particularly excited to become a DWU Tiger and play for the school soccer team - I think that’ll be cool and something so different to teams at home.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I decided to apply for Study USA because I’d heard that it was an amazing experience and I know without a doubt the programme will have a positive impact on my future -  It’ll make me look more attractive to employers showing I took the chance to go and grow as person both independently and communicatively.\n\n“Hopefully it will also broaden my own personal network which in itself is an intangible asset to any business employing me as they gain potential connections in America, should they be necessary.”\n\nThe British Council, which is the UK’s international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, manages Study USA on behalf of the Department for the Economy. Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

Then,  around 300 workers,   mostly women,  losing their jobs.\n\nThe Business Centre  wants to compile a multi-media history project, recording the workers’ experiences. They want people who worked there to join a reminiscence/oral history project to record what it was like in the factory during the 1950’s, 60’s and 70’s, and the impact its closure had.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “The intention would be for the former workers to meet on a regular basis over coming months and to talk and chat about their times in Mayfair. It will be very informal and a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“We intend that the project will be very much led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places in the town as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair, which will not only include the video-recorded interviews but also old photo’s and other items.”\n\nAnyone interested in joining the project should contact Ursula Kearns at Mayfair by telephone on 028 38 391666 or email ursula@mayfairbusinesscentre\n\nThe Tyrone-based BEAM Creative Networks will help facilitate delivery of the project and provide video-recording, design and other support. The present Mayfair Business Centre was established in 1995 as a community-owned enterprise and officially opened in 1996. The Business Centre has gone through a number of phases of development in the intervening years.  It has proven to be a success with twenty-eight businesses occupying a total of 38 units in the Mayfair complex - around 48,000 sq ft of space.\n\nMatch-funding for this project has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8600534.1534250322!/image/image.jpg","title":"up to 1 500 jobs in jeopardy as homebase to shut 42 stores","story":"\nHomebase has earmarked 42 stores for closure with the loss of 1,500 jobs, as the firm deals with debt restructuring - but none in NI are set to shut.\n\n                \nThe DIY firm has nine stores in NI including two in Belfast, one in Craigavon, Derry, Omagh, Antrim, Newtownabbey, Cookstown and Bangor.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn a lunchtime press release, the firm announced it would be entering a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA) - a special insolvency procedure.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHomebase has a number of stores in the Republic of Ireland and 250 stores in the rest of the UK.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHomebase said it was announcing the next phase of its restructuring plan and will be seeking approval from creditors on the proposed plan to reduce its cost base in the UK and the Irish Republic.\n\nTheir statement said: “Homebase’s sales performance and profitability declined significantly under the previous ownership over the last two years. In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37214170.ece/6b178/AUTOCROP/w65square/ruth_lee.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37208464.ece/b2fa0/AUTOCROP/w620/omagh_bomb_memorial_001.jpg","title":"bell set to sound across omagh on anniversary of real ira massacre","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

A bell will then ring 32 times to reflect the 31 lives lost in Omagh, with the additional ring in remembrance of those who have and continue to lose their lives through terror attacks across the world.\n\nMr Skelton added: \"We will have two minutes\u0027 silence at the time the bomb exploded followed by Scripture readings, prayers, hymns and a benediction led by clergy from both faiths, which has been organised by the Churches\u0027 Forum.\n\n\n \nAt the funeral of Omagh suspect Seamus McKenna his sister pushed through the colour party, knelt at his grave and prayed... showing a deep, unspoken pain at what had been done\n \n\n\n\"Our commemorations will conclude with white petals set in small boxes offered to the people who have gathered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are free do to what they wish with these petals - they can be dropped into the river or the pond in the Memorial Garden or they are free to take them home with them and put them in a book as a keepsake.\n\n\"We want the white petals to be a symbol of hope looking forward to a better future,\" he said.\n\n\n \nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint: Two decades on, the pain and anguish of Omagh raw as ever\n \n\n\nThe victims and survivors of Omagh will also be remembered today at St Anne\u0027s Cathedral, Belfast, where a two minute silence will also take place at 3.10pm -the time the bomb exploded.\n\nA total of 31 candles will be lit at the day\u0027s first service at 8.10am. The candles will sit symbolically at the base of the Cathedral\u0027s Spire of Hope. \n\nFor anyone affected by the atrocity, the devastation they witnessed will never be forgotten.\n\nSpeaking ahead of today\u0027s anniversary, the senior surgeon at Tyrone County Hospital on the day of the bomb recalled scenes which were \"like a battlefield\".\n\nDr Dominic Pinto said he walked into \"bedlam\" at the hospital that day, before performing operation after operation, working to save as many lives as possible.\n\nThe 81-year-old, who is now retired, recalled he had been at a father-and-son golf day with his GP and his son when he heard the explosion.\n\n\"We were on the fourth hole, I had just driven off when I heard the boom,\" he said. \"I saw the cloud of dust from the middle of the town area.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 20th anniversary of the Omagh bomb was held in the memorial garden in Omagh.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

Why should a pro-abortion party be allowed to hijack history?\n\n\"The civil rights legacy belongs to all of us and this is an excellent opportunity to highlight the pro-life cause, which enjoys widespread support in Tyrone and across the north. The timing is very fortuitous at this crucial time in the abortion debate.\n\n\"We have people travelling from around Ireland to be with us and we expect a large number of local people to join in as the Coalisland/Dungannon area is a pro-life stronghold. \n\n\"We shall not be moved and we shall overcome.\"\n\nSinn Fein declined to comment on the actions planned by the pro-life groups.\n\nHowever, the party\u0027s Mid Ulster MP Francie Molloy said: \"Civil rights as a movement was driven by ordinary people and they achieved an awful lot. \n\n\"When people joined together in peaceful protest, they were attacked on the streets - the violence came to us. \n\n\"We marched for our rights and risked everything, but the foresight shown by a brave few is remarkable. Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing, and the ongoing issue around constituency boundary proposals, it is clear that there is still a job of work to be done. \n\n\"The political situation at the time of the Civil Rights Movement included gerrymandered constituencies, which led to systematic discrimination in the allocation of housing, jobs and rights - there can be no return to this.\"\n\nThe march will leave Dungannon at 3pm on Saturday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"numbers behind the popes ireland visit revealed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Being from Galway we connected that to the Claddagh Ring. It\u0027s all about putting your arms around somebody. We started thinking about these different elements then we very quickly realised that the altar will be circular. \n\n\"Normally a lot of stages you see around the world are rectangle shapes. We knew then that we wanted to have that warming, feng shui type of a thing,\" he said. \"Life isn\u0027t about how many breaths you take, it\u0027s about how many times life takes your breath away. \n\n\"We want to bring different emotions into people. For us the visual of this is really important.\"\n\nOlder people are being urged to consult their GPs before embarking on a lengthy trek to see Pope Francis in the Phoenix Park. \n\nHealth chiefs have warned that people will have to walk up to 14km by the time they attend Mass and work their way back to a public transport hub. \n\nChief emergency management officer Brendan Lawlor said people \"need to engage with their healthcare provider\". \"For people who feel they may not be able to do this, we\u0027ve moved on in 40 years. The television coverage of event is going to be absolutely massive and close-up,\" he said. \n\n\"You\u0027ll see every aspect of the event so people shouldn\u0027t lose out.\"\n\nMore than 1,000 medical providers will be working within the confines of the Phoenix Park on Sunday, August 26. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26.

giant Intel has confirmed a new vulnerability in its processor chips, the third major flaw to be confirmed this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nNicknamed Foreshadow, the flaw is said to be similar to the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities uncovered in January that affected millions of computers and could be used to access personal information.\n\nIntel confimed it has already released a patch to fix the issue.\n\nForeshadow is said to affect processors from 2015 onwards, and Intel has posted a list of affected hardware on its website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Lewis Whyld/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe company’s head of product assurance and security, Leslie Culbertson, said Intel did not believe the flaw had been used to hack any personal information but encouraged people and businesses to download any security updates they receive.\n\n“We are not aware of reports that any of these methods have been used in real-world exploits, but this further underscores the need for everyone to adhere to security best practices,” she said.\n\n“This includes keeping systems up to date and taking steps to prevent malware.”\n\nThe new vulnerability was discovered and reported by a group of researchers led by a team from KU Leuven University in Belgium.\n\nSimilarly to the Spectre and Meltdown flaws reported in January, the researchers said Foreshadow exploits a function called speculative execution – which is normally used to optimise computer performance – to access sensitive information on a system’s memory that would normally be out of reach, including passwords and other data.\n\nIntel has said that as well as issuing patches, it is changing the hardware design of its processors to prevent any vulnerability to the existing flaws.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rail fares to increase by 32","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

See story RAIL Fares. Infographic from PA Graphics\n\n\n\n\nA 3.2% increase in season tickets will see annual passes from Brighton to London cost £4,846 (up £150), Gloucester to Birmingham reach £4,239 (up £131) and Liverpool to Manchester setting workers back £3,253 (up £101).\n\nThe announcement came as unions pledged to press ahead with above-inflation pay claims amid growing anger at a call by the Transport Secretary for lower wage rises.\n\nChris Grayling wrote to union general secretaries on Tuesday, stating he wants to “see lower levels of increase for passengers in future” by using the lower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figure, rather than RPI.\n\nBut he suggested this can only happen if pay rises are also based on CPI.\n\nThe Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union accused Mr Grayling of trying to cap pay rises and blame workers for high fares.\n\n\n\n@RMTunion\n says that today\u0027s Government fare hike is another nail in the coffin of Britain\u0027s rip-off privatised railways\nhttps://t.co/iJYxAGmrUD\n \npic.twitter/2YDTrYDhV4\n\n— RMT (@RMTunion) \nAugust 15, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the increase in regulated fares as “an insult to everyone who has suffered from the chaos on Britain’s railways”.\n\nHe went on: “The Government’s shambolic mismanagement of our railways has been a national embarrassment and they must now step in to freeze fares charged on the worst performing routes.\n\n“Labour will take back control of our railways by bringing them into public ownership so they are run in the interests of passengers, not private profit.”\n\nThe introduction of a new timetable in May caused widespread chaos in the north of England and on various London commuter lines. Thousands of passengers are still waiting to receive enhanced compensation.\n\nThe disruption led to the Government vetoing further timetable changes expected in December, which means upgrades in areas such as the West Midlands, the west of England and South Western Railway routes have been cancelled or delayed indefinitely.\n\nPressure group Railfuture claimed train passengers are being treated like “second-class citizens compared to motorists”.\n\nSpokesman Bruce Williamson said: “We’ll easily have the most expensive fares in Europe, yet the Government continues to freeze fuel duty for motorists. Why the double standard?”\n\nRMT general secretary Mick Cash said: “With passengers already furious at the shocking level of service on Britain’s rip-off privatised railways, today’s news is just another kick in the teeth that will come back to haunt both the Tory Government and the train companies alike.”\n\nPaul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the railway, said: “Fares are underpinning a once-in-a-generation investment plan to improve the railway and politicians effectively determine that season ticket prices should change in line with other day-to-day costs to help fund this.\n\n\n98p of every £1 paid in fares goes back into running and improving the railway – for new trains, better services and refurbished stations.

Yes, you read that correctly: development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause while the “highly toxic” lump has been reduced to a fraction of its original self, it’s still doing stuff.\n\n“Whilst on display the fatberg hatched flies, sweated and changed colour,” the Museum of London’s website read. “Since going off display, fatberg has started to grow an unusual and toxic mould, in the form of visible yellow pustules. \n\n“Our collections care team has identified this as aspergillus. Conservators believe that fatberg started to grow the spores whilst on display and now a month later, these spores have become more visible. Any changes to the samples will now be able to be viewed live.”\n\nThe museum encouraged people to check back in on the livestream to see how it develops.

The space capsule that will transport India’s astronauts was tested a few days earlier.\n\nRakesh Sharma was the first Indian to travel in space, aboard a Soviet rocket in 1984. As part of its own space programme, active since the 1960s, India has launched scores of satellites for itself and other countries and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014.\n\nIt hopes to showcase its technological ability to explore the solar system while also using research from space and elsewhere to solve problems at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPM Narendra Modi waves to the crowds after addressing the nation on India’s independence day (Manish Swarup/AP)\n\n\n\n\nThe £790 million-a-year space programme has already helped develop satellite, communication and remote-sensing technologies and has been used to gauge underground water levels and predict weather in the country prone to cycles of drought and flood.\n\nIndia won independence from British colonialists in 1947. Mr Modi’s 80-minute speech, broadcast live from the historic Red Fort in New Delhi, comes months before national elections.\n\nMr Modi listed his government’s achievements in the past four years in reforming the country’s economy, reducing poverty and corruption. He announced a health insurance scheme for 500 million poor people providing a cover of 500,000 rupees (£5,600) per family a year.\n\nHe said India will become a growth engine for the world economy as the “sleeping elephant” has started to run on the back of structural economic reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian children sit in formation to spell out the Hindi word Bharat – the name of the country (Manish Swarup/AP)\n\n\n\n\nHe said its economy was seen as fragile before 2014 but is now attracting investment. India is the sixth-largest economy in the world and Mr Modi said international institutions see India as giving strength to the world economy for the next three decades.\n\nHe said the structural reforms like a national tax replacing various state and local taxes, bankruptcy and insolvency laws, and a crackdown on corruption have helped transform the economy.\n\nMr Modi became prime minister when his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party won a resounding victory in the national elections in 2014. He will seek another five-year term for his party at elections due by March-April next year.\n"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvczMtZXUtd2VzdC0xLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb21cXFwvc3RvcmFnZS5wdWJsaXNoZXJwbHVzLmllXFxcL21lZGlhLnJpdmVybWVkaWEuaWVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE4XFxcLzA4XFxcLzE0MTQyNjE5XFxcL3JlbGljcy5wbmdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuZGVycnlub3cuY29tXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz92PTFcIn0iLCJoYXNoIjoiODZkOGQxNjMxZWI4ZDhhZGZhYWI3MGUwY2Q5NGJmMWM2MDM3Yjk3OSJ9/relics.png","title":"bishop derry donal mckeown welcomes relics saints therese zelie louis martin st eugenes cathedral today","story":"\nThe Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown has welcomed the relics of Saints Therese, Zelie and Louis Martin to St Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry today.\n\nAt 6pm tonight, the relics will leave the Cathedral and make their way to the Carmelite Friary in Termonbacca. \n\nEveryone is invited to come along.\n\nCommenting, the Bishop said: \"The presence of these relics among us today is a unique occasion.\" \n\n\"Just as last month we celebrated Joachim and Anne as the parents of Our Lady, so today we welcome back the Saint of the Little Way – and the parents who moulded her heart to love the Lord.
