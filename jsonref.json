Poroshenko also did not keep to a pledge to end the war in the east within weeks.          People wait to get their ballots at a polling station, during the second round of presidential elections in Kiev.

Like his sitcom character, a teacher thrust into the presidency after a video of him blasting corruption goes viral, he has focused on fighting graft.The campaign was marked by fierce mutual criticism and a jockeying for dominance, wrapping up with Friday\u0027s debate at the nation\u0027s largest sports arena in which the rivals both fell on their knees in a melodramatic moment to ask forgiveness of those who lost relatives on the eastern battlefront.       A woman holds her ballot before voting at a polling station, during the second round of presidential elections in Kiev, Ukraine, SundayJust a few hours before polls opened, a court in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev heard a suit filed by a Zelenskiy foe who claimed that the actor tried to bribe voters when his campaign offered tickets to the debate and demanded that his registration be annulled. The court rejected the demand early Sunday.Poroshenko, a billionaire candy magnate before taking office, has relied on traditional political barnstorming, using sympathetic television stations to give extensive coverage of his appearances. Zelenskiy, however, has largely stayed away from the campaign trail and eschewed interviews. On Saturday, Poroshenko made a last-ditch plea to voters, begging Ukrainians to think twice before backing his rival.\u0027A five-year presidential term is not a comedy that you can easily switch off if it is no longer funny,\u0027 he said on Facebook. Neither is it a horror movie that can be easily stopped.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Australian woman reveals moment held dying two month old baby arms AirAsia flight","story":"Share this article \u0027I was screaming we need a doctor, we need a doctor and about 20 people came running,\u0027 she told ABC News.   Doctors performed CPR on the baby as her distraught parents watched on in horror. Ms Parenzee asked the pilot about making an emergency landing and was given the option of Jakarta and Perth. The plane then headed to Perth in the hopes of being able to get instant medical assistance.Doctors continued working on the baby, attempting to resuscitate her for the next two-and-a-half hours as they reached Perth. Medical staff took over on the tarmac but was unable to be saved.          Soon after, Farah went limp and Ms Parenzee (pictured) yelled out for doctors to help her          \u0027My heart is numb and I don\u0027t know how to feel but I am honestly honoured to have held her and read a prayer on her before she passed,\u0027 she wrote\u0027My heart is numb and I don\u0027t know how to feel but I am honestly honoured to have held her and read a prayer on her before she passed,\u0027 she wrote. She praised the staff on board the Air Asia flight, \u0027you were amazing and I commend your professionalism.\u0027 An AirAsia spokesman confirmed the plane was met by police and paramedics when it landed following a \u0027medical emergency\u0027.\u0027The safety and well-being of our guests is always our number one priority, and in accordance with procedure, the flight crew requested medical assistance on landing,\u0027 he said.\u0027Our thoughts are with the infant and family involved.\u0027Police say the infant\u0027s death is not suspicious but a report will be prepared for the coroner.The same aircraft, which was scheduled to return to Kuala Lumpur at 6.50am, was delayed by four hours as a result of the death.          Forensic officers are seen removing evidence from the Air Asia flight where Farah died AirAsia passenger tells how baby died in her arms on flight from Kuala Lumpur to Perth - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)"},{"url":null,"title":"School run jams roads term time road users face extra 16 minutes journey","story":"Share this article Commuters in the north-west of the country benefit the most from school holidays with their average commute time dropping from 41 minutes to 25. Nearly half of those surveyed said they were late to work due to traffic at least once a month. London was the most congested city in the UK with drivers losing an average of 227 hours thanks to traffic.           A new study by car insurer Admiral revealed that 80 per cent of parents driving their children to school could use alternative methods of transportLondon was ranked the sixth most congested city in the world, behind Moscow, Istanbul, Bogota, Mexico City and Sao Paulo.  Commenting on the findings, Sabine Williams, head of Motor at Admiral, said: \u0027Our investigation has laid bare the impact of the school run on the morning commute, with proof that dropping children at school or nursery is affecting all commuters, both those with and without children.\u0027 Steve Brooks, Wales\u0027 Director of UK sustainable transport charity, Sustrans, said: \u0027It\u0027s not surprising that research has found there are less traffic collisions during school holidays. \u0027Currently, roads outside schools are overcrowded and congested.

Although the London Cart Horse Parade was traditionally held on Whit Monday, the day after the Christian celebration of Pentecost, it moved to Easter Monday when it joined with the London Van Horse Parade         The objective of the original parades was to improve the conditions cart horses were subjected to. Over-worked, underfed and mistreated, many horses were living harsh lives as they worked on the streets of London. The parades aimed to show owners and the public how magnificent these horses were to improve human interest in their welfare         Despite carts no longer being used on the streets of London, except for Fullers Brewery and funeral horses, many horses are kept with modern carts fit with leather seating and metal footrests. A young boy enjoys a ride in the plush leather seat at the front of this modern cart as it is pulled in to position at the parade         The first London Cart Horse Parade was held in Battersea Park where 102 carts were entered.

The same year the limit was lifted due to falling numbers 1,259 animals joined the tenth London Van Horse Parade         A pony is dressed up with red bows in its mane as it makes it way to the parade route.

I love listening to her, pretending her teddies and dolls are competing in the Olympics, or that they’re all working in a cotton mill — she loves history and learning about monarchies from around the world.Now six, she’s in year two at Catholic primary school, a year ahead of where she should be.Most important, she’s got lots of friends and is a happy, sociable and kind little girl who loves helping others and just happens to be academically gifted.  Other people think I\u0027m a pushy parent          Alannah has an IQ of 140 and in February became the second-youngest member of MensaNadine George, 37, is a part- time business analyst. Husband Edmund, 39, is a management consultant, and they have two children Alannah, four, and Ethan, two. The family lives in Buckinghamshire. Alannah has an IQ of 140 and in February became the second-youngest member of Mensa. Nadine says:Alannah lives and breathes sums and letters and would rather watch Endless Numbers, a children’s educational series, on YouTube than Peppa Pig.She could recite the alphabet at 18 months old and by her second birthday she had taught herself to read. At first, I just assumed she’d got an outstanding memory or was simply ahead for her age.However, I started to monitor her milestones more closely — the average ages at which children learn basic sums, counting, and reading — and realised the gaps between her and her peers was widening.So in January, we had her assessed by top educational psychologist Dr Peter Congdon.He used the Wechsler Preschool And Primary Scale Of Intelligence, which involves several tests including spelling, mental arithmetic and puzzles, spread over two hours.He concluded that Alannah is ‘intellectually gifted and of superior general intelligence’ with an IQ of 140.         Four-year-old Alannah George, the youngest member of Mensa, is pictured with her mother Nadine, father Edmond and little brother Ethan Of course it made us proud, but most important, it’s helped us to understand how Alannah ticks.We know her strengths — such as arithmetic — and areas we need to play closer attention to, for example keeping her inquisitive mind challenged.Learning is her idea of fun and she loves her school, St George’s School at Windsor Castle, once attended by Princess Eugenie and Prince Edward’s two children. The teachers are very good at adjusting her learning to keep her challenged and engaged.There are downsides to having such a bright child. Some people assume we’re pushy parents and others accuse me of bragging. But you can’t teach an IQ — it reflects learning capacity and potential, not achievement.In fact, my parenting style is very laid back and one reason I’m speaking out is to help other mums who recognise traits of a high IQ in their own children because it’s a real worry when you don’t know where to turn.My husband and I are academic — I have a chemistry degree from Imperial College, London, and he has a PhD in biochemical engineering from UCL — but we weren’t sure how to best help Alannah, which is where Mensa comes in.When Alannah’s not reading or doing sums, she’s a regular four-year-old girl and her friends don’t see her as being any different."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3868488.1555956674!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"buddy benches aimed at making school playtime less lonely","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJackson Cooney (8) and Daniel Murray (8) pictured on the schoolyard buddy bench at Castlemartyr National School in Co Cork. Photograph: Daragh McSweeneyProvisionWhen Treacy Cooney was chatting with her eight-year-old son recently, he announced he was feeling sad. Other children at his school were playing in their own groups and he felt left out.Cooney remembered hearing about an idea called a “buddy bench” and approached the organisation and her son’s primary school, Castlemartyr National School in east Cork.The idea is if a child is worried about feeling left out or excluded, they can sit on the bench. When another child sees them, they can involve them in their games.Jane Flannery, the school principal, says the idea works particularly well for children aged six to nine.“It’s great for promoting friendship and empathy,” she says. “It’s about cultivating the idea of seeing things from another person’s point of view. The more we can deliver that message, the better.”In a sense, the buddy bench is more than just a simple piece of furniture. It is part of a wider programme aimed at boosting empathy and self-awareness among children, as well as giving children the tools to combat bullying and promote positive mental health.Interactive workshopsBuddy Bench, the Kilkenny-based group behind the programme, is delivering interactive workshops with children in schools where benches are being installed. There are role-plays, puppets and children learn songs that encourage them to look out for each other.“The children explore the clues other children give away on the outside about how they feel on the inside,” says Sam Sheppard, a parent and co-founder of Buddy Bench.The response to the initiative has been overwhelming, she says. It has provided workshops and benches in more than 300 schools on the island of Ireland, reaching up to 50,000 children.As well as helping children recognise other people’s feelings, the programme also helps teach children to recognise and respond to their own feelings.The idea, says Sheppard, is that if you can identify your feelings, you can respond to them in a more appropriate way.“Children can feel how positive qualities such as kindness and compassion feel in their bodies,” she says.“We explore what exclusion feels like in our bodies – lonely, scared, unworthy, sad. And then we talk about how inclusion makes us feel accepted, warm, safe, valued. We teach kids to notice how others are feeling on the inside by the clues they give on the outside.”Online bullyingThe programmes, says Sheppard, have been adjusted to suit children’s ages. They have also been changed over time to keep up with developments.For example, online bullying has become a major theme, especially for older children, as well as issues such as anxiety and dealing with panic attacks.While the programme is well-meaning, is there any evidence that it is working in boosting children’s capacity to deal with adversity?Sheppard says researchers at Maynooth University have been assessing the programme and are in the middle of a major two-year evaluation.An initial study found that about 40 per of children questioned were using the benches, while 90 per cent said if they saw someone else sitting on them they would talk to them.“Everything has to be evidence-based nowadays,” says Sheppard.”We see ourselves as Ireland’s first evidence-based positive mental health initiative for children.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3868383.1555968966!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government signals move to end two tier public service pay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers from several unions protest in 2018. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The Government has signalled that it will move to end the two-tier pay system in the public service as part of future negotiations with trade unions.Two initiatives have been tabled to deal with the lower-pay arrangements for staff hired after 2011, including a phased €200 million proposal announced last September to resolve the issue by 2026.However, unions maintained that some State employees, particularly teachers, would still be left significantly worse off than their longer-serving colleagues.In a statement agreed with public sector unions on Monday, the Government acknowledged that “outstanding issues of concern” will now be given full consideration in either an upcoming pay review or in the context of the new round of pay talks.No date was announced for the start of new talks on addressing the matter. The current public service pay agreement is scheduled to run until the end of next year with negotiations on a subsequent accord likely to commence in about a year’s time.The Government has never before indicated publicly there could be any form of other “pay review mechanism” as suggested in the statement.The  has reported\u0026nbspthat the acting secretary of the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Kevin Callinan, had indicated that it would seek a mid-term review of the current pay accord in the wake of the Government’s proposed settlement with nurses after their recent strike.The two-tier pay systems date\u0026nbspback to measures put in place to tackle the collapse of the public finances a decade ago. The then government reduced pay rates for new entrants across the public service by 10 per cent while allowances were also scrapped. The move particularly affects teachers as they continued to be employed in the public service while a recruitment moratorium was in place almost everywhere else.While the Government has since narrowed the gap in a number of pay deals, unions argue that new entrant teachers still face future losses of up to €19,000.The statement represents a shift in policy by the Government, which up to now has insisted that the two-tier pay issue has been fully addressed. The wording was agreed between public sector unions and the department on the eve of teachers’ annual conferences.Sheila Nunan, outgoing general secretary of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO), informed delegates at its annual congress in Galway yesterday that a process had been agreed with government, “finally setting a pathway towards ending pay inequality”.John Boyle, who is due to replace Ms Nunan, said it was a move to finally get the two-tier pay issue “over the finishing line”.A government report published last year estimated that 60,000 personnel across the public service were affected by the lower pay rates introduced for those taken on after 2011.This included more than 16,000 teachers, nearly 5,000 special needs assistants and almost 10,000 nurses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3867740.1555876169!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bug that causes relapsing fever identified in tick collected in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSE estimates there are 100 to 200 cases of Lyme disease a year in Ireland but patient groups and some doctors say this is too lowA bug that causes a rare form of relapsing fever has been identified in a tick collected in Ireland for the first time.The bug, a strain of Borrelia bacteria, was identified in a tick collected in Portumna, Co Galway.The Borrelia miyamotoi pathogen, first identified in ticks from Japan in 1995, is distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The initial symptom of the illness is usually a red skin rash but if left untreated, further symptoms can follow including a fever, muscle pain, joint swelling and temporary paralysis of the facial muscles.The find is reported in a study published in the Plos One scientific journal by a team of Irish scientists, including researchers from University College Dublin and University College Cork.They say their research shows ticks in Ireland are infected by a ersity of disease-carrying Borrelia bacteria. The results also show Borrelia-infected ticks exist in the southeast, an area hitherto not considered to be significantly tick-infested and hence not considered an area of risk to humans from Lyme disease.Infected ticksFive per cent of ticks collected for the study were found to be carrying infectious Borrelia, with rates varying from 2 per cent in Killarney, Co Kerry, to 12 per cent in Portumna. All of the sampling sites, which also included Glenveagh, Co Donegal, Glendalough, Co Wicklow and Clifden, Co Galway, collected ticks infected with some form of Borrelia.The HSE estimates there are about 100 to 200 cases of Lyme disease a year but patient groups and some doctors say this is too low. The new study appears to indicate some ticks could be transmitting another disease, which has similar symptoms to Lyme disease.“It is likely if ticks have relapsing fever Borrelia, they are biting humans, and maybe we are ‘missing’ patients because no one is aware of relapsing fever in Ireland, and the current test does not pick up anyone with relapsing fever borreliosis,” said Prof Jack Lambert, one of the authors of the study.High feverTick-borne relapsing fever is characterised by a high fever that lasts for a few days, goes away for a week, and then comes back. Though rare, the disease is found in western states of the US and in parts of Spain.The disease normally goes away of itself, but severe cases are treated with antibiotics.Health authorities say the best way to prevent infection from a tick bite is to take precautions when outdoors, such as wearing long trousers and tucking trouser legs into socks, and using tick repellents."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Department, unions issue statement suggesting review mechanism may be agreedNorthern Ireland records warmest ever Easter at 21.4 degrees in ArmaghFire crews, assisted by locals, battled blaze which scorched hundreds of acres of landDeal will see outstanding concerns addressed as part of any new pay review mechanismJournalist\u0026rsquos friends stamp red handprints on dissident republican Derry offices in protestINTO calls for cap of 20 pupils per class to ensure children reach their full potentialMembers of Republican Sinn F\u0026eacutein, 32 County Sovereignty groups marched through DublinThe funeral of Bridget Ward will take place on ThursdayUnion says graduates are rejecting profession, leaving teaching gaps in key subjectsFirefighters faced a mile long firefront as caravan park and homes evacuatedMore than 100 participate in dissident republican Easter Rising commemoration in BelfastStaff thought customer, who has a limp due to his condition, was inebriatedCourt heard injured party had carotid artery severed during an allegedly pre-arranged fightSolicitor says Keith McClenaghan (39) is sorry for disruption caused by his actionsGarda\u0026iacute investigating both incidents but no injuries have been reportedPovlsen (46) is Denmark\u0026rsquos wealthiest man and allegedly the largest landowner in ScotlandAthlete urges Irish people to treat those in direct provision with the respect he has always been shownParenting: How you can help your child choose the right subjects for themCofI\u0026rsquos Michael Jackson says public interest needs to give voice to things beyond number crunchingThe most influential Catholic prelate in Ireland has one year left as a bishop - has he any regrets?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3868406.1555951778!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more marches by dissident organisations on o connell street","story":"Members of Republican Sinn Féin have assembled in Dublin city centre to commemorate the Easter rising.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe Another march by dissident republicans, some of them wearing paramilitary style attire, took place on Dublin’s O’Connell Street on Monday to mark the 1916 rising.Just before 2pm about 55 members of Republican Sinn Féin, which has links to the Continuity IRA, marched from the Garden of Remembrance to the GPO where the proclamation was read aloud.Earlier on Monday about 100 members of the 32 County Sovereignty movement, an anti-Good Friday agreement organisation with links to the Real IRA, did the same.The marches come four days after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry by a suspected member of another dissident group, the New IRA.On Saturday another march on O’Connell Street by Saoradh, which is associated with the New IRA, was widely condemned.There was a significant garda presence during both marches on Monday. Uniformed gardaí walked behind and beside the parade while plain clothes members of the Special Detective Unit (SDU) mingled in the crowd, occasionally asking people questions.Men in unmarked cars with tinted windows, presumed to be members of the SDU or National Surveillance Unit, watched attendees as they gathered at the Garden of Remembrance.As members of Republican Sinn Féin walked to the GPO, led by a colour guard of men wearing green jumpers, combat boots and berets, one bystander asked them “do you want peace?”Some marchers flashed peace signs while others told the man to “f**k off”. Other bystanders then congratulated the questioner.Outside the GPO a Republican Sinn Féin member read the 1916 Proclamation before another man gave a speech warning of infiltration of the group by people who wish to damage it an complaining about the “misuse of the honourable name of Sinn Féin” by other groups.He said was difficult to attract new members to the group “because republicanism has been denigrated” and “we have to contend with the media.”The Irish State is “a corrupt rotten illegal State” which “has to be taken apart”, he said to small amount of applause.There was no mention of the murder of Ms McKee.Both events passed off peacefully. It is understood neither group had made the Garda or Dublin City Council aware of the planned marches."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3867554.1555862300!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd how the egomaniac in the oval was exonerated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Donald Trump: While he  was a whirl of ignorance, vindictiveness and self-destruction, some advisers stopped him from going over the edge by ignoring his “crazy shit”. Photograph: Kevin LamarqueWhen it comes to presidential obstruction, at least Watergate started with a crime. A stupid crime, but a crime.After 675 days, more than 2,800 subpoenas, nearly 500 search warrants, $30 million spent, endless jaw-jaw on cable and countless whiny Trump tweets, we have come down to one fundamental truth.And it’s the same truth that has been terrorising us all along: Donald Trump’s dirtbag machinations are driven by insane vanity.The First Narcissist’s all-consuming blend of braggadocio and insecurity has turned Washington and its rickety institutions into a dystopian outpost of his id.President Trump obstructed on nearly every page of Volume II of the Mueller report, even though Robert Mueller was too lost in legalese to throw the book at him. The report counts as the Worst Exoneration Ever, replete with incrimination.And Trump’s motivation for trying to subvert justice and turn the White House into a writhing nest of liars? His ego.He did not want people to think that the Russians were responsible for his election and that he was an illegitimate president.And why was this the burr under his sociopathic saddle? Obviously, because he thinks he is an illegitimate president. He never expected to win.The idea that he is in the Oval Office under false pretences plays into his twisted sense of victimhood. The spoiled scion of Fifth Avenue somehow always finds a way to be aggrieved, a victim of the media, the deep state, “dirty cops”, note-taking aides and the elites – all out to get him.Puerile citationsIt’s the same reason he is still talking at rallies about that “beautiful map” of his electoral college victory, with its large swaths of red. And the same reason he focuses on ratings and crowd sizes and subscription numbers and all the other puerile citations of his ego arithmetic.We can’t know for sure if there is a more sinister reason for Trump’s obstruction because Mueller didn’t put him under the interrogation lights. The special counsel did not provide any insight into whether Vladimir Putin has something on him.All we know for now is that Trump’s advisers, talking under oath to federal prosecutors, attributed his actions to his fear of being seen as illegitimate.“Several advisers recalled that the president-elect viewed stories about his Russian connections, the Russia investigations and the intelligence community assessment of Russian interference as a threat to the legitimacy of his electoral victory,” noted Volume II (which makes for far superior reading to Volume I).Hope Hicks, the former Trump communications director, told investigators that Trump considered the assessment his “Achilles’ heel” because if people thought Russia helped him win, it would take away from his own accomplishment. Sean Spicer, Rick Gates and Reince Priebus echoed this point.In other words, “boss man,” as Hicks called him, would be that most dreaded thing, the thing his father taught him to scorn, a loser, and he would be the thing he falsely accused Barack Obama of – illegitimate.Whirl of ignoranceDespite the American carnage shown in the report, Republicans were mostly staring uncomfortably at their wingtips. Angry Democrats, if they had their way, would put Trump protector William Barr in the dock, right beside Trump.The closest we get to a hero in the sordid report – as opposed to Kenneth Starr’s lurid report – is the former White House counsel Don McGahn.While Trump was a whirl of ignorance, vindictiveness and self-destruction, some advisers stopped him from going over the edge by ignoring his “crazy shit” as McGahn called it. When Trump complained that McGahn was taking notes, unlike Roy Cohn, McGahn explained that “real” lawyers take notes.The president called McGahn at home twice on June 17th, 2017 – which happened to be the 45th anniversary of the Watergate burglary – to order injustice at the justice department by telling Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller. Trump was using a lame pretext of a conflict of interest involving the Trump golf club in Virginia where Mueller had once been a member.“McGahn recalled the president telling him ‘Mueller has to go’ and ‘Call me back when you do it,’” the report stated.The White House counsel knew to hit the brakes and shelve Trump’s demand. As the report noted: “McGahn was concerned about having any role in asking the acting attorney general to fire the special counsel because he had grown up in the Reagan era and wanted to be more like Judge Robert Bork and not ‘Saturday Night Massacre Bork.’”The thuggish Don in the White House obviously regards McGahn as his Sammy the Bull rat, calling him a “lying bastard”. On Friday, the president tweeted, not so cryptically: “Watch out for people that take so-called ‘notes’ when the notes never existed until needed,” and later tweeted that it was “finally time to turn the tables” on some of those who have crossed him.Of course, McGahn, the shaggy-haired libertarian who plays guitar in an 1980s cover band, needed to put up with the volatile president long enough to fulfil his own agenda: cementing the conservative majority on the Supreme Court and salting lower federal courts with hard-right conservatives who are going to be around for decades.McGahn did Trump two huge favours. He kept him from firing Mueller, which would have put a nail in the presidential coffin. And he delivered Trump’s greatest triumph on the right, conspiring with Mitch McConnell to fill the courts with socially conservative judges intent on undoing government regulation.Ironically, Trump’s most lasting legacy was engineered by the same guy who shivved the president hardest in the Mueller report. – New York TimesRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"notre dame ablaze pictures","story":"A huge fire has consumed Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.Officials in Paris said the fire, which started around 7pm local time, could be linked to renovation works being carried out at the cathedral. French media reports, citing police sources, added that the fire started by accident. Who was behind the Sri Lanka bombings?

The nine faces of baby weaningAlice Fotheringham, an infant nutritional expert at Piccolo, said: “Naturally most parents hate seeing their child distressed so there is a tendency to give up on a new food if your baby pulls what you might perceive to be an unhappy face.“However, it can take up to 12 tries for a baby to get used to a new food, so understanding how to read little faces can be useful in helping you persevere, especially if you want to ensure you’re giving your little one plenty of varied foods and all the right nutrients.”Previous research has indicated that British parents are more impatient and persevere less than others in Europe when it comes to introducing new foods to their babies.A survey from the European Toddler Nutrition Index in 2013 found 26 per cent of children under five in the UK were allowed to refuse a meals at least once a day compared to 15 per cent in France and Germany.Goldsmiths, University of LondonWho was behind the Sri Lanka bombings?

What should I do with it?\u0027And I\u0027m screaming \u0027destroy\u0027 and they get advised to go and plant it in their garden.”Prof Spence also warned against buying plants from overseas online.She said: Just because it\u0027s available on Amazon doesn\u0027t necessarily mean it\u0027s actually legal and we are constantly working with Amazon and eBay to track down material that is not compliant.Last year, a Gardeners\u0027 World feature on olive trees said that they were ideal to help create the perfect Mediterranean Garden, but Prof Spence branded the advice “irresponsible” noting that they had been banned from Chelsea Flower Show amid fears Xylella.The disease has ravaged Italy\u0027s olive groves and could decimate UK trees including the oak, elm and sycamore.More than 350 different plants are vulnerable to Xylella, including lavender, rosemary and flowering cherry.But foreign plants can also being other diseases to the British ecosystem. Ash dieback was first officially confirmed in the UK in 2012 when it was found in a consignment of infected trees imported from a nursery in the Netherlands.And fuchsia gall mite, which disfigures plants and is now rife in the South East, has been attributed to an enthusiast illegally importing cuttings from South America.Luke Barley, A National Trust ranger at work felling ash trees infected with dieback near Ilam in the Derbyshire Peak District.Recently, the Royal Horticultural Society\u0027s director general Sue Biggs warned holidaymakers off bringing foreign plants back to Britain.For many people, wandering the olive groves of Italy and lavender fields of France are as much a part of the holiday experience as the cities and beaches,” she said.But we\u0027re asking people to leave these beautiful plants where they are for future visitors to enjoy and not to bring them back home with them.This is vital if we are going to win the fight to protect our gardens against the growing threat of pests and diseases.The BBC said that both shows criticised by Prof Spence “Feature advice from horticultural experts and have contributed to the public\u0027s awareness of biosecurity by highlighting the importance of the issue - and will keep audiences updated with any developments which may impact gardeners in the UK.Please review our commenting policyWho was behind the Sri Lanka bombings?

I am passionate about looking into that, McClure said.I want to know what\u0027s being done on that side of things.The funding is the hardest part, to have the choir running all the time, they\u0027re not cheap. It\u0027s free to sing, but to have that routine and providing tea and coffee and somewhere to do it, it costs money.It can be cheap and manageable, but it\u0027s not free. (We) need the backing of councils and the Government.Vicky McClure in her day job on Line of DutyThe documentary follows the journey of 20 people with a form of dementia, aged between 31 and 87, from McClure\u0027s home town of Nottingham.The 35-year-old, who also starred in the This is England film and spin-off series, experienced dementia first-hand through caring for her grandmother Iris, who died in 2015.Asked if she\u0027s concerned about getting dementia, McClure said: What can I do about it?

You\u0027ve just got to live your life and enjoy every day.The episodes see the group training with choral director Mark De-Lisser, singing well-known hits like Build Me Up Buttercup by The Foundations and Stand By Me by Ben E. King.Although members of the choir see improvements during the documentary, McClure said the deterioration of members since filming is frightening.McClure said: There have of course been changes in people since we filmed.  Some are in homes now and they are all deteriorating, rapidly for some. It\u0027s quite frightening.I can tell when people recognise who I am and when they\u0027re just being polite.

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Numerous summary articles and ruinous posts are littered across the internet, and you might even come into contact with one without trying.That means that any fans should be advised to take proactive measures if they don\u0027t want to find out what happens in the film before it comes out at the end of the month.Thankfully there are a whole host of tools that can make it easier to ignore anyone trying to ruin 2019\u0027s biggest film for you.Created with Sketch. Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.With the potential to be the most frustrating of platforms – links can fly into your feed without you realising – it\u0027s helpful that Twitter offers built-in tools to make it easy to mute just about whatever you like.Every Avengers character ranked from worst to bestHead into the settings on desktop or mobile and find the Muted Words option. You can then add all the words you want, and they\u0027ll be banned from showing up on your Twitter, even if you then move to other devices.Last year, Facebook finally added the option to mute keywords, something that previously could only be done with fiddly extensions and a lot of work. The relatively new feature, called Keyword Snooze, is made for exactly this kind of situation.The unfortunate thing is that you\u0027ll have to wait until you see an Avengers: Endgame post before you can actually mute them, by which point you might already have fallen victim to the spoilers. If you do see something that includes keywords that you want to mute, you can click the option in the corner of the post, which will give you the option to snooze a selection of the words included in there for 30 days.Instagram doesn\u0027t let you mute specific words in your feed. Helpfully it\u0027s probably not all that likely that anyone will actually ruin a film through their posts, though of course it\u0027s always possible someone will post the leaked footage or some other annoying spoiler.It does however let you mute topics in the Explore tab, which might be useful, since they come from strangers and are so more likely to include surprises in them. Do that by long pressing on any of the topics that pop up there, which should let you mute that channel.Remember, too, that Instagram does have the option to mute\u0026nbsppeople, as well as topics. So if there\u0027s someone you\u0027re worried about spoiling it for you, you can head to their profile and select the mute option – either pre-emptively or in anger.It is possible to pick the nuclear option and, Thanos-like, remove the half of the internet that is threatening you with spoilers.\u0026nbspSearching through the extensions available for your browser should give you a whole host of options that will let you mute certain keywords, in a variety of different ways.Always be vigilant about doing so. First, you might miss important information if your keywords are chosen too widely: you\u0027re probably safe muting Avengers, but Endgame might get in the way a little more. And secondly, these extensions work by reading through the pages you\u0027re browsing on, so make sure they\u0027re made by someone dependable.Keyword muting and vigilance will only get you so far: the fact is, there are some people out there desperate to share spoilers, whatever the cost. And if they\u0026nbspare sufficiently clever about it, they are always going to be able to get around keyword filters, by using unexpected or very generic wording.The only foolproof way to avoid spoilers entirely is to leave the internet. But even then you are faced with the possibility that someone might mention something in person, or that you\u0027ll accidentally stumble into an annoying billboard or magazine cover...As such, avoiding spoilers entirely and without any risk at all might be impossible. It is probably best just to take the advice above and adopt a mindful approach towards anyone who does happen tor ruin everything for you.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When Danielle Atkins joined the company as vice president\u0026nbspand global chief brand officer\u0026nbspin 2014, the business was just emerging from bankruptcy, struggling to keep up with new trends and no longer resonating with younger audiences.Four years later,\u0026nbspKodak is not completely out of the woods.\u0026nbspBut it’s already doing better, with a growing brand licensing business worth $3m\u0026nbsp(£2.3m) and a consumer ision which brought $48m (£36.5m) in revenue during the third quarter of last year. Atkins was arguably one of the biggest players behind the brand’s revival. Throughout her career, she was never one to shy away from a challenge.“When I left my position as a marketing director at Beats\u0026nbspBy Dre, my 17-year-old son asked\u0026nbspme, ‘Why would you leave Beats for Kodak? What is Kodak?’” she tells The Independent.A View from the Top with Greg Jackson, CEO of green energy Octopus“But for me, working for that brand, which in my mind was one of the greatest in the world, was a big exciting opportunity. Kodak had forgotten that they had a brand that people genuinely cared about.”Her passion for the\u0026nbspcompany started during her childhood in Penzance. John Adams, her father, was one of the pioneers of the west Cornwall surf scene in the 1960s and made Super 8mm films featuring local surfers, while her mother Sally was a stills photographer.“When my brother and I were young we used to travel around with my parents, while my father was showing his movies,” Atkins\u0026nbspsays.\u0026nbsp“At that time you couldn’t see surf movies in the cinema and there was no video or YouTube.\u0026nbsp“We had this incredibly bohemian lifestyle, where we were basically brought up on a beach. It was all about surfing, music and film.”After graduating with a degree in history of art and medieval archaeology from UCL, she got a job at Pres.co, one of the first digital agencies working on some of the earliest websites in the late 1990s.“We won Marks \u0026amp Spencer as a client, and I remember being in front of their board aged 21, presenting our first digital campaign – it was a really disruptive time. The big advertisement agencies were still very dominant so what we were doing was very innovative.”Moving quickly up the career ladder, Atkins\u0026nbspheld senior marketing positions at PwC, Nokia and Innovision, where she was responsible for dressing the city for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, including the notorious installation of the Olympic Rings on the Tower Bridge that she still refers to as one of the biggest highlights of her career.Looking for her next challenge, she quit her job as director of creative expression at Nokia in 2013\u0026nbspfor what was then a small start-up called Beats By Dre.“It was a huge job but that’s the point about going to startups,” Atkins says.\u0026nbsp“Beats only had about 70 to 80 people employees at the time and the volume of work we did was incredible.”Her energy and her collaborative approach saw massive growth in both the company’s sales and revenue. Notably, she led the team who made Beats the\u0026nbsp“most talked about brand” during the 2014 Brazil World Cup with\u0026nbsp“The Game Before The Game” campaign.Featuring footballers including Cesc Fabregas, Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge ​and Brazil’s\u0026nbspNeymar alongside non-sporting celebrities, the star-studded advert accumulated nearly 34 million views on YouTube.“It was a five-minute\u0026nbspvideo that we launched like a film and activated in every single city around the world,” Atkins says.\u0026nbsp“I was just 34-years-old at the time and working with a very young team. For us, it felt a huge job and it was thrilling every day.”But things changed quickly when Beats was acquired by Apple in 2014.“I enjoy working in a very fast-paced environment, which enables me to be entrepreneurial. This was very easy to do at Beats but much harder to do in a company like Apple.

By 2010, it is the seventh biggest2011: Kodak shares fall by more than 80 per cent, partly because the company struggles to meet pension costs for its2012 - Kodak files for chapter 11 bankruptcySix months after the acquisition, she was approached by Kodak and took a leap of faith leaving a thriving company for one barely emerging from bankruptcy. “What’s been amazing for me with this role is that I was able to make Kodak what I wanted,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I always wanted to do a job I was passionate about and being part of the turnaround team at Kodak meant I could really allow myself to be creative.”So how did she change the brand’s fortunes?With very limited budgets, Atkins set about identifying who the brand’s customers were and\u0026nbspcame to understand that its heart and core audience came from the creative fields.“When budgets are small, you have to be very creative for a start. You need to look at what you have and what you can work with.\u0026nbspWhat I had was a brand with an amazing history, heritage and a legacy of incredible branding and graphic design.”Part of the inspiration behind the redesign of the company was looking back at the heritage of the brand and weaving\u0026nbspthe vision of Kodak’s founder, George Eastman back into it.For this reason, the first thing Atkins did was to bring back a similar iteration of the Kodak K logo\u0026nbspintroduced in 1971. “I started spotting old Kodak logos everywhere around the world, so I wanted to revive and bring back the colour into the logo,” she explains.More than a hundred years earlier, Eastman had invented roll film, allowing photography to become a hobby of the masses.\u0026nbsp“You don’t buy a Kodak Carousel slide viewer, you buy yesterday” –\u0026nbspas Don Draper told Kodak’s executives at the end of Mad Men’s first season, in one of the TV show’s most poignant moments.\u0026nbsp“It’s a time machine.”Atkins says: “With an amazing heritage brand like Kodak, leveraging that nostalgic element is important, but if you want to build a future business you can’t just rest on solely on heritage.”But if Kodak was going to stage a comeback in consumers’ hearts, it needed today’s teenagers and influencers behind it. This was no small task.When Atkins joined, Kodak didn’t even have an Instagram account – “just another example of how the brand had lost its way”.\u0026nbspMy father always said you should nail your colour to the mast. If someone tells me I can’t do something I automatically want to tryFast-forward four years, and it now has a healthy\u0026nbsp400,000 followers, which Atkins describes as a community of creatives who\u0026nbspcare about the brand.In fact, the company is resurrecting one of Kodak’s most popular films, Ektachrome – a colour reversal, or transparency, film launched in 1946 and discontinued in 2013.Using her experience at Beats, Atkins also spearheaded a series of fashion collaborations with brands including\u0026nbspOpening Ceremony and\u0026nbspForever 21.The clothes for the latter were emblazoned with Kodak logos from the 1990s, harking back to when Kodak was the most recognisable photography brand.“One thing I learned at Beats, is that there’s never a better promotion than someone recognisable wearing your brand,” Atkins says.The\u0026nbspvogue for all things analogue has also paved for the company to launch Kodachrome, an art magazine coined as a “new journal for anyone who loves art, film, and analogue culture”. The latest cover story was on Spike Lee, just after the release of BlacKkKlansman, which was shot on film.Youngsters’\u0026nbsplove affair with modern nostalgia is also helping to fuel demand for instant print, one of Kodak’s biggest sectors.Atkins says: “Large numbers of still photographers and creative are turning their backs on digital technology in favour of film. There’s something romantic about the process.”The reward was perhaps changing her son Zachary’s mind about Kodak.“He now thinks what we’re doing is very cool and for me that is a sign we’re doing things right.”Atkins certainly has energy. This year, she is training for a running race that\u0026nbspwill take her from Los Angeles to Las Vegas – 340 miles across the hostile terrain of the Nevada desert. With her brother last year she finished a bike ride from Cornwall to Mont Saint Michel in France.A view from the top with Regina Borda, Pizza Hut managing directorA View from the Top with Mark CuddiganA View from the Top with Jo Malone, the ‘Queen of fragrance’Nadhim Zahawi: the CEO turned children’s minister Kodak shares double after launching its own cryptocurrency“My father always said you should nail your colour to the mast,” she adds.\u0026nbsp“If someone tells me I can’t do something I automatically want to try.”Atkins, also mother to Eli, 11, firmly believes that women shouldn’t choose between having a career and having a family.“I was scared about having children, the whole idea of being pregnant scared me,” she says.\u0026nbsp“But I now consider them my two biggest achievements in life. It never stopped me from doing what I wanted.“You just have to be organised and also set a good example to people in your team, especially if you’re in a leading position.“I have to force myself to take an hour a day that is just for me – and it’s usually sports related or just walking my dog.\u0026nbsp You need that time, otherwise your head is always crowded with things.”Atkins is now working on\u0026nbspa business plan with an entrepreneur for Kodak’s latest project in the beauty sector – another first for the brand.“There’s a connection between looking good on camera and the beauty industry,” she explains.\u0026nbsp“It’s one of the most exciting projects that we’ve got and it’s directly associated with Hollywood, film and glamour.\u0026nbsp“Even if we’ve never done it before, it seems to be like there’s a natural connection. It’s all about always having a genuine commitment to innovation and creativity.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Still, it was pretty cynical of the retailer to leave it until 3pm on the day before the extended Easter weekend to confirm\u0026nbspthe widely trailed departure.\u0026nbsp“Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future,” said the former Amazoner who must wish he’d never left the internet giant.\u0026nbspDebenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Debenhams falls into administrationMike Ashley calls for Debenhams bosses to take lie detector testsSure, being the ultimate boss holds a powerful pull even for executives with fancy jobs at prestigious companies. But Debenhams was on a sticky wicket when he joined and the warning signs should have been obvious enough to him.\u0026nbspTurning the business around was always going to be a tough ask, one made all the more difficult by the requirement to fend off Sports Direct kingpin Mike Ashley, who ultimately got Bucher booted off the board for his trouble.\u0026nbspBut we’re always being told people like him are rare talents with the ability to fly, run around the world at\u0026nbspsix million miles an hour, shoot lasers from their eyes\u0026nbspand turn retailing sows ears and into silk purses while they’re at it. That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term\u0026nbspit still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone.

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to adapt to rising competition from online competitors and a general decline of high street shopping.It has also been saddled with high costs from its large number of stores.Only the best news in your

Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black.

While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor.

Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.He added: A beautiful, true moment between a father and his son.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved.

The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable.

If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel. The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue – subject to any local disruption at Folkestone andor CalaisMotorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types.Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights will continue to operate between the UK and European Union.The network of flight links between Britain and eastern Europe could be affected by any reduction in the number of workers from those countries. Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply. If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel. The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue – subject to any local disruption at Folkestone andor CalaisMotorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types.Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights will continue to operate between the UK and European Union.The network of flight links between Britain and eastern Europe could be affected by any reduction in the number of workers from those countries. Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.But the bruised and bloodied British travel industry – and shrewd travellers – are looking with some anxiety nine days beyond that. If the UK does not participate in the election of MEPs, it must leave the EU on this date, with or without a deal.Given the disarray and bitter political battles that have characterised Brexit, there is a possibility that the UK will fall out without a deal on 1 June 2019 – again, for many families, midway through half-term. For example, guerrilla parliamentary tactics by Brexiteers could prevent the necessary legislation getting through.Renewing my passport for Brexit was futileAnyone who has the good fortune to be in an EU nation at the start of June can probably relax about the new passport rules that would take effect, rendering any UK travel document with less than six months’ validity ineligible the authorities are unlikely to seek out offending Brits. But the motoring and medical issues will be serious concerns for some.Many British travellers with pre-existing medical conditions take a rational decision to rely upon the European Health Insurance Card for treatment within the EU the alternative is high-priced travel insurance. After almost three years of trying to find a post-Brexit successor to the reciprocal healthcare agreement, the government is still merely “hopeful” that something will happen.Another date, 30 June, is the deadline for British holidaymakers who want to take their dog or cat (or, indeed, ferret) to the European Union after that 31 October departure date. With no certainty about the “pet passport” regime from November onwards, the government says: “To make sure your pet is able to travel from the UK to the EU after EU Exit in any scenario, you should contact your vet at least four months before travelling to get the latest advice.”Thus the unholy mess continues. If, however, you are optimistic that the UK will not leave without a deal, then there could be a Brexit idend: reluctance to commit by some travellers means lower demand, and hence prices, than would prevail during a summer of sanity.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeCreate a commenting name to join the debateIndependent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeReturn to videoWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Almost 1,000 pubs vanished from communities in Britain last year, as the industry was hit by intense cost pressures and business rate increases.A total of 914 pubs disappeared in 2018, according to real estate data company Altus Group’s annual review, set to be released this week.Around 76 pubs vanished each month during the year, although this represents a slowdown in decline from 2017.The total number of pubs in England and Wales, liable for business rates, was 41,536 on January 1 2019, representing a fall of 1,530 since a controversial revaluation came into force in April 2017.UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said: “Pubs are being hit with a myriad of cost pressures at a time of unprecedented political uncertainty and unstable consumer confidence.Created with Sketch.Great Pubs of London - In pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sir Ian McKellan in the front bar ofThe area behind the bar crammed with ithA cosy seating area in the frontThe stairwell, which dates from the earlyThe view towards the bar in theThe first floor dining area, The LambThe view from behind the centralThe view from behind the bar, TheThe pewter bar and historic 400-The stunning marble and mosaic vaultedThe main bar at The French House, Dean Street, Soho.The front bar area with a gildedThe view into a snug in the main barThe vaulted cellars, which were once partA view into the ground-level mainAn exterior view of The Grapes fromSir Ian McKellan in the front bar ofThe area behind the bar crammed with ithA cosy seating area in the frontThe stairwell, which dates from the earlyThe view towards the bar in theThe first floor dining area, The LambThe view from behind the centralThe view from behind the bar, TheThe pewter bar and historic 400-The stunning marble and mosaic vaultedThe main bar at The French House, Dean Street, Soho.The front bar area with a gildedThe view into a snug in the main barThe vaulted cellars, which were once partA view into the ground-level mainAn exterior view of The Grapes from“Unless positive action is taken by the Government to address crippling costs, more pubs will be forced out of business.”Earlier this month, the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) warned that business rate increases are forcing publicans to lay off staff, increase prices and hold off investment.A survey of 650 licensees by the pub campaign group found that three out of four believed the system was unfair to pubs.Camra chief executive Tom Stainer said: “Since the last business rates revaluation in 2017, it has been clear that the system simply isn’t working for publicans.”However, the rate at which pubs are vanishing, either through demolition or conversion for other uses such as homes or offices, eased significantly, according to the new data.In the seven years prior to the change in business rates, the number of pubs in the UK ed from 54,674 to 43,066.Wetherspoons bans dogs in all of its pubs across BritainIn 2017, 1,292 pubs disappeared from the high street – at a rate of more than 100 pubs each month.Alex Probyn, president of expert services at Altus Group, said: “The increase in the thresholds at which businesses, such as pubs, pay business rates coupled with the pubs discount during the last two financial years has helped ease the decline.“The new retail discount, which slashed rates bills by a third for high street firms with a rateable value less than £51,000 from April 1, will help independent licensees in small premises and hopefully will stem the decline even further.”England and WalesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other packages were also found at Heathrow Airport and London City Airport, with the police saying they were bombs. Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionIn contrast, food stores enjoyed a 3.3 per cent\u0026nbspannual rise while\u0026nbsptextile, clothing and footwear stores saw a 7.1 per cent\u0026nbspincrease.Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS, said: “March’s mild weather boosted sales, with food shops also recovering after a weak February”.The resilience of consumers in the face of Brexit uncertainty has been helped in part by high levels of employment. The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

St Sebastian’s posted pictures of destruction inside the church on its Facebook page, showing blood on pews and the floor and asking for help from the public.“It felt like there was an earthquake,” said Vijaya Kumar, a 36-year-old worshipper who was attending the Easter service at St Anthony’s Shrine in Kochchikade, just outside Colombo. “Everything shook and fell, I was lucky because I was near a door.

As special task force and forensic teams teemed the bloodied bombed sites, hotel staff of the Cinnamon Grand said a suicide bomber blew himself up in the hotel’s restaurant.Three hours later a seventh explosion hit a hotel in Dehiwala, Colombo, near the national zoo. At least four people died, according to police.An eighth blast was reported just moments afterwards at a housing complex in the suburb of Dematagoda in Colombo. Three police officers were killed while investigating a tip-off from neighbours. “The explosion came from the upper floor of the house,” said a witness.A 6ft pipe bomb was reportedly found near\u0026nbspColombo’s main airport, but safely disposed of.Sri Lanka’s defence minister confirmed 24 people had been arrested, while police said the death toll had soared overnight from 200 to 290.The government has acknowledged that it had “prior information” of planned attacks on churches involving a little-known local Islamist group but did not do enough about it, in an apparent intelligence blunder.A well-known TV chef and her daughter were the first named victims of the attack. Shantha Mayadunne and her daughter Nisanga had been staying at the Shangri-La hotel when it was targeted.Ms Mayadunne’s daughter shared a group photo on Facebook on the morning of the bombings, with the caption: “Easter breakfast with family.” According to her Facebook page, Nisanga had studied at the University of London.At least five Britons were also confirmed dead by the country’s ministry of foreign affairs. Three were from the UK and two held dual US and UK citizenship.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo confirmed that “several” American citizens were among those killed in a statement condemning the attacks. “These vile attacks are a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat terrorism,” he added.Three people from India were also killed, along with one from Portugal, and two from Turkey. A Dutch national and a Chinese national were also reported as among the victims.The British high commissioner to Sri Lanka, James Dauris, visited British victims in hospital yesterday. Mr Dauris, who was at a church service with his family in Colombo when it was cut short by the attacks, said: “I’ve been speaking this afternoon with Brits in hospital who have been affected by today’s senseless attacks.“My team’s and my thoughts go out to all those people who are suffering as a result of the deplorable violence Sri Lanka has witnessed this Easter Sunday.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This letter to the people of the UK was written in a police cell, where I was held for six hours.The information is from my memory, having spent the past  years following climate science. I have never been an activist, nor have I been arrested before.I came to London to join the Extinction Rebellion and was camping at Marble Arch and protesting at multiple London sites until my arrest on Wednesday afternoon.The Extinction Rebellion aims are: For the Government to tell the truth about climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by  and to form a Citizens Assembly to determine how we achieve this.Preventing climate catastrophe is the most important political, social, environmental and technical problem humanity has ever faced.The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Changeis the United Nations body which assesses all available science related to climate change. It suggests a number of routes to limiting the rise in global average temperatures to .C. It also tells us that an increase of C will have much worse effects.All pathways to a maximum .C rise require cuts of around  per cent in global emissions within about  years. To have any chance of achieving this, we need to take immediate action to drastically reduce emissions.So far we have caused global average temperatures to increase by .C since the end of the s. We are already seeing the spread of wildfires, hurricanes, drought, melting icecaps, sea levels rising, ocean acidication, coral reef die-off and the largest scale extinction of animal and plant species since the end of the dinosaurs.The IPCC is predicting C to C of warming based on our current trajectory. With these changes, the Earth will not look like the one we recognise today, but rather like the planet of million years ago. Then there was no ice, temperatures were inhospitable and sea levels much higher — dferences that would totally destabilise ecosystems and society.As climate change continues, human-induced effects are amplied by earth processes, such as methane from melting permafrost and reduced reflection of light back in to space as polar ice sheets shrink. These processes will make global heating worse and are sometimes called tipping points, as they can lead to runaway climate change where the human effects are no longer the main drivers — and they are impossible to halt.Since human climate change was first predicted by Swedish physicist Arrhenius in , thousands of scientists, working for decades in dozens of countries and disciplines, have come to a consensus that climate change is real and the effects catastrophic. There is no scientic debate to be had.The Government is complacent about the UK’s emission reductions, while failing to meet its own targets.Given the situation, I feel the Extinction Rebellion is our last best shot at getting governments to listen and start telling the truth.Once the truth is being told I believe that YOU will be urging the Government to act fast and vote accordingly.My involvement in the rebellion and my arrest are my heartfelt attempt to do whatever I can to help prevent the worst effects of climate change and the social, environmental and financial costs it will cause.I am sorry for the disruption caused to local businesses and commuters.I also apologise to the politan Police for the ersion of resources. My experience of the Met is that there has been an atmosphere of mutual respect between them and protesters.I ask that you, the people, become properly informed about climate change. I also ask that Government, businesses and public bodies start taking transformative action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero.Finally, I ask for a Citizens Assembly, a representative group of the population which will determine the direction we take to get to zero carbon and will take decisions out of the electoral cycle and political and financial influence.The protesters in London represent a broad church of opinion but I would say my opinions and background are typical.If you have read this far, thank you very much.PIERS writes his letter from a police cell – and for that reason, I cannot take him seriously. He and his fellow protesters might think their cause is noble, but breaking the law is not.Equality before the law is one of the most important principles of British justice. The expectation has always been thatyou commit a crime, you will do the time.Yet for days now, parts of central London have been overrun by a rag-tag band of climate change activists, Piers among them.Setting up makesht camps at Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, members of Extinction Rebellion have blockaded roads. And they appeared to be doing so with the support of the politan Police and the force’s boss, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.Their cause is an important one, but like every good hostage taker, Extinction Rebellion has come armed with a list of demands, and protesters are prepared to be arrested to secure them. Yet even Extinction Rebellion must have been surprised the blockades were not removed for four days.Hundreds of thousands of Londoners have been suffering on a daily basis. Commuters cannot get to work as buses have been erted. Shoppers have had to abandon some of the busiest streets. Businesses can’t get essential supplies. Emergency vehicles are unable to take the quickest routes. The blockades have cost London millions.Nobody denies the activists are committing a crime by obstructing the streets. Until yesterday, police could be found helping them by acting as picket-line cheerleaders and traffic controllers. We have been told the police presence hasn’t detracted from usual police business. Which of us believes that Excusing their behaviour because it is an important and righteous cause ignores the problem that we are setting a precedent.The liberal, metropolitan elite cheering on the protesters should be careful what they wish for. Paris has been convulsed by violent protests that began in a similar way. Failure to apply the law of obstruction when the Yellow Vest movement started has cost France dear.Others with cause to be angry about politics will have learned the lessons from Extinction Rebellion’s successful action.Remain-backing Londoners may feel very dferently about the taking over of public spaceLeave supporters annoyed at the failure to secure Brexit hit the streets in peaceful protest. But they will have only themselves to blame. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet it is now leading in the UK polls for the European elections and is favourite to win them.Its meteoric rise is testament to both public anger at the delays to Britain leaving the European Union and to Nigel ­Farage’s skill as a campaigner.But would the Brexit Party winning the European Parliament elections actually change anything There are three ways in which it would have an impact.First, it will make some MPs more wary of a second referendum. Support for this has grown in Parliament in recent months, in part because more MPs have become confident that Remain would come out on top.Butthe Brexit Party wins the European elections, it will show that another referendum would be anything but a cakewalk for Remain. This might make some of these MPs more inclined to compromise.One group whom a Farage victory won’t make more inclined to compromise are the Brexiteer holdouts against May’s deal. They’ll argue that his ­success proves that the public supports No Deal.But I suspect that what it would show more than anything  is voters’ frustration that Brexit hasn’t happened yet.It is the delay — that these MPs must take their share of the blame for — which is so infuriating the public.Success for the Brexit Party will come at the expense of the Tories more than any other party.Debate will quickly sht to how the Tories can win these voters back, and that will boost the chances of the ­Brexiteer leadership contenders. Indeed, theof Farage has already led to ToryMPs taking a second look at Boris Johnson. The other great question is, what effect will a win for the Brexit Party have on Labour The cross-party Brexit talks will resume next week, but those close to them hold out little hope of success.The sense is that they will, in the words of one source, “drag on for a while” but it is “unlikely they will reach agreement”.Butthe Brexit Party is ­taking votes from Labour in its traditional heartlands, it will strengthen the hand of those in the party who just want to get a Brexit deal done so the issue is off the stocks before the next election.Some in government admit that this is unlikely to happen, as doing a deal with Theresa May on Brexit would cause bitter isions in Labour’s ranks.They do hold out hope, though, that it might lead to more Labour MPs being ­prepared to back the deal — a mere five Labour MPs voted for the withdrawal agreement last month.But with the DUP and hardcore Brexiteers determined not to back the deal, it would require  or more Labour MPs to come over — which is a hard ask — for the deal to pass.Perhaps the most signicant consequence of a Brexit Party triumph is that it would finish off Farage’s old party, Ukip.Ukip’s flirtation with Tommy Robinson street thuggery and YouTube stars who make light of rape has been a disaster for the party.The electorate will simply have no truck with such extremist nonsense and so Ukip won’t be the beneficiaries of the public’s anger at the Brexit delays.IF any government needed a reboot, it is this one. But the problem for Theresa May is that doing that requires a Queen’s Speech, and that could bring down her government.Ministers worry that any Queen’s Speech would have to include within it the Brexit deal. After all, that would be the biggest piece of ­legislation going through Parliament in the ­coming session.Butit did, the Queen’s Speech may well be voted down. Labour and Tory Brexit rebels could get together to defeat the Government.As one source at the heart of government points out: “If you haven’t got the votes for the deal, why would you have the votes to pass the Queen’s Speech ”A Queen’s Speech would also require the ­Government to do another deal with the DUP – the current agreement only lasts for this session of Parliament.Given the way the two party leaderships have fallen out over Brexit, this won’t be easy.One ­Cabinet minister tells me that the Tory DUP ­relationship needs “completely resetting” and that it will be a “pretty fraught negotiation”. Butthe Government doesn’t do a Queen’s Speech, it will become embarrassingly obvious that it is in office but NOT IN POWER.The Commons won’t have any government ­legislation to discuss. Rather, it will have to fill its time with pointless general debates.As one ­secretary of state frets: “What legislation do we have to keep bringing forward ”The Tories need to show that despite the Brexit impasse, they do have ideas on domestic ­policy – and that is going to require a Queen’s Speech.DON’T hold your breath for any Tory leadership dream tickets.A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that any contest is now six months away and therefore don’t want to commit to backing a candidate now.One minister close to the efforts to broker a dream ticket tells me: “Everything could look very dferent in October, so what’s the point in ­signing up now ”So all those ­waiting to seeAmber Rudd teams up with Boris Johnson or Michael Gove are going to have to keep on waiting.WITH the Tories in existential crisis, where was the party ­chairman  Pakistan.Ministers were incredulous at the fact that with the party trying to prevent catastrophic losses in both local and European elections, and grassroots activists threatening a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Brandon Lewis was off to Pakistan.Allies of the chairman point out that he was only there for  hours and that the trip was part of a Tory effort to strengthen ­community ties.It’s right that the Tories should want to speak to British Pakistanis more.But Lewis would surely be better off doing that here rather than leaving the country with his party in crisis.BREXIT Britain should reach for the stars. We need to put rocket boosters under our space programme.As research from the think tank Policy Exchange’s new Space Policy Unit highlights, the UK spends ­considerably less on space than every other permanent member of the UN Security Council.With space’s strategic importance only going to grow in the coming years, this needs to changethe UK is not to be left behind.The good news is we have the technical expertise we need in this country.We now just need the Government to get behind a space ­programme and ensure that the UK doesn’t get left at the starting line in this new and more important race.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

None of them are free.Leaders from across our faith communities are standing together to speak out against slavery.Last year the Church of England and the Catholic Church launched the Safe Car Wash App to help drivers report slavery at car washes — one industry alone that’s thought to have thousands of enslaved workers.After just six months, users have reported over , suspected cases, helping the police to tackle this plague.In my own Diocese I know there is crucially important work going on to support these victims.At All Souls Church in Langham Place, at the heart of the West End, the charity Tamar provides essential support and advocacy by reaching out to women who are suffering through sexual exploitation.Tamar takes inspiration from the two stories of women in the Bible being badly mistreated by men and society,The appeal has built on the work of the Clewer Initiative, which has called for a community -wide response to modern slavery — developing partnerships between the Church, statutory and non-statutory agencies, to create a network of advocates seeking to end modern day slavery.As we celebrate the new le of Jesus Christ, let us remember that new le comes not just after death but for those that are living.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.This week’s devastation of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and the remarkable demonstrations of solidarity and generosity that have emerged in its aftermath, are testament to the power of community and show the spirit of resurrection in action.If we could apply that same spirit to the terrible injustice of slavery in our communities, through working together, looking closely for what is hidden in plain sight, and supporting the excellent work of charities, we can give new le to those thousands of victims of modern slavery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others are so embarrassed by their sweating that they feel unable to leave their house.Sweating is a normal physiological process that helps the body to regulate its temperature.When we get too hot or exercise, sweat evaporates from the skin and has a cooling effect.People often also notice they sweat when they are anxious or are in a situation that makes them nervous.But for the roughly  per cent of people who have hyperhidrosis, sweating can be almost constant.The most common areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis are hands, feet, underarms, face, and head, although other areas can be affected too.Some people with hyperhidrosis sweat all over, rather than in just some parts of the body.People with hyperhidrosis often sweat in situations where other people don’t, for example, when the weather is cold.It is not known what causes hyperhidrosis, although it is thought that the nerves that usually make us sweat become over-active.Hyperhidrosis often starts in childhood or adolescence, but can start at any time during le.There is probably a genetic element as well, as there is often a family history in people who have excessive sweating of the hands.Without a clear understanding of what causes hyperhidrosis, it is more challenging to find effective treatments.That is why colleagues and I have been researching the condition.We asked people with hyperhidrosis and healthcare professionals who treat them what questions they would like research to answer.We had  people come forward to suggest nearly  research questions.We found that hyperhidrosis has a wide range of severity.At the mild end of the spectrum, the effects may be minimal – a small inconvenience or minor embarrassment.But as severity increases, the impact on quality of le becomes much more substantial.And the condition can have a huge impact on quality of le, affecting people’s career choices and leading to social isolation.For example, some people have such sweaty hands that it makes it dficult to hold a pen or use a keyboard.People with hyperhidrosis often have anxiety in work situations such as job interviews or meetings where they might be expected to shake hands.Their social le can also be affected, with many people feeling embarrassed by their sweating, and some people have avoided forming intimate relationships due to this.Some people have to change their clothes several times.Many people with hyperhidrosis don’t seek medical help due to the stigma of the condition. They may not even know it is a medical condition at all.Those that do often report dficulties in being taken seriously, lack of access to specialists, and treatment being considered a low priority.There are a number of treatments available for hyperhidrosis, which depend upon the area of the body affected. Temporary treatments include:But these are all temporary, and do not work for everyone.The antiperspirants can cause skin irritation, and oral medication blocks nerve endings throughout the body, so can cause side effects such as a dry mouth and problems urinating.Botox and iontophoresis, meanwhile, need to be repeated regularly and can be expensive.There are also some more permanent solutions available.Some sufferers have had surgery to remove or destroy sweat glands in a localised area, such as the armpits, or endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy , where the nerves that control sweating are cut.ETS is effective in reducing the sweating of the areas intended, but can lead to very serious side effects such as damage to nerves or organs.Most patients end up with some level of sweating in other areas, known as compensatory sweating, and this can be worse than the original problem, so this surgery is generally only used as a last resort.A newer permanent treatment uses electromagnetic energy to destroy sweat glands.Despite being a common skin condition, hyperhidrosis is not widely known about, and research is very poorly funded.Raising awareness is keypeople are to feel comfortable enough to come forward to ask for help and advice."},{"url":null,"title":"kid snatches mcdonalds meal drive thru","story":"The boy was filmed hiding behind a vehicle waiting in the queue before grabbing the bag from the workers hand.Footage filmed from inside the car behind shows the youngster making a dash for the food as they go to pass it to a customer.Those in the vehicle were left in hysterics after watching the kid brazenly take the food at the restaurant chain in Dublin, Ireland.The worker looked confused after the boy grabbed the food from their hand, reports Dublin Live.It is unclear whether the boy ed the food or was confronted by the customer or staff.The video comes after footage emerged which showed a McDonald’s security guard getting battered with a wet floor sign during a brawl in Strood, Kent.Sickening footage showed a man screaming “let’s go, let’s go” after smacking the worker over the head with the sign at am on Easter Sunday."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000484690340.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cathay pacific plane struck lightning shanghai","story":"Delayed Cathay Pacic flight CX is said to have taken off during a thunderstorm from Hong Kong International Airport on Saturday afternoon.According to news outlet HK, those on board feared the plane would fall apart after the lightning bolt struck its right wing.They also told how the packed passenger jet was battered by turbulence for  minutes terrying scores of passengers.Videos and photos posted on the Chinese social media site Weibo by a passenger called Ng Chen-sing show the bolt hit the plane and minor damage to the aircraft’s nose after landing.“I felt the plane was going to fall apart!” Ng said in his post.HK reports that the jet - an Airbus  - is now undergoing routine inspections after landing safely at its destination.One photo appeared to show damage to the jets nose cone.Although clearly frightening for those on board, all modern aircraft are fully protected against lightning strikes, reports Coconuts News.Planes struck during storms are generally inspected after landing, but are usually found not to have been damaged, or to have sustained only minor damage.The Hong Kong Observatory issued a red rainstorm warning on Saturday following a barrage of thunderstorms - which left two dead.The Sun Online has contacted Cathay Pacic for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We know it, the EU know it.“All we need is for the vested interests to climb down - Olly Robbins and the Commission hardliners, Sabine Weyand and Martin Selmayr.”IDS was backed by former Cabinet minister and prominent Remainer Nicky Morgan, who said last night: “The EU has already opened the door to negotiating alternative arrangements with us by December  to avoid the backstop ever being needed.“All it requires is good will and determination on both sides to make the aspiration a promise.”Formal negotiations with the Opposition will restart this afternoon after Parliament s from its Easter break, lead by Cabinet Office Minster David Lidington and Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer.But they are still logjammed by Labour’s red line demand for a customs union, which No so far is refusing to accept.Another option the PM is considering to avoid holding MEP elections is to bring back the Withdrawal Agreement bill this week to give MPs a fourth and final chance to vote for Brexit deal and put it straight into law.The Cabinet will also discuss the cross-party talks’ progress when it meets for the first time in two weeks this morning.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mirror readers are concerned about schools, the homeless, feeding their families, climate change, religious extremism and trying to ensure their kids do not grow up worse off than they are. I suspect they really couldn’t care less about Diane Abbott enjoying a canned mojito on a train last week. Yes, she’s the Shadow Home Secretary, and yes, Transport for London have had an alcohol ban in place since then-London Mayor Boris Johnson announced it in . Abbott broke the law. Yet that law was brought in to address anti-social behavior on public transport. Not -year-old pensioners scrolling through their phones minding their own business. So while Susan Hall, who sits on the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee, stamped her feet in indignation along with Tory MPs Paul Scully and Bob Blackman, ordinary Londoners were just not that bothered.  In fact, Diane’s succinctly-worded tweet on Friday night both pre-empted the controversy and acted as a verbal eye-roll. “A photo of me drinking from a can of MS mojito on the Overground has been circulated,” she wrote. “I’m sincerely sorry for drinking on TFL.” Cue the hashtags #istandwithdiane and #jesuisdiane as ordinary people made their feelings clear. “I spent the day defending her even though I’m not a fan” wrote one tweeter. Hundreds either posted cans they’d bought in solidarity or selfies they’d taken on public transport holding them in support.  When Christians are among the many faiths being targeted around the world and this country remains paralysed by Brexit, the last thing on peoples’ minds – left or right – is a politician in need of a cold one on a hot day. Clearly Abbott’s critics haven’t been on a night bus, a late-night weekend tube or the summer District Line from Wimbledon after the tennis when el vino tends to flow. The real issue is the enforceability of that  law, described back then by Transport Union general secretary Bob Crow as “a half-baked gimmick designed as a publicity stunt without a moment’s thought for the people told to implement it.” Let’s hear what Abbott’s critics intend to do about addressing that.

Change UKwill be trying to scoop up the anti-Brexit vote in what is this groupaposs first ballot box test too.Those fringe movements could hit both Labour and the Tories hard, especially becausethe seats are chosen through a form of proportional representation, andEU elections were previously ripe for protest votes.In the last elections in , UKIP won  seats Labour won  the Tories won  and the Greens won .  Nigel Farage will be leading the charge for his new Brexit Party, which despite only just setting up has enjoyed polling numbers in the mid-teens. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson and Labour peer Maurice Glasman have warned the elite elite-basher poses a serious threat to Labour. He vowed to put the fear of God into our MPs -  they deserve nothing less in comments that led to accusations he was making dog-whistle threats. Lord Buckethead  The comedy character is back after becoming a viral internet sensation when he stood against Theresa May in . This time he is planning to stand against Nigel Farage in South East England.Because he is not part of a list he will need to outstrip the might of the big parties to get elected. But he has been boosted by more than £, in crowdfunding - three times what he needed for his £, deposit. Andrew Adonis  The former minister prompted raised eyebrows when he announced he would be standing for Labour - as second choice for the South West Region. The arch-Remain peer is most definitely not following Jeremy Corbynaposs official line on Brexit. He wants to cancel our leaving the EU - saying Brexit can and should be stopped. Steve Bray  The man who has yelled stop Brexit at Parliament every sitting day for the last  months is standing for the European Parliament.Steve Bray, known locally as the Stop Brexit Guy, began protesting in Westminster in September , wearing a blue and yellow hat and draped in a Union Flag cape.He started as a lone voice, shouting at the seat of democracy once a day. But as time has gone on, and anti-Brexit sentiment has swelled, so has his group of screaming Remainers, hurling an increasingly y stream of invective at the Palace. The UKIP candidate refused to apologise for saying he wouldnapost even rape Labour MP Jess Phillips.The -year-old who styles himself aposSargon of Akkadapos even doubled down, saying his comments were justied because sheaposd been a giant bitch. In combative exchanges, Mr Benjamin - who is second on UKIPaposs South West regional list - told journalists: Iaposm not answering your questions, Iaposm not apologising for anything, you dirty, dirty smear merchants.  Laura Parker The left-winger - fourth on Labouraposs London list - is the most senior woman in the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. That means she is a power player in the partyaposs factional battle between a softer Brexit, none at all, or a second referendum. “If we were staring down the barrel of a no-deal gun, I personally would like to be asked what I thought about that,” she told the BBC last year. Eloise Todd  Eyebrows were also raised when the chief of an anti-Brexit group was selected to run for Labour. Eloise Todd - the CEO of second referendum campaign group Best For Britain - will run as second on the list for Labour in Yorkshire and the Humber. Gerard Batten sdfgdfhfghdfgj Annunziata Rees-Mogg Jacob Rees-Moggaposs SISTER was announced as one of the first candidates for Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party.Annunziata Rees-Mogg - a former Tory candidate who joined the Conservatives at the age of five - is a privately-educated fox hunting supporter once worked on the Brexiteer journal of Tory MP Bill Cash. The -year-old and her brother Jacob are both hard Brexiteers and were among five children of late newspaper editor William Rees-Mogg. She stood for the Tories aged just  in Aberavon, before falling out with the leadership when she stood again in Somerton and Frome in . David Cameron had suggested she refer to herself as aposNancy Moggapos - because her own name sounded too posh - but she refused.  A YouTuber who was fined £ after filming a pug giving a Nazi salute is standing in the European elections for Ukip. Mark Meechan, , who styles himself as Count Dankula on the internet, said he would stand to represent Scotland in the EU. He was handed the fine for recording his girlfriendaposs pet dog, Buddha, responding to statements such as gas the Jews and Sieg Heil by raising its paw. He was found guilty of breaching the Communications Act by posting material that was grossly offensive and anti-Semitic and racist in nature, in an offence aggravated by religious prejudice, following a trial at Airdrie Sherf Court in April last year. He repeatedly refused to pay the fine but had the money seized from his bank account by court officials earlier this year. Ex-MP Katy Clark is a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn as the former political secretary to the Labour leader.She was shunted up to third place in the coveted London list for Labour MEP candidates after a reported battle between factions in the party. As an ally of Labouraposs leader she may introduce a sceptic note among other, far more wildly pro-EU candidates on the partyaposs list. Martin Mayer The Labour candidate shot to prominence after saying he regrets branding anti-Semitism claims a smear to undermine Jeremy Corbyn. Martin Mayer faced anger after an e-mail he sent in  emerged with the title: How Israel lobby manufactured UK Labour partyaposs anti-Semitism crisis.Euan Philipps of the Labour Against Anti-Semitism group said Mr Mayeraposs views have no place in British democracy. Yet Labour sources defended his conduct, saying his remarks are from a few years ago and were not made in the current context. As the fth candidate on a six-strong list in Yorkshire and the Humber, it is almost impossible that he will win enough votes to become an MEP.    Full list of candidates so farNOTE: These lists are currently incomplete as final lists are only due to be released on Friday  April.

She was supposed to be given a chicken breast in a creamy mayonnaise with slow roast tomato topped with crispy iceberg lettuce served in a seeded roll.But says what she was presented with on her March  Heathrow-JFK flight was much less appetising - and she shared a photo of it on Facebook.Her snap shows a rather dry-looking roll with a dash of butter smeared with what appears to be mayonnaise but with little evidence of chicken and none of the tomato. A few bits of limp-looking lettuce have been put on top. British Airways apologised that their standards did not meet the customeraposs expectations on this occasion but said they pride themselves on the quality of the meals offered on board.    Jo, from London, paid around £ for her flight to New York on the way to Miami for a cruise. She claims the airline added insult to injury by leaving her bags behind, meaning she did not get them until the following day. She also claims a BA flight three weeks ago completely ran out of food.Jo uploaded the picture to Facebook last week with the caption: For amusement. Served on a recent LHR to JFK.BA catering getting worse. Many users reacted to Joaposs picture with some sharing their own in-flight experience. Karly Chick said: Absolutely horrendous. Emily Williams added: Thataposs turned my stomach.    Debbie McIntyre wrote: Think youaposd have to snf that, to seethereaposs any chicken or tomatoes have been anywhere near that bread roll. Eduardo R Abreu said: They are despicable. On a recent flight JFK to LHR for breakfast they aposthrewapos a very cold croissant with cream cheese in it - nothing to drink. I threw it right back at them. But Simon Rowland accused Jo of overreacting, writing: Chicken Caesar is definitely chicken in cheesy mayo. Iaposd agree Iaposd have expected tomato whole, not as part of the dressing. But thataposs not worthy of calling it out as some sort of abomination. You flew economy. This is the pre arrival snack. You are badly misrepresenting things.  Jo hit back saying: As I said in my post it was aposfor amusementapos. How can I be aposbadly misrepresenting thingsapos when Iaposve shown a picture  I did not call it out as aposan abominationapos. I have flown BA many times and have done for years. I travel frequently for work and experience a number of airlines. I also travel in a iety of classes and youaposre insinuating that because I was in aposEconomyapos that this food is acceptable. Even the steward was embarrassed to serve this. This should not have been served on any airline, in any class as it is not really fit for purpose. Speaking today Jo said: I canapost remember what the first meal service was as I didnapost eat it and this roll was served pre landing. I was not impressed when I saw it. I am just shocked that whoever made this roll thought it was acceptable. The steward seemed a bit embarrassed too. Also on this flight, mine was the only suitcase that wasnapost loaded so they lost my baggage too. I did get it the next day but Iaposve still to get an explanation or apology from British Airways. I just think the decline in service and they donapost care attitude is getting worse.  Jo was not impressed with the company three weeks prior when she was ing from Moscow, Russia to London Gatwick Premium Economy. She claimed that the company had run out of meals and told her that she would have to eat the bread rolls. She said: British Airways ran out of one of the main meals and unfortunately I couldnapost eat either of the other two choices, so the attendant told me Iaposd just have to aposeat bread rollsapos. I did write and complain and did get an apology from them.

Danny Colwill booked an Easter Bank Holiday trip  for his parter Cha Rowe and their two children, Ruby and Reggie at Trelawne Manor Holiday Park in Plymouth. But they were horried when they claim they arrived for their two-day break to find used razors in the bathroom and sick and faeces on the walls of a bedroom. They were first wary of the caravan when three-year-old Reggie came out of the bathroom holding a blood-stained disposable razor.Danny said they then found blood stains on the wall, human faeces on the bed and sick in the childrenaposs bedroom, reports Plymouth Live .Bosses at the holiday park, near Looe, have apologised and admitted the caravan was not clean enough. Danny said: We arrived at Trelawne Manor on Saturday, we got to the caravan and as we have walked through the door my little boy asked to use the toilet.    He came back out swinging a dirty, used razor, which was left in there on the side. He is only three so, as you can imagine, I went absolutely mental. There were holes in the walls of the caravan, we went to put our bags on the bed, we saw spots of blood and human faeces on there. I have then gone into the kitchen to put some bags on the side and there was food and tomato sauce squirted in all the knives and fork drawers. We then went into the kids bedroom and there was sick on the bed, blood on the walls. After complaining to park staff, they were  offered food vouchers as compensation originally before later being offered half of their money back. Danny said that he was eventually offered a full refund but there were no alternative places for them to stay so they had toto their home. Danny said: I kicked off, I asked someone to come up and they offered us a free meal voucher and I said ‘I don’t think so’. I paid £ a night to stay there and didn’t think it was acceptable. I then went to speak to the person that was in charge as the manager wasn’t in and she said the best she could do was give us half our money back. I didn’t think that was good enough, I didn’t want to stay in there. We all left and went to the Sumggleraposs Inn for food to give them a chance to give us a new caravan or to clean it.    I rang them and the person then said they would give us a full refund and told us to pop the keys in on the way out, which wasn’t very professional. So I went back to get our stuff, went to reception which was full of people and made a scene and showed them why we were going, I showed everyone the photos. The park manager then came out full of apologies and rather than wait for the money to go back on my card, he gave me the money back in cash. Duncan Lancaster, general manager of Trelawne Holiday Park, confirmed that Danny had made a complaint and whilst he couldnapost offer a reason as to why the caravan was left in such a bad condition, he said that they did all they could to resolve the issue. Mr Lancaster said: Mr Colwill came to reception and he would have discussed with colleagues to start with, airs of concern and yes he spoke to my housekeeper. When he expressed his concerns, of course we would listen to the customer and try and resolve matters accordingly. It is a bit unfair to say he was only offered food vouchers, I think there was a little bit of understanding as to what Mr Colwill’s complaint was at that particular time. I know the company guest relation manager is making contact with Mr Colwill in order to resolve matters moving forward as well with him. I have been here  years as a general manager and no I can never explain why, I wasn’t there, I don’t clean the units as I am sure you can understand. Sadly, why a unit was [in that condition], I don’t know is the answer, I can’t answer that.    I can only deal with a situation once I am aware of it, step up to the plate, meet with the customer, ensure the customer is looked after to the best of our ability. Because of the Bank Holiday period, we were unable to find an alternative unit which would have been, at every stage, our first line of option for them. Danny confirmed that he had been contacted by a member of staff and told that they would speak to customer care and offer them a free weekend. But he also said that the experience has left his six-year-old daughter Ruby distressed and stated that he would never go on holiday with them again. Mr Lancaster added: In fairness to John Fowler Holidays and Trelawne Manor Holiday Park, we service a signicant number of customers. We maintain a large quantity of properties and units andsadly and regrettably as in this situation, a unit fell short, the only thing I can then do is apologise to the customer and try and resolve matters moving forward. We do lots of work behind the scenes but on the day when I have a customer that is sadly unhappy, the focus is to try and address their concern first and then clary moving forward. We are a service industry led trade and it is in our best interest to make sure thatsomething is missed, we need to address matters. We are a family-led and family-run business and organisation and from a customer service point of view, we endeavour really hard to deliver a high quality product to the best of our ability and get it right in many occasions. Occasionallysomething is missed we have to address matters.

Denmarkaposs richest man can often be spotted driving his battered old Volkswagen, which he prefers over the luxury cars he could have bought with his fortune, the Mail Online reports. A picture of a loving father who raised his family with down-to-earth, environmentally-friendly values despite his soaring wealth is emerging the day after the ASOS billionaire learnt his children were among the at least  people killed in the attacks. At least  more people were wounded in the blasts that ripped through Sri Lanka in six almost simultaneous suicide bombings that targeted churches and hotels over Easter.    Mr Povslen is the biggest stakeholder in online fashion giant ASOS, and he also owns the Bestseller clothing chain. He was visiting Sri Lanka on holiday with his partner and four children and it is understood the siblings were killed in one of the hotel bombings. Just days before the tragedy, Mr Povslen revealed his plans to give his Scottish estates to his four children. The six blasts hit St Anthonyaposs Shrine in the countryaposs capital Colombo, as well as the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La and Kingsbury hotels in the city, and at two more churches outside Colombo.  Denmark has confirmed three of its nationals died in the attacks carried out by suicide bombers. The Sri Lankan government today blamed little-known Islamic extremist group National Thowheed Jamath for carrying out the massacres, and said it would be seeking support from outside countries, saying the plot involved an international network. Its Ministers also admitted there were several attempts by friendly country to alert the Sri Lankan authorities to the prospect of Easter weekend terror attacks, that it failed to act on. The Povslen childrenaposs tragic deaths were confirmed this morning by an ASOS spokesman - however it has not been confirmed which three of the coupleaposs children died.    Three days before the attacks, Mr Povlsenaposs daughter Alma shared a family holiday photo of her siblings Astrid, Agnes and Alfred - calling them three little bears - in front of a swimming pool lined by palm trees. All four of the children share names beginning with aposAapos. Scananian Povlsen, who inherited his fatheraposs fashion empire Bestseller, reportedly lives with partner Anne Storm Pederson at Constantinsborg, a former royal palace near Aarhus, east Denmark.    He fell in love with the Scottish Highlands when he visited as a young boy in the s, and for more than a decade he has been snapping up vast swathes of the landscape. The Mail Online reports the couple sent their four children to state schools. The wealthy couple own a multi-million-pound property portfolio in sites of , acres across Sutherland and the Grampian mountains - about one per cent of Scotlandaposs land.    The family ides their time between their Danish former palace and a property at ,-acre Glenfeshie in the Cairngorms, which Mr Povslen acquired for £.million in . The Scottish estates are at the heart of the coupleaposs ambitious reforestation project focused on ing their land to its natural state in a -year vision. Mr Povslen has spoken of his passion for re-wilding - in which landowners allow the natural environment and native animals to reclaim the land - which reportedly involves planting millions of trees and culling the swelling deer population. In an open letter, he and his partner wrote of their plan to leave their Scottish estates and re-wilding project to their children after they died. The couple wrote of having a deep connection with Scotlandaposs magnicent landscapes, and said their lelong commitment was to preserve the land for the Scottish people, not only their own family.

I realised that the sofa was a sofa bed. I thought, thataposs OK, the girls can sleep with me. But she was appalled when she looked further and found damp on the walls, a coat hanger hanging off a curtain rail and a aposgrubbyapos mattress.    In the bathroom there was no shower curtain, she said. The chalet had been cleaned. But in the fridge there was some milk dated April  - the smell, I was retching and so was my eldest daughter. There was mould in the fridge and my four-year-old started crying. Samantha says she went back to the reception and complained about the accommodation conditions.  She says a receptionist offered for the chalet to be cleaned but what with thoughts of the mould, Samantha said no. There were no other rooms available due to Easter bookings, so Samantha filled out a complaint form and decided to head home. The girls broke their hearts, she said. This was our first holiday after my husband and I split in July. I wouldnapost go back eventhey offered me a free holiday. I got home and spent the night crying. I felt like I had failed my kids.

The rosy cheeked royal, who turns one on Tuesday, giggles as he gets covered in greenery while crawling about in the garden, proudly showing off his two little front teeth. These adorable photographs taken by his mum Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, have been released by the Royal Family as they celebrate Louis’s first birthday. The youngster, who is the third and youngest child of Kate, , and Prince William, , is pictured playing in the grounds of the family’s Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, in photographs taken earlier this month. In two of the photos, Louis’s rosy cheeks match his red jumper.  In the third he is wearing a blue jumper with a dog mot and looks more serious – though there is still the hint of a smile from the playful prince. The mischievous energy in these snaps is typical of the tireless tot, who loves to play with big brother George, five, and sister Charlotte, three. A royal source said: “He is the most delightful boy, always happy and smiling. He is adored by all the family, especially his big brother and sister.” In March, Kate revealed that Louis, then about  months old, was an active child.  She told a fellow parent during a visit to a children’s centre: “He just wants to pull himself up all the time. He’s got these little walkers and is bombing around on them.” A photo released soon after Louis was born showed him being cuddled by Charlotte on her third birthday, when he was only about a week old. In November, Kate said during a visit to Leicester University: “Louis is getting bigger. I can’t believe he’s seven months. He’s getting a big boy.”    Sporting his usual big grin, the prince was last pictured about four months ago with his family for their official Christmas card. The little prince, whose full name is Louis Arthur Charles, is fth in line to the throne. And yesterday the sixth in line, his uncle Prince Harry , released some snaps of his own on the Instagram page he launched this month with we Meghan.  They marked Earth Day by sharing eight snaps showcasing their passion for the environment, including the pair pictured in Rotorua, New Zealand, last year. Yesterday it was claimed the security bill for their possible move to Africa could cost taxpayers around £million a year. Advisers are reportedly working to create a Commonwealth role for the pair that could mean them moving there for up to three years.  It would require a dedicated team of royal protection officers for each of them. A security source said: “The cost of protecting high profile royals would be at least £million a year, most likely more with round-the-clock personal protection officers, in-country teams and British security services monitoring potential threats against them. “It would be paid for from taxpayer funds while police and the security services are already stretched. It’s a mighty big ask.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror world family nations","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: A world family of nations must help Sri Lanka get justiceTerrorism is an indiscriminate enemy and Britain needs to join in a united effort to stand against itShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  APR NewsopinionBomb blast inside a church in Negombo, Sri Lanka \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe unbearable pain of families who lost loved ones in the Easter Massacre in Sri Lanka is heartbreaking.

The CCTV clip reportedly shows one of the attackers entering St Sebastianaposs Church in Negombo on Easter Sunday. An estimated  people were killed in co-ordinated attacks. The man can be seen walking into the church as worshippers congregated, casually stepping past people inside. Moments later the bomb was detonated, Indian channel  TV - which broadcast the clip - reports.     Sri Lanka today said it was invoking emergency powers in the aftermath of devastating bomb attacks on hotels and churches, blamed on militants with foreign links. The emergency law, which gives police and the military extensive powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders, will go into effect at midnight on Monday, the presidentaposs office said. Police said  bomb detonators were found at Colomboaposs main bus station, while an explosive went off near a church where scores were killed on Sunday when bomb squad officials were trying to defuse it.    A night curfew will go into effect at pm, the government announced. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack but suspicion was focusing on Islamist militants in the Buddhist-majority country. Investigators said seven suicide bombers took part in the attacks while a government spokesman said an international network was involved. Police had received a tip-off of a possible attack on churches by a little-known domestic Islamist group some  days ago, according to a document seen by Reuters.    The intelligence report, dated April , said a foreign intelligence agency had warned authorities of possible attacks on churches by the leader of the group, the National Thawheed Jamaaposut. It was not immediately clear what action,any, was taken on the tip-off. Police said  people had been arrested, all of whom were Sri Lankan, but they gave no more details.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bank injects tens thousands pounds","story":"NewsBank injects tens of thousands of pounds to revamp Ayrshire branchGiant lodges application with councilShareByStephen Houston:,  APR NewsAyr High Street branch, Bank Of Scotland\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMajor investment is being made to spruce up the Bank of Scotland in Ayr.

And what better way to celebrate the religious holiday this year by visiting Ayr’s oldest church. Thought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history. Visible from the A, the ‘country church’ was originally a rural Parish church dating back to the late th   early th centuries. It has been a living, working church without interruption ever since. The Church of Scotland branch has seen many changes over the years. In , the church on the Auchincruive site was originally called Sanchar-in-Kyle and was described as a rectory. In , it was mentioned in connection with the founding of the Gilbertine Priory of St Mary at Dalmulin within the Parish and in  came under the ownership of Paisley Abbey when the monks left Dalmulin. At this time it was a Roman Catholic Church and after the Reformation in , and the movement away from Rome, the church became used for the Protestant form of worship.  In , a major restoration was carried out to the original long church with the addition of a T-shaped wing. A relic wooden ladle used for the collection and communion cups, said to have been presented in , are still in use today. The last structural change to the church was seen in the early th century when the Whitletts and Craigie Galleries were added above each end of the original long church. The outside gallery stairs, still in existence, speak of an older time when the landed gentry did not mix with the people seated in the body of the kirk. And it’s hard to believe that back in those days there was very much a ide among the congregation between rich and poor. But that’s certainly not the case now. Church member and Convener for Fundraising and Events, Margaret McConnell said: “It’s always been quite a poor church. “The members and residents were either miners or worked on the fields. “Of course, there were quite a lot of farmers in the area but they were the wealthy ones.”  Speaking of the upper central gallery, Interim Moderator Rev Ken Yorke said: “That’s where the lords and ladies sat. “There was a fireplace up there and the story goes that when the local gentry was sitting there,he didn’t like what the minister was saying, he’d get up from his seat and go over to the fire and sit and warm himself.” Session Clerk David McMahon joked: “We don’t have any original members left anymore.” Margaret has a long standing relationship with the St Quivox, Auchincruive. She originally went to the church as a young girl then lived overseas for several years. But she admits finding her aunt Elizabeth’s grave in the church’s graveyard brought her “back to her roots”. She said: “Faith is a journey. “I joined the church  years ago. “My family were local residents and granny came to the church every Sunday.  “They were from Whitletts and used to walk along the Low Road, but now that’s the bypass.” Her family sat in one of the galleries, to the left of the minister. She later married in the church in . And it seems ministry runs in the family for Rev Ken too, whose father was a minister at Prestwick South for  years. Rev Ken said: “It’s not all about the minister though– we have faithful people who help out.

Margaret said: “Hosting the Holy Week Services at Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive provides a great opportunity for us to let everyone in the community know that the beautul old church is still open to all and welcomes everyone. “We would also like to extol the historical importance and the heritage of Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, as two of its former ministers were Moderators of the General Assembly – one of whom, Rev Archibald H Charteris, began ‘Le and Work’ magazine and also founded the Women’s Guild.” And although very proud of their beautul and historically rich place of worship, the trio agreed “the church is the people – not the building”.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14418225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_070319bypass_01JPG.jpg","title":"maybole bypass could create up","story":"NewsMaybole bypass could create up to  jobs, says the Scottish GovernmentThe official award of the construction contract has fired the starting gun on the long-awaited project.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsAn overview of the bypass route \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe project to build a bypass for Maybole could employ up to , it has been claimed.

Instead of resting on their laurels with this investment, I’ll continue to challenge the Scottish Government to set out a long term plan for further bypasses and more dual carriageway that will bring the A up to the standard drivers expect from a trunk road and help grow the economy across Ayrshire.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish GovernmentAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"type 2 perfect 10","story":"NewsFrom Type  to a perfect A student has managed to reverse her type  diabetes after shedding a third of her body weight.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsKaty McMillan, , from Troon, reversed type- diabetes\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKaty McMillan, , has gone from injecting insulin four times a day to not at all after slimming down to just st lb. The trainee paramedic was a size  and had a body mass indexof . when she was diagnosed with the disease at . At just ft tall and weighing st lbs, she was horried with the way she looked. Katy, from Troon, recalled: “When I look back, it feels like the big me with type  diabetes is a dferent person. “I was so self-conscious, and embarrassed to have type  diabetes so young and to have to inject in front of people.” Katy first attended a slimming group at , but struggled to lose any weight with it. And when doctors discovered her diabetes as she prepared for surgery to correct an underdeveloped jaw, she lost her confidence even more. She explained: “I was all geared up for the surgery. I’d been so self-conscious about both my weight and my jaw. I just wanted to get it sorted. “But, as the doctors were prepping me, they realised my blood sugar levels were sky high. The surgery was postponed as they ran tests, which showed I had type  diabetes. “Looking back, I’d had signs, like constant thirst, tiredness, and needing to go to urinate all the time, but I’d been too scared to go and have it all confirmed. “The diagnosis itself was devastating. I remember being shown how to inject myself, trying to do it and just sobbing, saying I couldn’t. “I then had to deal with going back to school and adjusting to this new le. I didn’t want anyone to see me injecting, and felt so embarrassed. “At that age, you just want to be like everyone . It was hell.” She went on: “I would eat rubbish – big plates of chips for lunch, then take-aways in the evening. “I did very little exercise too. I’d not long passed my driving test, so drove absolutely everywhere – including to the McDonald’s drive-thru most evenings.” Things changed for Katy when, in April , a Facebook post about WW – the new Weight Watchers – caught her eye. After initially trying out the plan, she was shocked to discover she had reduced her blood sugar levels to match those of someone without type  diabetes. She continued: “I saw these amazing before and after pictures and thought, ‘That’s what I want.’ “I knewI didn’t do it then I never would, so I contacted my WW leader Morag and went down to a meeting. “They explained how to use their SmartPoints system, which tracks food and drink to nudge users towards a more nutritious diet. “It made complete sense to me and I especially loved the app, enabling you to scan food in the supermarket and find out how many points it’s worth. “I’d tried other regimes in the past and hadn’t stuck to them, as they were so impractical. You can’t exactly go out to a restaurant and eat weight loss shakes or supplements. “But I liked WW as it didn’t bring attention to the fact I was trying to slim down. I could still eat the foods I liked, but it taught me about moderation and to stop pushing myself to eat when I was full.” Katy eventually hit her current weight of st lb and has never been happier. She no longer needs to inject insulin, she just takes two Metformin tablets a day – a drug often used to treat type  diabetes. The charity Diabetes UK says that though there is no guarantee that the condition has gone forever – it is possible to go into remission – and losing around kgincreases the chances of doing so. Katy now lives on fresh, home-cooked meals, prepared from scratch and hits the gym three times a week, where she does cardio and lts weights. She said: “My advice to anyone  out there feeling how I once did is just to take those first steps, go to that first meeting. “It doesn’t take long for change to happen. You can still go out, have fun and socialise too. “You don’t need to stop your le in order to feel dferent.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrBMIFacebookSupermarketsEducationSocial mediaTroon"},{"url":null,"title":"wellswood property week","story":"NewsWellswood is property of the weekNeighbouring homes have sold for £, or moreShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of the lovely villas on the right as you head to the Brig O’ Doon is seeking a new owner.

Corum say: “It would ideally suit the large family or indeed those clients downsizing from a larger property given the facility of all on the level accommodation.” There is broad reception hall, formal lounge, family TV room, large games room with full size snooker table, rear dining room or extra bedroom. A handy office has a window to the rear and there are three double bedrooms, one of which is en-suite. The modern family bathroom has a bath and separate shower. The loft is floored so feasibly there is room to supersize. Outside the mature gardens offer a pleasant mix of soft and hard landscaped areas including extensive lawn with mature trees and borders. The monobloc carriage drive gives access to a double garage with remote control access. And the agents point out the back garden enjoys south westerly sunlight.

The event involved a successful partnership between South Ayrshire Council, Scottish Rowing, University of West of Scotland and Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. And it’s believed to be the first time in  years that an organised water-based activity has taken place on the River Ayr. The event was designed to encourage young people to interact safely with the river and get fit and active at the same time. Many of the participants will be undertaking Duke of Edinburgh Gold Awards in the summer and this event was the perfect warm-up. All the young adults were given a safety briefing by representatives from Scottish Rowing, the council and South Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. They were then allocated their equipment before the group all had the opportunity to try out a single scull, open canoe and a costal boat, setting off along an m course. During the day they all received expert tuition from experienced rowers and instructors. Belmont Academy pupil Alex Crooks, aged , said: “It was something new, a new experience. “I’m doing canoeing for my Duke of Edinburgh award, so it’s about getting experience of the water and the river. I enjoyed it.” Ben Gilmour, aged , a pupil at Prestwick Academy, said: “It was good. “We get out and do free things and it’s good way to spend your time, instead of playing the X-Box! “I do sailing and I do figure skating but I’ve never come out and done loads of watersports . “This has been good and you get to meet new people as well.” It’s hoped that the programme will spark renewed interest in rowing and watersports, given the River Ayr’s proximity to Ayr Academy. Backing the event was the RNLI , who through their Respect the Water campaign, were able to reinforce the key messages about staying safe. The participants were also given a waterproof mobile phone cover, along with literature about water safety, as a thank-you for taking part. Tess Crooks who goes to Belmont Academy said: “It was a fun and enjoyable day, I would like to do more and get to learn new skills on the water.” Ryan Matthews, an apprentice from GE Caledonian, said: “It was a very enjoyable experience and good training for my DofE Gold canoeing expedition later in the summer. “It also made me realise the fitness required for this type of activity and how I need to get fitter.” Councillor William Grant, Children and Young People Portfolio Holder for South Ayrshire Council, said: “South Ayrshire has outstanding natural resources available to everyone. “This is a great way for young people to explore nature, increase their confidence and learn new skills at the same time. “We need to respect all our waterways but rivers should also be enjoyed and the young people taking part clearly had a great time thanks to the expert supervision.” Vincent McWhirter, RNLI Volunteer Community Safety Officer said: “We have  miles of coast line from Barassie to Ballantrae with four main rivers and numerous lochs all of which are very attractive but can also be potentially dangerous, so it was really worthwhile to teach the young people new skills and at the same time learn about the hazards but in a fun way.” If you are interested in taking up rowing, you can contact Scottish Rowing https:www.scottish-rowing.org.uk , Ayrshire Coastal Rowing Clubs: Troon Coastal Rowing https:en-gb.facebook pg TroonCoastalRowingClub posts , Prestwick Coastal Rowing https:www.prestwicksailingclub prestwick-coastal-rowing-club , Carrick Coastal Rowing www.carrickcoastalrowing.org, Girvan Coastal Rowing girvan.rowing@btinternetLike us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"horse-cruelty-trial-delayed-until-july","story":"THE trial of a Selkirk man accused of causing unnecessary suffering to horses in his care has been put off until the summer.Nick Mill, of Ettrickhaugh Road, previously denied the two charges at the towns sherf court and a trial was fixed for April .But at an intermediate hearing it was stated that pressure of business on that day with other trials meant it was unlikely to go ahead.As a result a new trial date has been set for July .The -year-old has been charged under the Animal Health and Welfare Scotland Act.It is alleged he failed to get proper veterinary care for a horse that was emaciated and another which had an infected tail.The offences are said to have happened at the Lauriston Stables in Ettrickhaugh Road between April  and July  last year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-weight-loss-groups-raise-3k-for-charity","story":"Local members of a weight-loss company have raised pound, by donating clothes that no longer fit to charity.The Galashiels Slimming World groups collected  bags of clothes, shoes, homeware and accessories to donate to Cancer Research UK.The initiative aims to raise awareness of how keeping a healthy weight can reduce the risk of developing some types of cancer.Slimmers donated clothes they were confident they wouldnrsquot need again after following a weight-loss plan.Claire Ford, who runs the Galashiels Slimming World groups at Galashiels Rugby Club, said: ldquoI canrsquot quite believe how many bags we managed to collect, and the fact we found some gold ones too, I canrsquot wait to seeany of my members are winners!

She started by telling us that her vaccination was in the thigh, as it was for other girls, so that it didnrsquot mar the upper arm, just in case that girl, might later in le, wear a sleeveless evening dress - how thoughtful of the doctor! We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others.

New products shouldnrsquot be introduced without showing that to be the case.ldquoItrsquos not whether e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes, itrsquos whether they are actually safe.ldquoThen,they are going to be demonstrated as a quitting aid, yoursquove got to demonstrate that they are really a quitting aid and that they are at least as safe as or better than other products.ldquoBut that has not been done. There is not the evidence at the population level that they are a useful quitting aid.He said PHE was turning a blind eye to increasing evidence that youngsters are trying vaping and are attracted to e-cigarette brands and marketing.A report published by PHE in February said that regular use of e-cigarettes among young people remains low.But its figures showed that the number of UK children and teenagers trying vaping has doubled in recent years.Some .% of children aged  to  reportedhaving tried vaping, according to  data, a rise from .% in .The proportion who said they had never tried e-cigarettes fell from .% in  to .% in .Prof McKee said there was ldquoa worrying trend of e-cigarettes clearly being made attractive to youngsters.ldquoIt is now very clear these products are being pushed very hard to children, he said.ldquoThis creates an entirely avoidable risk of a new generation that will be addicted to nicotine.Hewarned that youngsters could become hooked on Juul, ane-cigarette that has been blamed in the US for creating nicotine addiction in children, and which was introduced to the UK market last summer.ldquoWhy would British children be any dferent to American children in that respect , he said.Prok McKee also called for tighter regulation of the whole e-cigarette market.ldquoI think e-cigarettes should be regulated as medicines which means yoursquove got to demonstrate that they are safe and effective, he said. ldquoItrsquos as simple as that.And he attacked voluntary codes of conduct adopted by the e-cigarette industry, adding: ldquoNobody in public health should take voluntary codes of conduct at all seriously.ldquoTherersquos loads of research showing that voluntary agreements donrsquot work.He continued:ldquoTobacco firms are doing a lot of brand stretching here.

Theyrsquove advocated for less regulation of e-cigarettes to make it easier for people to take up these devices and I donrsquot agree with that.He added: ldquoYou can go into a pound store anywhere in the country and buy e-cigarette liquid for pound.ldquoYou can do that with very little regulation, so itrsquos very easy for example for kids to get that, itrsquos very accessible.Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE, said: ldquoWhile research on e-cigarettes continues to emerge we must act on what the current evidence tells us.ldquoThere is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking.ldquoThis view is held by many across the world, including the Royal College of Physicians, Cancer Research UK, the British Medical Association and the National Academy of Sciences in the US.ldquoThere is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping.Prof Newton said PHE was ldquoalert to the risks and the UK had taken a ldquocareful approach to maximise the opportunities that e-cigarettes present to help more smokers quit.An estimated  in  patients in acute hospital beds in England are smokers.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

I believe the whole concept of a referendum on anything should be re-considered in the future simply because there is now an established mindset that only another referendum can overturn a previous one.Nevertheless, I also believe, having spurned the idea of a second referendum, that the extra time granted to the UK in leaving the EU to reconsider what is rather flippantly referred to as a deal, should have an imperative addendum. The so-called deal should have provision regarding the terms incorporated in it to facilitate the UK easily rejoining the EU within a certain political timeframe. It should include reference to the existing designated parameters to avoid any future terms to our possible detriment, more especially that we would continue on re-joining to retain the pound sterling.Democracy, as such, will have been seen to be done on leaving the EU and we should move on. I consider that given the self-inflicted state which the Labour Party is in, it could only be elected to governmentseeking to rejoin the EU, without a referendum, was their main manesto agenda.

South Erskine Park, BearsdenWELL over four years ago, the Queen gatecrashed the Scottish Referendum causing disbelief and turmoil. Commentators now acknowledge that she urged the electorate to vote for the Union. The media endlessly repeated the actual royal words and it became auto-suggestion. No constitutional expert intervened. Many voters believed that the Queen had acted spontaneously, which is not the case.Alan Cochranersquos Diaries, Alex Salmond: My Part In His Downfallrefute that possibility. The diary entries for September  include the following sentence: ldquoIt was also a bit of a triumph for Chris Evans who began a lsquoQueen should speakrsquo campaign a couple of weeks ago. Mr Cochrane also says: ldquoThis was a completely deliberate and put-up job by the Palace. He even goes further: ldquoBut it was also a bit of a coup for the Palace and the Queen herself. There is absolutely no doubt that she did it deliberately and knew exactly what the effect would be ndash it was the splash everywhere. Fantastic.The plot became a reality at Crathie when the press, invited by the police ldquocould get over to where they could hear what was going on and thatrsquos how the Queenrsquos remarks got out. The Queen actually said words to the effect that the electorate should think very carefully about the future. Was this scripted  Reports of the time said that a young couple were also kept in reserve on a promise of meeting the Queen. Was that a back-up Presuming that she was familiar with the press reports from Crathie and thereafter, the Returning Officer would have been aware of the signicant outside pressure which unduly influenced the entire election. This was not a fair contest as the Yes campaign could not match the leverage of the Crown. In simple terms, at Crathie, voters had been urged to review their preferences in the forthcoming Independence referendum. If democracy matters, the Returning Officer should have declared the process invalid.Any fair-minded person would realise that the First Minister of Scotland does not have to plead with anyone to hold a second referendum.

Read about @murdo_frasers paper for Bright Blue here: https:t.co gHthXCEfXmdash Bright BlueApril , Mr Fraser said:ldquoWith nationalists in dferent parts of the United Kingdom seeking to use Brexit uncertainty for their own political ends, it is important that unionists have a coherent response.ldquoIntroducing a UK-wide Senate delivers the long-awaited and overdue reform of the House of Lords, giving a better balance to the UK constitution and protecting the interests of the nations and regions furthest from London.ldquoA new quasi-federal settlement can mitigate concerns that exist in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and also are growing in many parts of England, about an over-centralised state where, despite asymmetric devolution over a period of two decades, there is still pressure for more power to be passed down from the centre.The report argues the House of Lords should be abolished and replaced with a new Senate, or Upper House, representing dferent parts of the UK.: LettersInjustice of the House of LordsThis should be predominantly ndashnot entirely ndash elected, fulfilling the role both of a revising chamber and as a counterweight to the Commons.It calls for anew Statute or Charter of Union, which would declare the creation of a quasi-federal state and provide legislation for the UKrsquos intergovernmental work.A new UK Council of Ministers should replace theexisting Joint Ministerial Committee system, it says, with a need for England to have representatives elected by an English Grand Committee.Ryan Shorthouse, director of Bright Blue, said:ldquoOur departure from the EU provides the impetus to introduce important governmental and constitutional reforms to create a lsquoquasi-federalrsquo future for the four nations of the union.ldquoNotwithstanding the dficulties and isions Brexit has created, it does offer an opportunity for overdue democratisation and modernisation of key institutions of the union.SNP MSP Tom Arthur said: \"Even the Scottish Tories now admit that support for independence is on the rise because of the way Scotland has been utterly ignored throughout the Brexit process.\"Murdo Frasers comments show that the Scottish Tories are rattled - they are running scared of independence because they know that recent experience of a broken Westminster system will only lead more people to support Scotland taking its own decisions.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9723221.jpg?type=article-full","title":"number-of-pupils-with-special-needs-soaring","story":"The Scottish Children Services Coalition analysed the annual Scottish Government Pupil Census and found large increases in most categories of pupils requiring additional support.The number of pupils requiring support for mental health problems has more than tripled between  and , up  per cent.Those with communication support needs have increased by % in the same period, while pupils identied as having autism spectrum disorder have more than doubled, rising by %.Students needing help at school for physical health problems have risen by % in the six-year period, while those with social, emotional and behavioural dficulties have increased by %.:Vital allowance for poorer pupils falls by pound. millionStudents with dyslexia have risen % and those requiring help with English as an additional language have more than doubled, up by %.All  categories record an increase between  and , apart from pupils requiring support for a learning disability which fell by %.The figures are for publicly funded primary, secondary and special schools.Overall, the number of pupils with additional support needs has risen by % between  and , from , to ,.Pupils with additional support needs now make up more than a quarterof all pupils.The commission said the increase is partially due to increased recognition and diagnosis of conditions, as well as improvements in recording, and this helps target support and funding.However, it highlighted drops in per-pupil funding and specialist teachers, and called for the necessary resources to be made available.:Teachers at risk over ineffective approach to problem pupilsThe census figures indicate the number of full-time equivalent specialist teachers supporting ASN pupils has fallen by  between  and , from , to ,.Spending has fallen by an average of pound per pupil between the pound, in   to pound, in   -

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was brought in to streamline the benefits process but has faced severe criticism and been subject to several delays.The committee report acknowledged the system is ldquolikely to stay but called for ldquofundamental urgent changes to its design, including cutting waiting times for payments and bringing in additional support for claimants. The report also called for an end to in-work sanctions, scrapping the benefits freeze, said Universal Credit is a ldquosignicant cause in the rise of food banks, and claimed the DWP made a ldquoserious error of judgment in cutting jobcentres in Scotland while rolling out the new benefit system.Conservative members of the committee, Jeremy Balfour and Michelle Ballantyne, dissented from some of the reportrsquos conclusions.The SNPrsquos Alasdair Allan, who sits on the committee, said: ldquoThis report is a stark warning from those at the front line of the fight against poverty, and yet another example of Westminsterrsquos failures ndash it confirms the disastrous impact the Toryrsquos welfare cuts and sanctions are having on vulnerable people across Scotland.ldquoItrsquos clear that Tory MSPs have their heads firmly in the sand over their Westminster colleaguesrsquo deeply harmful welfare policies.ldquoThey remain in denial over the damage this welfare system is causing, with people struggling to pay for essentials even though they have a job.ldquoThe Scottish Government is already taking action, but therersquos a limit to what we can do with one hand tied behind our back.ldquoIf the UK Government does not urgently reform the welfare system, in-work poverty will rise further, as working people transfer to Universal Credit and find themselves worse off.A DWP spokeswoman said: ldquoEmployment is at a record high, wages are outstripping inflation and income inequality and absolute poverty are lower than in . ldquoSanctions are only used in a small minority of cases and only when people donrsquot fulfil their agreed commitments to look for work. But we know some families need more support, which is why we continue to spend pound billion a year on working-age benefits.ldquoMeanwhile, Scotland has signicant welfare powers, can top up existing benefits, pay discretionary payments and create entirely new benefits altogether.copy -.

Calling for the Scottish Government to urgently address the situation, Mr Deerin added: ldquoWe are in real danger of opening up a new type of attainment gap in Scotland ndash one where children who are allowed to sit eight or nine National s or s will have a distinct advantage over those restricted to five or six, regardless of the latterrsquos ability.ldquoThe schools cutting the number of exams on offer are typically those serving our more deprived communities, further limiting the le opportunities of children who may already be disadvantaged.Freedom of Information requests by the group revealed that, in , all schools in Edinburgh, East Dunbartonshire and Dumfries and Galloway offered eight exams now no schools in either East Dunbartonshire or Dumfries and Galloway offer eight, and the limit in Edinburgh ies between six and eight.The implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence by the Scottish Government has been blamed for the reduction in available subjects, which critics say shows the ldquohallmark of poor management.Chair of the Commission on School Reform and one of the authors of Curriculum for Excellence Keir Bloomer said: ldquoOne of the purposes of CfE was to broaden pupilsrsquo education, but instead the way in which it is being implemented is narrowing it signicantly.ldquoThere is ample opportunity for pupils to combine practical and academic options when they are enabled to sit nine, eight, or even seven exams, but when we narrow it down to six or five there is very little room for manoeuvre.ldquoReducing the number of subject options is not a government policy. It has come about by accident the unintended consequence of ill-conceived advice. This is the hallmark of poor management.ldquoThis is a lose-lose.A Scottish Government spokeswoman defended the Curriculum for Excellence, claiming it ldquoprovides signicant flexibility and allows schools to ldquohave the freedom to design a bespoke three-year senior phase of a range of courses and qualications tailored to meet the needs of the young people at the school.She added: ldquoWhat matters is the qualications and awards that pupils leave school with, and not only what they study in S.ldquoAlmost two-thirds now leave school in S, and last year a record proportion went on to positive destinations including work, training or further study.ldquoYoung people also now have opportunities to study towards a much broader range of qualications, not just at school, but also at college and through apprenticeships. Scottish Conservative shadow education secretary Liz Smith said: ldquoThis is yet further confirmation of the very serious reduction in subject choice which is affecting so many pupils across Scotland.ldquoIt is a disgrace that the SNP has allowed this situation to develop, most especially when the evidence shows it hits hardest for those in the more deprived communities where the attainment gap is already a major issue.copy -.

He said: ldquoThe nicotine in e-cigarettes is not a harmless drug and then there all these other things such as flavourings that are inhaled.ldquoWe havenrsquot had e-cigarettes for long enough to know the true effects.ldquoBut when we look at the evidence we do have, therersquos enough grounds for serious concerns.ldquoGiven the short-term effects on lungand cardiovascular effects, there is enough evidence to say we should be very, very careful.PHE has campaigned for cigarette smokers to switch to e-cigarettes, and has said they are % less harmful than tobacco smoking ndash a figure disputed by many health experts including Prof McKee.He said PHE had failed to adequately show that e-cigarettes are an effective quitting aid and was ignoring evidence that they cause damage in their own right.He said: ldquoFirst of all, yoursquove got to show that theyrsquore safe. New products shouldnrsquot be introduced without showing that to be the case.ldquoItrsquos not whether e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes, itrsquos whether they are actually safe.ldquoThen,they are going to be demonstrated as a quitting aid, yoursquove got to demonstrate that they are really a quitting aid and that they are at least as safe as or better than other products.ldquoBut that has not been done. There is not the evidence at the population level that they are a useful quitting aid.He said PHE was turning a blind eye to increasing evidence that youngsters are trying vaping and are attracted to e-cigarette brands and marketing.A report published by PHE in February said that regular use of e-cigarettes among young people remains low. But its figures showed that the number of UK children and teenagers trying vaping has doubled in recent years.Some .% of children aged  to  reportedhaving tried vaping, according to  data, a rise from .% in .The proportion who said they had never tried e-cigarettes fell from .% in  to .% in .Prof McKee said there was ldquoa worrying trend of e-cigarettes clearly being made attractive to youngsters.ldquoIt is now very clear these products are being pushed very hard to children, he said.ldquoThis creates an entirely avoidable risk of a new generation that will be addicted to nicotine.Hewarned that youngsters could become hooked on Juul, ane-cigarette that has been blamed in the US for creating nicotine addiction in children, and which was introduced to the UK market last summer.ldquoWhy would British children be any dferent to American children in that respect , he said.Prok McKee also called for tighter regulation of the whole e-cigarette market.ldquoI think e-cigarettes should be regulated as medicines which means yoursquove got to demonstrate that they are safe and effective, he said. ldquoItrsquos as simple as that.And he attacked voluntary codes of conduct adopted by the e-cigarette industry, adding: ldquoNobody in public health should take voluntary codes of conduct at all seriously.ldquoTherersquos loads of research showing that voluntary agreements donrsquot work.He continued:ldquoTobacco firms are doing a lot of brand stretching here.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns.

Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn.

Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from ! I think some of us have moved on a bit since then, Graham Fleming, but there will always be a place for infantile name-calling, especially when a depth of comment is so shallow.Ali’s statement is not one everyone would post. Aberdeen University was rejecting the autocratic imposition of a particularly hard-line act of Islamism. Such Islamism is not Islam. Resisting the Sultan’s imposition of restrictions on the freedoms of others is not Islamaphobic, as Ali may already know. Conflating these issues into a  statement, whilst describing the Sultan as a good Muslim, is something an islamaphobe might do, but pointing this out in neutral terms will probably see me attacked for being intolerant.There are hard-line inflexible dogmatic literalists in all major faiths, and the assembled texts of any faith are often contradictory. There are also people who hide their malicious agendas behind statements that might be designed to appear innocuous at first glance. It may seem a little pointless trying to make this kind of thing clear to closeminded hardliners, but the tricks extremists use to influence others have to be exposed. Otherwise we’ll have to live in the kind of society they want, and heaven help us then. It may help to remember that Scotland only abandoned trying to “cure” homosexuality with electro-shock therapy as recently as . Securing a tolerant global community required international cooperation: hence the EU.Sadly Islamophobia is alive and kicking on Shetland. I had to forcefully point out to one of my former, supposedly rational patients, that her extreme views on immigrants were pure fiction. Her online rant  claim being that our immigrant population were full of infectious diseasesand a danger to ourcommunity. That is a total fiction promoted by a malicious racist. She was mirroring a neo-nazi website sadly with the backing of several Shetland folk. She became very agitated when I pointed out to her oral and general health was no better nor worse than many of my overseas immigrant patients. Needless to say, I was cascaded with a barrage of insults and threats. Thankfully she and her like-minded bigots blocked me on Facebook, thank God for small mercies!I made a conscious decision to stop going to muslim countries  years ago because I saw what was about to happen. Sitting watching a ramadan service on state televisionI was not already aware of what was coming the imam made it quite clear what should happen to the likes of us. I really do suggest you go find out for yourself Peter. To anyone  I say stay away and take the word of those who know better.Very sadly many, many religions have a few thugs and bigots in their ranks posing as priests. Islam and Christianity both have plenty of corrupted teachers and perverted followers. That has absolutely nothing to do with Brexit, but all to do with sectarianism and racism. As I said Islamophobia is alive and well on Shetland, fortunately, such views held by an unpleasant and ignorant minority..."},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\". Pointing out that McBride came before the court with a clear record, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the impact the offending has had on McBrides domestic situation and also on his business as \"people dont want to associate with him because of the nature of the allegations\".Judge Miller said that after reading a pre-sentence report, he felt McBride had displayed both \"an apparent lack of empathy\" for the complainant, and a \"self-centred attitude.\"The judge also cast doubt on McBrides claims he believed the girl was  when they began having sex, saying it was his belief McBride deliberately targeted someone \"half his age\" for his own \"deviant sexual interests\".As well as being jailed, McBride was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic disruption full list of parades including belfast bangor portadown and larne","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That is what is important. So I hope all parties and none will get behind this now.”Large attendance here this afternoon at the formal launch of our Report on Climate Action. @OireachtasNews #ClimateAction pic CwzBrK— Hildegarde NaughtonApril , The report includes a range of actions to address the threat of climate change, including raising carbon taxes from  euro per tonne to  euro per tonne by the year , increasing the share of renewables in electricity generation to % by , improving home retrofitting incentives, restoring peatlands and rewarding farmers for maintaining ecosystems.TDs and senators from Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Labour and the Greens voted in favour of the report but Sinn Fein and People Before Profit opposed it on the basis that carbon taxes will only hurt the poor.“We’ve had enough criticism, we know that we’re laggards. That’s absolutely clear,” she said.“That debate is now over… we have to move on now with the solutions.”Ms Naughton said the yellow vest protests in France had been at the “forefront” of the thoughts of committee members as they considered how to increase carbon taxes in a fair manner.“If we don’t bring people with us this is not going to be a success,” she said.The protesters have staged a series of demonstrations in cities throughout France over high taxes and inequality.The Galway West TD said the committee’s recommendations proved that the Oireachtas is listening to the citizens and the young people who are particularly concerned about the issue.Protesters young and old have taken to the streets across Europe calling on governments to act on climate change.“It is ambitious. It is transformational, but it’s only the start of it, now we have to implement it,” she said.The report is now being considered by Communications Minister Richard Bruton who is preparing the Government’s new strategy to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.Mr Bruton is expected to publish the plan in the coming weeks.The chairwoman is determined that the report, which took seven months to complete, will not end up on the shelf and she said accountability will be key to that.“Richard Bruton is going to have an action plan that will have clear time frames and targets, set out for Government departments,” she said.“If they’re not reaching those, they’ll be able to be called before our committee who will now have Public Accounts Committee-type powers to hold them to account.“So there will be greater accountability and transparency around how we are progressing. That’s what’s transformational about it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may to convene cabinet as mps return to westminster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated. A special mention to chairman Michael Mulholland for organising the transport to the final.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison,Andrew Mulholland , William Edgar, Stuart Hunter, Matthew Martin, Alex Millar, Jason Campbell, Scott Leetch, Luke Curry, Michael Carney, Steven Crean, David Marshall, Josh Higginson.Man of the match: William Edgar.Ballynahinch Limerick IRISH HOCKEY CHALLENGE CUP FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Archaeological dig uncovers skeletons dating back to 8th century  ","story":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL material found at Downpatrickrsquos Cathedral Hill dates back as far as  years after the birth of Jesus.Work from a Queenrsquos University Belfast team of archaeologists has dated skeletons buried some  years later, indicating a sizeable community living in Downpatrick at the time.The material was recovered during last Augustrsquos four-week excavation and community investigation which attracted , visitors from around the world.Local volunteers played a major role in uncovering the history of the site and there is another opportunity to get involved in another dig.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin is urging local people, particularly students, to get involved in another dig which is to take place this August.ldquoI visited the archaeological dig on Cathedral Hill several times in August last year and was impressed by the community involvement, the volume of tourist visits and of course the incredible finds being made from our rich early Christian and medieval past, just a stonersquos throw from the traditional site of St Patrickrsquos grave, he said.ldquoItrsquos exciting to hear about the new discoveries that are being made and the Early Christian dates of some of the finds, and I am delighted to announce that a second season of excavation is to be funded by the Special European Union Programmes Body for this August, as part of its PEACE IV Programme, when young people between  and  will be invited to take part in the dig for at least four days. Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

The apologists for dissident republicanism held a march in the very heart of Dublin.Sinn Fein was quick on Friday to emphasise its support for the PSNI. While this is nothing less than any prospective party of government ought to be offering, it was nonetheless welcome — the alternative, a sense of ambivalence, would have been a major worsening of the political mood in NI.It is perhaps unsurprising that Mary Lou McDonald yesterday called for joint authority to be imposed in Northern Ireland. Easter is after all an iconic time for republicans, and the Sinn Fein president was hardly going to announce that her party was suddenly jettisoning its all Ireland aims.Even so, it is important that this sort of talk is stamped on. London has never properly done that, apart from junior ministers making occasional statements when pressed that they would not countenance such a thing.While it is strictly true, as Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says, that Dublin has come out against joint authority, Ireland has also made clear that London-only direct rule is unacceptable. But London-only direct rule is, or ought to be, the only substitute for Stormont,the alternative is bowing to SF blackmail. The latter course will guarantee political instability in the future.The task of change now falls to Lyra’s generation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingRat is crushed to death in N.I. restaurant -

I met him on a couple of occasions, and I think there was a strong, burning desire in his heart to preserve the best of education for all our young people.”Ulster and Ireland rugby star Rory Best tweeted: “Incredibly saddened to hear of the sudden loss of Mr Simon Harper, principal of my former school @pcportadown. Thoughts are with his family  friends.”A tribute issued on behalf of the Portadown College community said their friend and colleague was a “highly charismatic educator and leader” whose lelong passion for outdoor pursuits and Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions instilled a “love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures”.It is understood Mr Harper was on a walking holiday when he died. The cause of his death is not yet known.The school tribute added: “Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance. Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an Officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.“In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A statement issued by Rathfriland High School paid tribute to Mr Harper Simon as a man of unquestionable integrity.“Simon was a great school leader who had the needs of the pupils at the core of all he did. His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable.

Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was brought in to streamline the benefits process but has faced severe criticism and been subject to several delays.The committee report acknowledged the system is ldquolikely to stay but called for ldquofundamental urgent changes to its design, including cutting waiting times for payments and bringing in additional support for claimants. The report also called for an end to in-work sanctions, scrapping the benefits freeze, said Universal Credit is a ldquosignicant cause in the rise of food banks, and claimed the DWP made a ldquoserious error of judgment in cutting jobcentres in Scotland while rolling out the new benefit system.Conservative members of the committee, Jeremy Balfour and Michelle Ballantyne, dissented from some of the reportrsquos conclusions.The SNPrsquos Alasdair Allan, who sits on the committee, said: ldquoThis report is a stark warning from those at the front line of the fight against poverty, and yet another example of Westminsterrsquos failures ndash it confirms the disastrous impact the Toryrsquos welfare cuts and sanctions are having on vulnerable people across Scotland.ldquoItrsquos clear that Tory MSPs have their heads firmly in the sand over their Westminster colleaguesrsquo deeply harmful welfare policies.ldquoThey remain in denial over the damage this welfare system is causing, with people struggling to pay for essentials even though they have a job.ldquoThe Scottish Government is already taking action, but therersquos a limit to what we can do with one hand tied behind our back.ldquoIf the UK Government does not urgently reform the welfare system, in-work poverty will rise further, as working people transfer to Universal Credit and find themselves worse off.A DWP spokeswoman said: ldquoEmployment is at a record high, wages are outstripping inflation and income inequality and absolute poverty are lower than in . ldquoSanctions are only used in a small minority of cases and only when people donrsquot fulfil their agreed commitments to look for work.

Calling for the Scottish Government to urgently address the situation, Mr Deerin added: ldquoWe are in real danger of opening up a new type of attainment gap in Scotland ndash one where children who are allowed to sit eight or nine National s or s will have a distinct advantage over those restricted to five or six, regardless of the latterrsquos ability.ldquoThe schools cutting the number of exams on offer are typically those serving our more deprived communities, further limiting the le opportunities of children who may already be disadvantaged.Freedom of Information requests by the group revealed that, in , all schools in Edinburgh, East Dunbartonshire and Dumfries and Galloway offered eight exams now no schools in either East Dunbartonshire or Dumfries and Galloway offer eight, and the limit in Edinburgh ies between six and eight.The implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence by the Scottish Government has been blamed for the reduction in available subjects, which critics say shows the ldquohallmark of poor management.Chair of the Commission on School Reform and one of the authors of Curriculum for Excellence Keir Bloomer said: ldquoOne of the purposes of CfE was to broaden pupilsrsquo education, but instead the way in which it is being implemented is narrowing it signicantly.ldquoThere is ample opportunity for pupils to combine practical and academic options when they are enabled to sit nine, eight, or even seven exams, but when we narrow it down to six or five there is very little room for manoeuvre.ldquoReducing the number of subject options is not a government policy. It has come about by accident the unintended consequence of ill-conceived advice. This is the hallmark of poor management.ldquoThis is a lose-lose.A Scottish Government spokeswoman defended the Curriculum for Excellence, claiming it ldquoprovides signicant flexibility and allows schools to ldquohave the freedom to design a bespoke three-year senior phase of a range of courses and qualications tailored to meet the needs of the young people at the school.She added: ldquoWhat matters is the qualications and awards that pupils leave school with, and not only what they study in S.ldquoAlmost two-thirds now leave school in S, and last year a record proportion went on to positive destinations including work, training or further study.ldquoYoung people also now have opportunities to study towards a much broader range of qualications, not just at school, but also at college and through apprenticeships. Scottish Conservative shadow education secretary Liz Smith said: ldquoThis is yet further confirmation of the very serious reduction in subject choice which is affecting so many pupils across Scotland.ldquoIt is a disgrace that the SNP has allowed this situation to develop, most especially when the evidence shows it hits hardest for those in the more deprived communities where the attainment gap is already a major issue..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Curriculum for Excellence blamed for drop in exams pupils can sit article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoThe nicotine in e-cigarettes is not a harmless drug and then there all these other things such as flavourings that are inhaled.ldquoWe havenrsquot had e-cigarettes for long enough to know the true effects.ldquoBut when we look at the evidence we do have, therersquos enough grounds for serious concerns.ldquoGiven the short-term effects on lungand cardiovascular effects, there is enough evidence to say we should be very, very careful.PHE has campaigned for cigarette smokers to switch to e-cigarettes, and has said they are % less harmful than tobacco smoking ndash a figure disputed by many health experts including Prof McKee.He said PHE had failed to adequately show that e-cigarettes are an effective quitting aid and was ignoring evidence that they cause damage in their own right.He said: ldquoFirst of all, yoursquove got to show that theyrsquore safe. New products shouldnrsquot be introduced without showing that to be the case.ldquoItrsquos not whether e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes, itrsquos whether they are actually safe.ldquoThen,they are going to be demonstrated as a quitting aid, yoursquove got to demonstrate that they are really a quitting aid and that they are at least as safe as or better than other products.ldquoBut that has not been done. There is not the evidence at the population level that they are a useful quitting aid.He said PHE was turning a blind eye to increasing evidence that youngsters are trying vaping and are attracted to e-cigarette brands and marketing.A report published by PHE in February said that regular use of e-cigarettes among young people remains low. But its figures showed that the number of UK children and teenagers trying vaping has doubled in recent years.Some .% of children aged  to  reportedhaving tried vaping, according to  data, a rise from .% in .The proportion who said they had never tried e-cigarettes fell from .% in  to .% in .Prof McKee said there was ldquoa worrying trend of e-cigarettes clearly being made attractive to youngsters.ldquoIt is now very clear these products are being pushed very hard to children, he said.ldquoThis creates an entirely avoidable risk of a new generation that will be addicted to nicotine.Hewarned that youngsters could become hooked on Juul, ane-cigarette that has been blamed in the US for creating nicotine addiction in children, and which was introduced to the UK market last summer.ldquoWhy would British children be any dferent to American children in that respect , he said.Prok McKee also called for tighter regulation of the whole e-cigarette market.ldquoI think e-cigarettes should be regulated as medicines which means yoursquove got to demonstrate that they are safe and effective, he said. ldquoItrsquos as simple as that.And he attacked voluntary codes of conduct adopted by the e-cigarette industry, adding: ldquoNobody in public health should take voluntary codes of conduct at all seriously.ldquoTherersquos loads of research showing that voluntary agreements donrsquot work.He continued:ldquoTobacco firms are doing a lot of brand stretching here. They are promoting products that look very much like cigarettes with similar colours, logos and names.ldquoThe firms are trying to become socially acceptable. They have been internation pariahs and now theyrsquore trying to present themselves as part of the solution.Prof McKee said the position held by PHE wasldquountenable in the long run.He said: ldquoWe are hugely out of step with the rest of world.ldquoI think a small group of iniduals in England have been able to devote a lot of effort to take forward the agenda here.Dr Aaron Scott, from the University of Birminghamrsquos Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, has published a paper in the journal Thorax,funded by the British Lung Foundation, showing that vaporised e-liquid fluid has a similar effect on the lungs and body as seen in regular cigarette smokers.He told the Press Association: ldquoWe donrsquot know what the long-term data is but we have shown that itrsquos cytotoxic and itrsquos pro-inflammatory, just like cigarette smoke is over the short-term.He said it was dficult to get funding for long-term studies ldquobecause PHE want to push the message that theyare not harmful.He said long-term studies were needed so people could make their own decision ldquobased on national data rather than this % supposition.He added: ldquoWe only have evidence for short-term and in the short-term itrsquos definitely harmful.Dr Scott said it was understandable that PHE wanted to ldquoput out its strongest message possible that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking.But he added: ldquoI think we should be more cautious. Theyrsquove advocated for less regulation of e-cigarettes to make it easier for people to take up these devices and I donrsquot agree with that.He added: ldquoYou can go into a pound store anywhere in the country and buy e-cigarette liquid for pound.ldquoYou can do that with very little regulation, so itrsquos very easy for example for kids to get that, itrsquos very accessible.Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE, said: ldquoWhile research on e-cigarettes continues to emerge we must act on what the current evidence tells us.ldquoThere is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking.ldquoThis view is held by many across the world, including the Royal College of Physicians, Cancer Research UK, the British Medical Association and the National Academy of Sciences in the US.ldquoThere is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping.Prof Newton said PHE was ldquoalert to the risks and the UK had taken a ldquocareful approach to maximise the opportunities that e-cigarettes present to help more smokers quit.An estimated  in  patients in acute hospital beds in England are smokers. This presents a unique opportunity to offer smoking cessation advice.

principal and naval reserve officer simon harper  ","story":"An international rugby star and a former education minister are among those who have paid tribute to Portadown College principal Simon Harper who died suddenly while on holiday in Scotland.Past pupil Rory Best said he was “incredibly saddened” at the news, while Peter Weir MLA described Mr Harper as having played a “crucial role” in the Northern Ireland education system.Having taught at Rathfriland High School and Regent House in Newtownards, Mr Harper took over as principal of Portadown College in .“He played a crucial role in local education and many will join me in mourning his passing,” Mr Weir said.“I think we’d have been on a very similar page. I met him on a couple of occasions, and I think there was a strong, burning desire in his heart to preserve the best of education for all our young people.”Ulster and Ireland rugby star Rory Best tweeted: “Incredibly saddened to hear of the sudden loss of Mr Simon Harper, principal of my former school @pcportadown. Thoughts are with his family  friends.”A tribute issued on behalf of the Portadown College community said their friend and colleague was a “highly charismatic educator and leader” whose lelong passion for outdoor pursuits and Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions instilled a “love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures”.It is understood Mr Harper was on a walking holiday when he died. The cause of his death is not yet known.The school tribute added: “Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance. Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an Officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.“In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A statement issued by Rathfriland High School paid tribute to Mr Harper Simon as a man of unquestionable integrity.“Simon was a great school leader who had the needs of the pupils at the core of all he did. His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand.try catch  TrendingPortadown College principal dies suddenlyTribute paid to Portadown College

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
