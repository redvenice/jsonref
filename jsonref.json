[{"url":null,"title":"Britains self driving vehicle trials launch Milton Keynes MailOnline tests Aurrigos AutoPod","story":"Share this article Speaking on the MK:5G experiment, Digital Infrastructure Minister Julia Lopez told MailOnline: \u0027This pioneering £2 million trial will see how 5G-powered tech can improve stadium experiences.\u0027Driverless shuttles will help people and goods travel around the site, robots will help hotel guests with their luggage and deliver room service, and autonomous surveillance vehicles and drones will improve security.\u0027The scheme is all part of our £200 million programme across the UK to demonstrate and test how we can seize the opportunities of 5G to turbocharge our economy and help businesses bounce back from the pandemic.\u0027Miles explains that Milton Keynes has become an attractive destination for tech companies such as Aurrigo.The town\u0027s grid road infrastructure, which 1970s architects drew from California\u0027s urban theorist Melvin Webber and weaving footpaths that run parallel to its dual carriageways, ensures traffic flows freely and is accessible for all.\u0027The council are ever so open to innovation and as a company that makes the area a really attractive destination\u0027, he adds. That\u0027s a view shared by Milton Keynes Council\u0027s leader Pete Marland, who has been in charge of the coalition-run local authority since May. Mr Marland points to the history of innovation seen in Milton Keynes, which was home to the Bletchley Park codebreakers, and the fact automotive giants Volkswagen, Mercedes and Formula One team Red Bull Racing set up their headquarters in the town.\u0027Milton Keynes is the home of thinking differently, and these self-driving trials help to prove that. It\u0027s all helping us determine the sort of city we want to build in the future and that\u0027s an important thing for the UK as a whole,\u0027 he said.\u0027The AutoPods carry on a history of transport innovation seen in the Milton Keynes area. We had the canals, Wolverton\u0027s as the first railway town, Bletchley Park of course. We were built on the car in the 1960s and 70s, and we will continue to do so in the future.\u0027Mr Marland is also quick to point out that getting behind the wheel of a car isn\u0027t always 100 per cent safe, and is urging members of the public to try out the autonomous vehicles before passing judgement on them. \u0027Humans driving cars aren\u0027t perfectly safe. The AI has shown to be safer than human driving in semi and fully autonomous vehicles like this, it\u0027s just a matter of people catching up with that technology.\u0027Features like auto park and lane change assist are already built-in to many modern vehicles and this is just that next logical step.\u0027 According to statistics shared on Gov.uk, \u0027human error\u0027 contributes to more than 85 per cent of all accidents on Britain\u0027s roads. Brian Matthews, the Council\u0027s transport officer, anticipates the trial being expanded to other areas in the town, namely the busy railway station and the shopping centre, by the end of the year. \u0027It\u0027s so important that we use technology to help the city grow in a sustainable way that supports the quality of life for our citizens. We have a culture, I think, in Milton Keynes that sees innovation as a way forward and stretching the boundaries.\u0027Exploring driverless technology is something we want to do because there are huge potential advantages, and we need to understand what those are before we invest in them fully. \u0027Are they safer? Do they increase productivity? Reduce congestion? Most importantly for the city, do they increase mobility options for those who can\u0027t drive? These are all very important factors that we are trying to consider\u0027. I\u0027m keen to hear Brian\u0027s views on how he thinks the future of autonomous vehicles will play out, both in Milton Keynes and further afield. \u0027I don\u0027t think autonomous vehicles will be our sole future, rather it will play a part in our future\u0027, he explains.\u0027I think we already realise that it\u0027s not a one-size fits all situation and it will be a mix, and self-driving vehicles will be a part of that mix\u0027.Others have a much more optimistic view. Miles makes clear he thinks we are witnessing the start of an exciting new future for transport as a whole. \u0027Everyone in the world is currently working on autonomous vehicles. They are the future, and they will be on our roads. There\u0027s absolutely no doubt about that.\u0027 As my morning in the AutoPod wraps up I\u0027m filled with many questions. How will driverless vehicles work on many of the UK\u0027s roads that were not meticulously designed for motorists? Will the public be receptive to such huge change?Most pressingly, was my trip around the stadium actually any faster than walking? A quick search on Google suggests not - their Maps function predicts my trip would have taken less than 10 minutes on foot.  I have little doubt that this slow-moving start marks a tentative first step forward into something that could one day be a feasible option for public transport seen in both Milton Keynes and wider afield. So although my 15-minute journey in the driverless AutoPod may have been one short drive for man, only time will tell if it was yet another a giant leap for all of mankind.  Tesla Crashed in Full Self-Driving Mode, Owner Files NHTSA Report"},{"url":null,"title":"Katie Prices ex Kieran Hayler accuses party making false claims","story":"Share this articleKatie Price¿s ex-husband Kieran Hayler will be quizzed by cops over three rape allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"Nick Jonas Priyanka welcome baby girl 12 weeks early","story":"Share this article The couple both agreed it\u0027s best to focus entirely on their future child when they do become parents.She added: \u0027I\u0027m okay with that.

Once Nphet had vaccines as insurance last year, members relaxed considerably in their approach to Covid-19. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsWell, that is understandable, because we are moving into a new phase of dealing with the virus, where new rules apply. The pandemic as we have known it for two years is going to be behind us very soon. Covid-19 will still be a threat but not to the all-encompassing extent we have grown used to.Let’s start with the decision by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to approve the lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions, which is based on three key factors.The first is the existence of effective vaccines against the disease that have been taken by the vast majority of the population. Though these do not prevent transmission, they work very well to stop people getting seriously ill.Ministers are reportedly surprised at the willingness of public health officials to lift restrictions so quickly, but they shouldn’t be. Once Nphet had vaccines in their back-pocket as insurance last year, its members relaxed considerably in their approach. Yes, fresh restrictions were imposed in the second half of last year, but these were dictated primarily by the threat to a creaking health service.That has now passed. The second factor is the evidence, apparent for some weeks, that the current Omicron wave is not overwhelming hospitals. The peak of cases is behind us and all the indicators are currently pointing in the right direction.Omicron favour Thirdly, Omicron has done us all a favour by decimating the previous, more virulent Delta variant. It has also clarified the approach needed from public health officials around the globe there’s little point in trying to duck and e with Omicron, as it is so transmissible that almost everyone is going to get it.Every day, about 125 million people are getting infected with Omicron, the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has estimated. This is 10 times higher than the Delta peak last year. By the end of March, more than half the world’s population is expected to have been infected, in just four months.But how can a disease so widespread be a good thing? As many as 90 per cent of these infections will be asymptomatic people will hardly notice them but they are benefitting from increased immunity.Throughout the pandemic, IHME models have been pessimistic yet accurate, and the institute has repeatedly called for higher levels of mask-wearing to protect against the virus. Yet this is what its director Prof Christopher Murray wrote in The Lancet this week: “The transmission intensity of Omicron is so high that policy actions-eg, increasing mask use, expanding vaccination coverage in people who have not been vaccinated, or delivering third doses of Covid-19 vaccines-taken in the next weeks will have limited impact on the course of the Omicron wave.”Mask useIncreasing use of masks to 80 per cent of the population, for example, will only reduce cumulative infections over the next four months by 10 per cent, his modelling suggests. “The speed of the Omicron wave is so fast that policy actions will have little effect on its course globally in the next four to six weeks,” Murray adds.This is the new ball-game, in which the return on enforcing restrictive measures in the context of a milder illness is so diminished as to be of little value. A combination of vaccine-induced (preferable for most people, because less risky) and infection-induced immunity is protecting against Covid-19 in Ireland, and will soon do the same in many other countries whose Omicron waves have yet to peak.The World Health Organisation was not wrong to say this week that the pandemic is “nowhere near over”. Other countries will see the number of patients in hospital rise, just as Ireland did after Christmas, but this should not last very long.So what will happen now? It won’t be all plain sailing. Our case numbers may rise as people get back to mixing more freely with others and colleges re-open.New variants will pop up, and we’ll have to deal with them. Even Delta hasn’t gone away completely. BA.2, a sub-lineage of Omicron, may already be contributing to rising cases in Denmark, and will have to be watched closely.Waning immunityWaning vaccine immunity is a problem, one that could be solved in time for next winter by better vaccines. Winter 202223, when cases rise again and hospitals come under pressure, will be a challenge anyway.Covid-19 will be around for some time to bother us. We’ll be able to treat the vulnerable with antivirals and prevent them getting infected with masks and physical distancing. Improving ventilation and air quality in schools and other busy locations seems like a no-brainer. More genomic sequencing will be needed to spot AY.2 and emerging threats more quickly.Without realising it, many people have become “institutionalised” during the pandemic some will struggle with the freedoms offered as it ends. All of us will have to find the right balance that allows us to live again while feeling safe. That balance will vary hugely according to our perception of risk 20 years after the SARS outbreak, many people in Asia continued to wear masks in public places.For now, though, this phase is over. As Murray concludes, “after the Omicron wave, Covid-19 will return but the pandemic will not”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"big money in play as broadband rollout gets under way throughout state","story":"Connecting the residences of 1.1 million people, 54,000 farms and 44,000 businesses in a system that will be seen on virtually every metre of every rural road. Photograph: iStockTJ Malone points to hoops of pristine white cable hanging from telegraph posts as he drives up a narrow boreen near Blessington, Co Wicklow, with grass growing in the middle of the road.The cables are a sign that this sparsely populated rural district will soon be connected to superfast broadband: “It’s a massive task,” says Malone, who is in charge of delivering on the promises made by National Broadband Ireland, the company responsible for the project.“It gets right down into every single village, every single home and any peninsula, including the islands,” says Malone about a project that will eventually cover all the parts the State – 96 per cent of the total landmass, in fact – where subsidies are need to make broadband delivery possible.With State funding of up to €2.6 billion in play, it’s big money. Private investors have pledged €175 million and additional sums if needed that would bring the total to €223 million. So far, the investors have paid in €120 million, including€20 million of it in December.There is no shortage of critics but NBI, whose chairman is Irish-American businessman David McCourt, is confident that it can complete the job under budget.Work has begun on supplying 151,000 homes and businesses. In time, it will rise to cover 554,000 locations – connecting the residences of 1.1 million people, 54,000 farms and 44,000 businesses in a system that will be seen on virtually every metre of every rural road.Fibre-optic cables stretching for 146,000km will go overhead for 89,494km – connecting 1.47 million telegraph poles, and those cables will run underground for 15,057km. And all of this is being done with the promise that the service will be “future-proofed” for 25 years, and capable of being expanded by a quarter.Despite complaints about the pace of the rollout, work is now under way in each of the 26 counties. In Dublin, some of the vast industrial estates at Ballymount on the city’s highly-developed western edges have been included.Strange as it may seem, such locations are not deemed commercially viable by market operators, thus bringing “rural broadband” within the bounds of the M50 motorway around the capital, in sight of the Red Cow roundabout.The delivery of broadband offshore is a different challenge entirely. A symbolic moment looms in coming weeks when the NBI system goes live on in four small Atlantic islands: Collanmore, Co Mayo and the Donegal islands of Eighter, EadarinisInishcoo and Rutland.Rural depopulationIf successful, it will be the spearhead of efforts reverse generations of rural depopulation, as important in the 21st century as rural electrification was in its day, reviving sleepy towns and villages of the countryside.Rural broadband was needed before 2019. But the pandemic has changed the way people think and the rise in demand for working from home requires superfast broadband to make it a reality.“The social and economic development of rural Ireland is integral to the wellbeing of our country as a whole and to our quality of life. Ireland’s economy, heritage and culture is heavily dependent on the contribution of rural areas,” said a Government policy document last year.“The availability of high-speed broadband services in rural communities will have a transformative effect, even in the most remote parts of the country. It will ensure equality of access to online services for people in rural areas.“It will create potential for improved social cohesion and economic growth and will allow people to pursue their careers without the need to relocate, as well as offering the potential to attract new people and businesses to rural locations.”If all of that points to pressure on National Broadband Ireland to get the rollout right, the project has proved contentious. Government approval in 2019 for the came in the face of forceful resistance from the Department of Public Expenditure. The Department opposed it on grounds of cost, affordability, value-for-money and Exchequer risks and it expressed concern that the State will not own the network once it is built.In addition, TDs and Senators are unhappy with coronavirus lockdown delays that left the project six months behind schedule. More recently still, the company and the Government dismissed outright media claims that an investment hedge fund had quietly taken a majority stake in the project, insisting there was no ownership change at all.“Bringing a private company on board to actually build it was the right decision,” insists Peter Hendrick, chief executive of National Broadband Ireland.Asked about criticism that the deal is too favourable to private investors, he points to “clawbacks” that give the Government a share of any savings on construction costs and an upside share of NBI revenues above certain targets.“The protection mechanisms they have in terms of clawbacks will provide all of the comforts that actually there isn’t an unlimited win here for shareholders,” he says.“Because the tender process went on for so long there’s very little ambiguity and every single scenario has been thought of. I would say the biggest winners here are probably all the law firms.”Technical complexityIn chilly Blessington this week, workers were busily installing 571km of cable to connect 5,006 premises in the area that do not already have broadband.Although the expansive lakes nearby and the imposing Wicklow mountains in the distance make for striking scenery, they add to the technical complexity of connecting the hinterland of a bustling country town that is near enough to Dublin to be in the city commuter belt. The number of premises ranks among the largest for connection by NBI in a single area, but Midleton in Co Cork will the biggest.The work now under way in Blessington is but the final part of a project in which everything has to be worked out in advance.“You don’t know until you dig,” says Aidan McWeeney, a national broadband worker who seems to know every single manhole in the Blessington area. “These are areas that haven’t been touched in decades unless there was a damaged cable. So it’s a huge unknown.”The planning includes route maps into inidual homes and schedules for tree-clipping to make way for cables overhead. The need for detailed records means that each tree is photographed, before and after the cuts, meaning NBI has thousands of pictures of trees on file.All told, surveyors examined more than 20,000 Blessington “assets” before any construction work started on the ground. The aim was to set out what exactly needed to be done at each site, quantify the materials required, identify any environmentally or archaeologically sensitive sites and ascertain the wayleaves and consents needed to traverse private and public property.It turns out that numerous homes in the area could not be connected without an agreement with the ESB to run cable along a bridge it owns near Poulaphouca reservoir. “Until we get access there we can’t finish out the 1,000 premises we need to do. Most of work will be done to it and it’s a case of just getting that done,” Malone says.Similar consents were required from CIÉ for 600 rail crossings around the State. Work cannot be done on national roads without the approval of Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the consent of local authorities is needed to work on other roads. That can take up to 12 weeks, eating further into precious time.Then there is the unpredictable. In spite of all the effort to start installing cable in Blessington, someone took a chainsaw to a row of six poles on one roadway. The matter is with the Garda.Progress has also been hampered by procedural “teething” problems. Malone tells how, in the early days of the project, NBI encountered a rejection rate “in the region of 40 per cent” when applying to some local authorities for licences to erect inidual telegraph poles. That “tortuous” system has since been streamlined, but it took practically a year to establish new guidelines to speed the process and boost predictability.“You pick up these learnings in the first year-and-a-half of a project,” he adds, arguing that the tricky groundwork done in the early enables the project to “snowball” as momentum builds later. “We spent two years to get 37,000 premises built and in the next three months we’ll get another 25,000 built.”The aim by the end of this year is to have the build completed at 127,000 premises, with the build commenced on 220,505 premises, and surveys complete for more than 380,000 premises.Making up for lost groundA couple years into the project, NBI is now in a race to make up ground lost during the first lockdown.The closure of hotels and other services interrupted NBI’s ability to carry out physical surveys of remote townlands, or to examine poles and cables. Only then could it be established what remedial work and new network infrastructure was required.The disruption was like heavy snowfall, says Malone, very real, but very quickly forgotten by those demanding faster action: “In the early stages of this we had guys who were travelling all around the country who had to go home at night. Then you had contractors who weren’t mobilised because they couldn’t get even facilities for somebody on the road to go to the loo. It’s as simple as that.”NBI has not been hit with financial penalties for missing targets, thanks to “reliefs” for the impact of communicable diseases. When the contract was drawn up, the fear was that something like foot-and-mouth could occur. Nobody then thought, or knew anything about, a pandemic such as Covid-19.But with coronavirus still not beaten and many broadband contractors absent this month because of omicron close contacts, the upshot of it all is that NBI now finds itself without any time to lose. Still, Hendrick insists the job can still be finished by its original 2026 deadline.After the Government pressed last year to accelerate the project, could the job yet be done by 2025? “We still have a chance,” Hendrick replies. “We’ll get it in on seven years if we’re aiming for something less and our objective is to aim for six.”There’s promotions happening now. So we would see the take-up being considerably higher than where we would have thought it was a couple of years ago.”But there are mountains still to climb. As of January 7th, the grand total of premises using the NBI service was 5,122. That number will have to grow and grow and grow for years to come.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lifting covid restrictions what can i do on saturday that i haven t been able to do","story":"Publican Dan McGrattan of McGrattan’s on Fitzwilliam Lane, Dublin watches as  Taoiseach Micheál Martin announces the end to Covid-19 restrictions.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced the lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions telling the Irish people they responded when hit by an unprecedented health emergency saying: “You did what you were asked to do.” He acknowledged there has been grief at the loss of life but said the public’s “collective efforts have saved thousands of lives”. Having spoken to the Irish people on “many dark days” he said “today is a good day”.Mr Martin said Ireland has “weathered the Omicron storm” with the rate of infections now reducing and key indicators having stabilised and going in right direction.The vaccine programme has “utterly transformed our situation” and the rationale and justification for continuing most of the public health restrictions are no longer there, he said.“Spring is coming and I don’t know if I have ever looked forward to one as much as this one. Humans are social beings and we Irish are more social than most. As we look forward to this spring, we need to see each other again, we need to see each other smile, we need to sing again.”At the start of his speech Mr Martin noted that on this day in 1919 the first Dáil met and formally declared the country’s independence.“As we face into our second century as a free democracy, and as we navigate this new phase of Covid, it is time to be ourselves again,” he said. Mr Martin’s address to the nation came after the Cabinet agreed to lift almost all Covid-19 restrictions from 6am on Saturday. Household visits will be permitted with no restrictions, the early closing time for hospitality and events will be scrapped, as will capacity restrictions for outdoor events and indoor events, including weddings. The same is true for many protective measures including requirements for physical distancing, seated only indoor tables, pods of six for activities, the Covid pass requirement for all venues and activities, and the requirement to maintain contact details. Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen and a phased return to the office will begin from Monday. Mr Martin said the recovery of Ireland’s society and economy “is already underway and we will continue to do what is necessary to support it.”The Cabinet had decided to continue and extend the provision of a number of supports, highlighting the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, he said. Mr Martin also said the Government will work with colleagues at a European and International level “to ensure the rapid deployment of vaccines and therapeutics across Africa and the developing world”. “None of us will be fully safe until we are all safe.”“There is much to do” he continued. “But today is a good day, and we should all take a moment to appreciate how far we’ve come to appreciate the effort and sacrifice of those who put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe to remember and appreciate the lives and contribution of those we lost.”He said the news will be welcomed by many but he is conscious that some people will feel anxiety about re-engaging with others. “For those who do feel like that, I’d ask you to be open about it, share it. “We all need to be open with each other, be supportive of each other. Travel and mask wearingMask wearing will still be required in all settings where it is currently regulated for until February 28th, with protective measures in schools and childcare facilities remaining until that date. Mr Martin said that because of the international situation there are no changes to the current measures in place for travel. He said the advice for those with symptoms, positive cases and close contacts remains in place. The remaining measures will be reviewed by the end of February by which time all children aged between 5 and 11 will have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. Mr Martin urged parents to engage with their GPs about the vaccines saying they are safe for children.More broadly he said the unvaccinated and unboosted suffer the most from the virus and he urged people who haven’t had the jabs to get them.He said: “The pandemic isn’t over. It will still require all of us to be vigilant The changes we are making will likely lead to a temporary rise in infections in the short term but we are advised that the impact of this rise will be limited by the scale of vaccination in the population.”Mr Martin said: “I can’t promise you there won’t be further twists in this pandemic requiring different decisions in the future but I do know this.“Solidarity in each other and trust in science has got us to where we are today and will get us through whatever else this virus may throw at us.”He said the Government’s job is to prepare for any future wave of the disease and hospital and ICU capacity will continue to be expanded.Business supportsAt a press conference on Friday evening, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said people can look forward cautiously to “a spring and summer of freedom”.He said the there will be “bumps in the road ahead” but also “confidence if this is not the end it’s the beginning of the end”.Mr Varadkar, the Minister for Enterprise, said workers and businesses “have been to hell and back” and while restrictions end tomorrow the supports will not.He said the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will not be phased out fully until April 5th and this will allow more time for 80,000 people still getting the payment to get their jobs back or find new ones.The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) payments to employers will reduce for sectors not impacted by the most recent restrictions until they’re stopped on April 30th.For hospitality and live entertainment businesses affected by the 8pm curfew EWSS will continue at the higher rate for an extra month until the end of February before being reduced and stopping altogether on May 31st.Mr Varadkar said there will be no cliff edge but there will have to be an end to the payments. Minister for Culture and Tourism Catherine Martin said there have been many lost days and weeks “and worse we have lost loved ones”.However, she said that as a result of the changes announced on Friday young people can go out and meet friends again, can play music, can dance and cheer on their favourite sports team again.She said there will be a return to full stadiums.Ms Martin confirmed that there will be a St Patrick’s Day parade in Dublin this year and there is €2 million in funding for it. She said that some nightclubs will “unfortunately” not be able to reopen until Wednesday as they will have to go through the process of getting their special exemption orders under licensing laws from the District Court. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “It is important to say the pandemic itself is not over”.He said there is still a high number of cases and vigilance must remain for variants of concern. Mr Holohan said there may be an increase in case numbers as a result of the changes – particularly among school-going children.He said such increases have been seen in other countries but this was taken into account in the advice the National Health emergency Team gave to Government. Mr Martin was asked if hand-shakes are back.He replied: “If you’re comfortable and if you feel safe shaking someone’s hand, yes.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency is over taoiseach confirms snap removal of most covid 19 measures","story":"The lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions was announced by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, starting  from 6am this weekend. Video: RTETaoiseach Micheál Martin: ‘Spring is coming and I don’t know if I have ever looked forward to one as much as this one.’ Photograph: Julien BehalAfter almost two years of restrictions to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus, social and economic life begins to return to normal today after the Government confirmed last night it would quickly remove most pandemic measures.In a televised address from Government Buildings last night, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that while he had often delivered bad news from there in the past, “today is a good day”.Earlier, at a special Cabinet meeting, Ministers agreed to immediately apply advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) which had told the Government there was no longer a public health rationale for the continuation of most restrictions.From 6am this morning, the great majority of public health restrictions will be discontinued. Pubs and restaurants will be able to return to normal opening hours today, while nightclubs will be permitted to open tonight, though most will need to obtain a late licence from the courts and will not open until Wednesday. The rules limiting attendances at all indoor and outdoor events are discontinued, meaning that major sporting events will proceed with full capacity. The requirement for digital Covid certificates is also gone. A phased return to the office will begin on Monday.However, some rules will remain in place. Mask wearing will still be required in all settings where it is currently enforced until February 28th. There are no changes to the current measures in place for travel, while the advice for those with symptoms, positive cases and close contacts remains in place. The remaining measures will be reviewed by the end of February.At an upbeat press conference following his televised address Mr Martin said: “Spring is coming and I don’t know if I have ever looked forward to one as much as this one . . . As we look forward to this spring, we need to see each other again.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar announced a number of changes to the business and worker supports, culminating in their phasing out in the first half of the year.A planned reduction in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme payments to employers will be postponed until March but the support will be wound down gradually after that. The pandemic unemployment payment will be closed for new applicants today and phased out over the next two months. Mr Varadkar said there will be “no cliff edge” but there will have to be an end to the payments.He also said that workers who do not wish to return to the office have no automatic right to remain working at home. “If your contract of employment says that you are required to work in a particular location, then that’s your contractual obligation,” he said. Minister for Arts Catherine Martin said there will be a St Patrick’s Day parade in Dublin this year and there is €2 million in funding for it. Both the Taoiseach and State chief medical officer Tony Holohan stressed the pandemic was “not over”. However, asked if the public health emergency was over, Mr Martin replied “yes, the emergency is over in terms of those restrictions”. He said that the Government would seek to “embed into the health system” the capacity to deal with future outbreaks or new variants. What if you have symptoms?Dr Holohan said an increase in case numbers could be expected as restrictions are lifted, a trend that he said had been seen in other countries. But he said that Nphet had “dialled that in in the advice we have given to Government”. He stressed the “critical importance of staying out of circulation when you have symptoms”.There will not be another meeting of Nphet for another four weeks, he said. Some senior public health figures agree the time may be coming to move away from the Nphet structure – to “thank people for their efforts”, said one , with the return to the workplace an “ideal time for that”.Mr Martin was careful to warn that “we may have to come back again” with further restrictions if new variants emerge or the situation deteriorates but the mood in Government Buildings suggested that Ministers believe the era of onerous restrictions is now finished. Hospitality businesses greeted the news with enthusiasm. The Vintners’ Federation of Ireland (VFI), which represents pubs outside Dublin, said that “pubs can get back to the business of what they do best – serving the public in a warm, safe and friendly environment”. “The removal of all restrictions this weekend is the green light for pubs to get back to doing what they do best and I know for a fact they can’t wait,” said VFI chief executive Pádraig Cribben.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord taoiseach full of the joys of spring as omicron storm passes","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste  Leo Varadkar: Will Micheál sing a Meat Loaf song? He won’t do that. Photograph: Julien Behal.No more misery monologues for the foreseeable.It’s been one setback after another for Micheál Martin. But now, finally, he’s caught a break. Out through the gap at long, long last.We thought he was going to cry.In his first good news address to the nation since taking office in the middle of a pandemic, a mightily relieved Taoiseach stood at the doors of Government Buildings and declared a new Independence Day for Ireland. The timing was felicitous, falling exactly 103 years to the day in 1919 when the first Dáil met and declared the fledgling nation’s independence.“Spring is coming and I don’t know if I have ever looked forward to one as much as I am looking forward to this one,” he said from his familiar spot at the foot of the steps. “We need to see each other again, we need to see each other smile, we need to sing again.”It must have been such a welcome change from the usual Friday night dampeners with their promises of better things to come sinking in the infectious gloom of further restrictions and impositions. And while Micheál’s deep sigh as he prepared to speak indicated a weight lifting off his shoulders, the strain of trying to keep the show on the road for so long was apparent too.“You responded, you did what you had to do,” he told the people. “We have weathered the Omicron storm.”Liberty at last.And the entire country exhaled with him.Sing, did he say?He didn’t. Not even a few bars of De Banks.There was disappointment when he didn’t even throw in a quote from Meat Loaf. (Leo Varadkar would have.)But it was a minor quibble. And when Micheál’s voice quivered as he spoke of the loved ones who died in the past two, difficult, years, who could blame him? Or when his eyes watered when he talked of spring and all the good things to come, he wasn’t the only person feeling a little emotional.At the press conference afterwards, the mood had considerably lightened. The announcement made and the reawakening underway.Tony Holohan said he plans to go to a couple of concerts and GAA matches.Leo Varadkar has no plans to go clubbing over the weekend but he’ll chance “a quiet pint on Sunday. See how it goes.”As for work, he’ll be looking forward to meeting all those new members of staff he has only encountered on virtual meetings. “It’s always interesting to find out who’s tall and who’s short.”The Taoiseach is probably going to head off to Kerry, probably to take in a match in Killarney.He won’t be going mad either. “I’ll have a pint over the weekend.”Just to toast Independence Day.Wicklow’s lesser-spotted MinisterOne year on and poor Stephen Donnelly still isn’t feeling the love on his own department’s Twitter famine, sorry, feed.Do they not know who he is?Most disappointing. Not least because yer man Simon Harris, that other Minister from Wicklow, used to get loads of mentions when he was in charge at Health.Last January, alarm bells went off at the highest level in Baggot Street when it emerged that Simon’s successor was not getting similar recognition. Obviously something needed to be done at the very highest level to address the Minister’s attention deficit problem as quickly as possible. We were, after all, in the middle of a pandemic.Donnelly’s terrible predicament came to light in April when our Public Affairs Correspondent Simon Carswell revealed that such was the concern over the shock results of analysis carried out by the Minister’s media adviser, Páraic Gallagher, it even reached the desk of secretary general Robert Watt. He wasted no time getting in touch with the department’s head of communications, Deirdre Watters.“The Minister completed an analysis of the department’s Twitter feed. There is no reference to the Minister, as you can see. We need to discuss,” he told Ms Watters in an email dated January 14th. Apparently the fear within Donnelly’s inner sanctum was that the Department of Health’s Twitter account was more Nphet-centred than Donnelly-driven, with far more mentions for Tony Holohan’s public health monitoring team than there were for Donnelly’s doings.Has this top-level intervention worked at all for the overlooked Minister?Well, despite all the attention and some awkward questions at the time for Donnelly in a Morning Ireland interview, further analysis by media research company Onclusive (formerly Kantar) shows that matters have not improved for him since then.We’ve had a look at the stats.An analysis of tweets on the Twitter accounts of Government departments since the controversy until the end of last year shows that Donnelly remains the Coalition’s lesser-spotted Minister.He was mentioned in just 11 per cent of the department’s tweets between April and December. Despite his department’s best efforts, tweeting less overall but doubling the number of times it mentioned him, Donnelly was still bottom of the pile amongst his Cabinet peers. The Department of Finance may have tweeted the least of all the departments but at least it knew how to shine a spotlight, with Paschal Donohoe emerging as the Minister most mentioned in departmental tweets with a 52 per cent strike rate.For 2021 as a whole, the strongest performer was arguably Simon Harris. With 506 mentions, spread across 200 days, the Department of Further and Higher Education mentioned him more than every other day. Funny that: Harris was the Minister Donnelly was compared against in the original analysis shared within the Department of Health.When it comes to tweeting, it seems Stephen still has a lot to learn from his constituency rival in Wicklow.All back to my HouseWith restrictions lifting , there is no truth in the rumour that Shane Ross, Finian McGrath, John Halligan and Kevin “Boxer” Moran are camping outside the gates of Leinster House in anticipation of a full reopening of facilities for former members of the Dáil next week. But, rather like the queues outside department stores before the January sales, visions of the former Independent Alliance amigos storming the members’ bar as soon as the doors are opened cannot be discounted.While the Oireachtas has yet to pronounce on revised arrangements for Leinster House, stools will be back in the Dáil bar on Monday while the catering staff are gearing up for an expected onslaught of first-time TDs and Senators when normal business resumes in the Members’ Restaurant.The Class of 2020 never got the chance to parade proud mammies and grannies around their new place of work, treating them to drinks in the Dáil bar and a slap-up meal in the VIP restaurant. As fully fledged parliamentarians – it’s a major achievement for politicians of any stripe – they haven’t been able to bring family, friends and supporters into Leinster House. It’s a special occasion for the newbies and one they have yet to enjoy.This also raises the question of vouchers. Many Oireachtas members buy them for meals in the Oireachtas restaurant which they then donate as raffle prizes. An awful lot of “dinner for four with deputy so-and-so in Leinster House” prizes are knocking about the place now and they will have to be honoured.TDs and Senators are waiting with bated breath for the green light to bring back their beloved school tours and Active Age (voters’) groups. God be with the days of the mineral and pink schnack for the school pupils and a roast lunch in the self-service canteen for confirmed voters.The transition year students and interns are also itching to get back.But the reopening of the campus to former members and the general public will see one source of irritation returning to annoy all but one of the main parties.Tour groups are always sooo excited when they encounter the Healy-Raes andor Mary Lou McDonald.It drives the others nuts.Ireland’s matron saintThe Dáil and Seanad returned from the Christmas and New Year recess this week with the formal announcement from Government of a new public holiday in honour of St Brigid. Not before time – we now have a Biddy’s Day in February to go with a Paddy’s Day in March.She said Brigid’s values of equality, 1,500 years later, are still strong. “She was the very first feminist in this country and cared deeply for those who were downtrodden by society. She looked after both women and men equally and cared deeply for the environment, for the farming community and for the animal kingdom.”Fiona mentioned that Kildare has a special relationship with Brigid and said that the first thing she did when elected mayor of the county “was to put a bog oak St Brigid’s cross in the chamber, where it still is and of which I am very proud. So it’s very much appreciated by the people of Kildare and, I have no doubt, by the people of Ireland.”They probably appreciated the announcement too.But Senator O’Loughlin had competition from her party colleague Erin McGreehan, who welcomed the news as not just “a day of celebration for mná na hÉireann” but also one for the Wee County. St Brigid, she reminded the Seanad, was a Louth woman, born over the road in Faughart.“Remember that this woman, she gouged out her eyes to make herself ugly because she didn’t want unwanted attention from men. So that on the day that we remember St Brigid and we revel in her strength and her mightiness and how proud we are to have her as our patron saint, remember what she did to get rid of unwanted attention from men,” said Erin.“I applaud her, although I don’t agree with it. But that’s what she did in the fifth century. So g’wan, Bríd!”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain must stand firm against russian aggression","story":"When the Soviet Union collapsed, Britain, Russia and the United States made a solemn agreement with Ukraine. In exchange for giving up its inheritance of the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, Ukraine’s security was to be guaranteed and its independence would be respected.Ukraine has kept its end of the deal. Vladimir Putin has not. Russia has annexed Crimea, provided support for separatist conflict in Donbas and massed 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. In doing so, it has committed repeated acts of aggression, provocation and interference.It is not enough for Western politicians to talk about the importance of our values. When they are tested, we must support our allies. Not only does Labour understand the threat posed by Putin’s Russia, we stand resolute in our support of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. I made that clear to the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK this week.The situation on the Ukrainian border is an attempt by Putin to re-establish Russian force as a means of dominance over parts of Europe. And it is a direct threat to the anti-imperialist principle that sovereign nations are free to choose their own allies and their own way of life. That is why it is crucial that parties in Westminster are united in opposing Russian aggression. I’ve been critical of the chaos at the heart of the UK Government. But I must commend the work of the Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, on this matter. He has worked hard to bring people together, written with moral clarity on the nature of Russian aggression and ensured that the UK continues to support Ukraine\u0027s ability to defend itself through military aid. These bilateral measures are important but if we are serious about repelling the Russian threat we will need a more united approach on an international level. This is where I believe the Government must step up and lead. Divisions within Nato have emboldened Putin. For too long the implicit message to Moscow has been that Putin can do what he likes and the West will do little to retaliate. We must continue to explore diplomatic routes to avoid conflict. But Russian demands that Ukraine give up its desires to join Nato and the EU should not be entertained. Nobody envisages British and allied troops being dragged into war. But we need to work with allies to use our collective resources, including sanctions, to show Russia the actions it takes will have consequences. For Britain and our allies this will mean taking tough decisions. Europe’s over-reliance on Russian energy supplies must be addressed. And here in Britain there has been a failure to rid our economic and political systems of the money used to fund and support the Putin regime. We cannot go on being the world’s laundromat for illicit finance. First, we must lift the veil on the true nature of ownership of property and other assets in the UK. That requires a registration of overseas entities bill. Second, we need reform of Companies House. There is no reason for ownership to be hidden behind layer after layer of shell companies whose only purpose is to obscure the facts from public view. Third, the Government must act on the recommendations in the intelligence and security committee’s Russia report. That means dealing with shortcomings in the unexplained wealth order regime and for a register of members of the Lords or Commons who serve on the boards of overseas companies.Fourth, we must ensure that the elections bill going through parliament requires political donations to be transparent, and to come from money generated in a legitimate fashion. To reinforce all this, Labour has announced the formation of an illicit finance taskforce with the aim of making the UK the most difficult place to launder money.Labour is proud of our internationalism. We are proud of our role in creating Nato. To continue to protect our values and our security we must be steadfast in our opposition to Russian aggression. We must stand with our Ukrainian allies and defend their right to independence. And we must get our own house in order by playing our part in ridding the West of its dependence on the loot of Russian kleptocracy.Keir Starmer is Leader of the Labour PartyMore from NewsBurials lay the groundwork for St Helena’s future as hub for ‘slavery tourism’Two men in Ireland took body of dead man into post office to claim his pensionScientists unite to stop Imperial College cancelling biologist Thomas HuxleySaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Is the four-day week too good to be true?The con artist \u0026#39lawyer\u0026#39 who faked his way to the top – and duped the worldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church england could take softly softly approach relaxing rules","story":"Churches are set to find it easier to add cushions to pews as officials aim to relax rules on adding soft furnishings in order to meet environmental targets.Under plans due to be voted on at the General Synod, new church laws will change to make it easier for vicars and parishioners wanting to add cushions, kneelers and carpets to their churches.Previously, permission for such changes would have required a full faculty – the Church\u0027s version of planning permission – but the proposals would amend the rules so it is not required in all cases.They are being put forward by officials as part of the Church\u0027s target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2030, and form part of a package of legislation that will be voted on next month. If passed, the changes will be rubber-stamped in July.Church officials claim relaxing the rules would mean buildings can more easily retain heat and therefore reduce their heating bills.Vicars, parishioners and petitioners who want to make major changes to church buildings have to submit an application to the Consistory Court – the Church\u0027s own court – of which there is one in each of the 44 dioceses overseen by a chancellor.While the proposed changes may appear minor, campaign groups can oppose them and provide written submissions calling for the preservation of historic pews and other cosmetic aspects of churches.Debates about changes to historic pews, and even the colours of cushions, have also resulted in rows between traditionalists and reformers.Documents released on Friday as part of the Church\u0027s green strategy propose that changes to kneelers, hassocks, pew runners or cushions are permitted so long as they do not result in a major change to the overall appearance. Cushions were previously only able to be introduced without permission if they did not result in a change to overall appearance.Becky Clark, the Church\u0027s director of churches and cathedrals, said trying to heat such big buildings is always a problem and admitted that the introduction of soft furnishings can be quite controversial.In churches, stone or wooden benches or hard seating can be a factor in people feeling cold because, when you sit on them, the heat in your body goes out into that material, she said.Putting cushions on seats, putting rugs on benches or small floor runners underneath pews or seating can help stop people feeling cold and you can reduce the heating.Joe O’Donnell, the director of the Victorian Society, said it was important that listed churches fully understand the significance of their building and its furnishings and that any changes do not lose what is special and nationally important about them.Diana Evans, the head of places of worship strategy at Historic England, added that all proposals should consider both environmental and heritage significance.More from NewsBurials lay the groundwork for St Helena’s future as hub for ‘slavery tourism’Two men in Ireland took body of dead man into post office to claim his pensionScientists unite to stop Imperial College cancelling biologist Thomas HuxleySaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Is the four-day week too good to be true?The con artist \u0026#39lawyer\u0026#39 who faked his way to the top – and duped the worldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"physicists crack wordle code may not spell end fun","story":"There are many approaches to solving a Wordle game. Some players of the wildly popular word-guessing game start with whichever five-letter word first comes into their head. Others make tactical use of words containing common letters.A small number of Wordle fans, however, have found another route to the answers – but are respecting the game’s “code of silence” by keeping the solutions private. Two computing experts who met at the University of Cambridge are among those to have discovered that the code underpinning the Wordle webpage contains each day’s solution, from “cigar” on June 19, 2021, to … well, that would be telling.Dr Ramsey Faragher, a bye-fellow at Queen’s College and the founder of a tech company that specialises in smartphone positioning, tipped off his friend and former student Dr Sam Gregson, a former Large Hadron Collider physicist who is now a comedian and science commentator. As Dr Faragher predicted, Dr Gregson found the list of answers within the webpage’s source code.“It certainly seems to be the case that there is an informal code of silence and a great deal of community spirit in the Wordle community,” Dr Gregson said. “Few seem to want to share or broadcast the readily available answers and those that do are met with gentle hostility or eye-rolling silence.”Dr Gregson, 38, is using the information he and Dr Faragher, 39, have unearthed to craft an analysis of optimal Wordle strategy for his video channel, The Bad Boy of Science. Bad boy though he may be, Dr Gregson does not wish to crimp others’ enjoyment of the game. As such, he is cagey about publicly revealing the list of answers.Appropriately for a game whose integrity is so highly valued, Wordle has innocent origins. Designed by Welsh-born software engineer Josh Wardle to entertain his puzzle-loving wife, Wordle was a simple online game whose players – the two of them – sought to guess a five-letter word in six attempts.Then it went viral. Having had 90 players on November 1 last year, Wordle reached 2.7 million last week. Along the way, many of its players began to use mathematics to devise the most effective opening plays possible, with little-known words such as “roate” – an obsolete variant of “rote” – catapulted back into the English lexicon.The informal omerta has not been universally observed. Jill Sutcliffe, a moderator on a large Facebook group of Wordle aficionados, says that upcoming answers have been posted on two occasions. Mrs Sutcliffe, a retired courts worker who lives in Fife, swiftly deleted the offending posts, saving the group’s 9000-odd members from having their daily Wordle session ruined. “It was awful,” she said, “because once you see the answers you can’t unsee them. But mostly people are respectful.”The  has verified the list but will not spoil the game by revealing the answers. Should you doubt Drs Gregson and Faragher, though, check Sunday’s answer against an unusual five-letter word, beginning with C, used earlier in this article.More from NewsBurials lay the groundwork

treatment plants are overwhelmed, with more than half unable to cope with demand from local homes and business, analysis shows.Of the 90 sewage works in the upper Thames, 46 don’t have enough capacity to deal with demand from local homes and businesses, a report has found.The Oxford Rivers Improvement Campaign (ORIC) analysed data supplied by Thames Water to work out how much sewage its treatment works could process and whether it was enough to handle demand from local homes and businesses.They said the data showed that the company’s failure to invest in upgrading its systems over recent decades was the cause of sewage leaks which has left the river polluted for wildlife, swimmers and rowers.Thames Water is among water companies that have come under fire in recent months for dumping untreated sewage into rivers and the sea thousands of times.It came as a video released by the BBC appeared to show sewage coming out of a pipe at Cassington sewage works, one of those covered by the study.ORIC data suggest Cassington has 74 per cent of the capacity it needs to process sewage correctly.A spokesman for Thames Water said the plant had not released untreated sewage since March last year.“Any problem seems to be occurring in the long pipe that takes the treated effluent to the river.“We are determined to understand what is coming out of the final effluent pipe and we have taken further samples as part of our examination,” she said.Not one of Britain’s rivers passes chemical pollution standards, and this week Britain’s only designated river swimming spot, in Ilkley, Yorkshire, was classified as “poor” after water quality tests showed it is heavily polluted with bacteria.British sewage systems are designed to discharge untreated sewage into rivers and the sea when the volume becomes too great for them to process.This is only supposed to happen at times of exceptionally heavy rainfall, but the analysis suggests that some of the treatment plants are also unable to cope with normal or dry weather.The group’s analysis, seen by the , shows that Oxford’s sewage treatment works had 61 per cent of the capacity it needs, while Swindon’s had 86 per cent and Banbury’s had just 43 per cent.Mark Hull, a former water industry consultant and co-author of the report, said: “Our detailed modelling shows that half the sewage works in the upper Thames do not have enough capacity they are not fit for purpose.“We believe this is typical of the whole river Thames, and indeed many if not most rivers in England.“Thames Water has taken customers’ money for treating our sewage, but not invested nearly enough to keep pace with the growth of housing.“Our rivers have returned to being open sewers and sewage treatment works.”A typical upper Thames sewage treatment works “discharges untreated sewage for around 500 hours a year”, the report says.“The rises in demand were predicted twenty years ago and should have been taken into account in water companies’ investment plans for this century,” it adds.A spokesman for Thames Water said: “We regard all discharges of untreated sewage as unacceptable and will work with the Government, Ofwat and the Environment Agency to accelerate work to stop them being necessary.“We have an unprecedented amount of investment directed towards safeguarding our rivers and streams.“Between 2020 and 2025 we are spending £1.25 billion on maintaining and improving our operational sites, including contributing to the health of 745km of rivers across London and the Thames Valley.“We’re increasing sewage treatment capacity at our sewage works in the area, including Oxford, Witney, Fairford and Ampney St Peter, and we’re also committed to continuing our industry-leading trial to provide real-time alerts of sewage discharges around Oxford in 2022.”More from NewsBurials lay the groundwork for St Helena’s future as hub for ‘slavery tourism’Two men in Ireland took body of dead man into post office

We might kid ourselves that Ukraine is a long way away, but that’s exactly what people said about Czechoslovakia in 1938. Time to get real.Here’s what we’re up against, and it’s chilling. Putin has declared the breakup of the Soviet Union to be the greatest disaster of the 20th century. And he’s clearly determined to see that put right, with the subjugation of Ukraine the first step.  Already, by pouncing on Crimea, he’s seized over 7 per cent of Ukraine’s territory, shrugging off sanctions. Does anyone seriously think that’s where his ambitions end?We can be sure the people of Ukraine won\u0027t take a Russian invasion lying down. Anyone whose visited Ukraine to speak to its political leaders in recent years, and I’ve had that privilege on several occasions, will know that Ukrainians will fight to the last to defend their country. In a recent poll, 30 per cent of Ukrainians said they would take up arms to fight. That’s a staggering 13 million people. And many millions more will resist in other ways. We will fight to the last bullet and last drop of blood, said one battle-hardened soldier on the frontline of the frozen war in Ukraine\u0027s East.Putin’s forces may be superior, but if he thinks the tanks can just roll into Kyiv, he’ll be much mistaken. There is no such thing, as Joe Biden mistakenly suggested, as a minor ‘incursion’ into sovereign territory. It will be bloody and brutal. Tens of thousands of lives will surely be lost, many of them Russian.Which brings us to the EU. What the hell is it playing at? In umming and ahing about whether a confrontation will weaken inidual member economies, the organisation is putting its own selfish interests ahead of what’s right. President Macron says Europe must open its own dialogue with Russia, separate from America’s and NATO’s. This is precisely what Putin craves: a ided, disunited West. And what on earth is Macron’s idea of a “security and stability pact” between Russia and the EU? If that isn’t appeasement, I don’t know what is, and it leaves the Ukrainians rightly afraid that their future might be decided without their own say. It’s all too redolent of great powers treating countries like pawns on a chess board.Anyone with an ounce of knowledge about Putin and the Kremlin knows full well that Russia only respects strength. Weasel words and lily-livered compromise will be a red rag to the Russian bull. Anything less than complete Western unity will be fatal for Ukraine, and terrifying for other countries close to Russia’s self-styled ‘near abroad’, from Finland in the north to Georgia in the south.Thank goodness Britain knows better, and Ukraine sees us as one of its closest friends – a country that punches well above its weight in Kyiv in terms of influence and power. Already, the UK has sent new weapons system to Ukraine, and troops to provide training, in marked contrast to Germany, which refuses to do any such thing. Ukraine doesn’t expect British and American troops on the ground. As her Minister of Defence, Oleksiy Reznikov said, “Just give us the weapons we need to defend ourselves, we will do our own fighting”.This isn’t just about Ukraine, but about democracy, sovereignty, the right of people to determine their own future without being bullied and then subjugated. In short, it’s about freedom – something that 40 million Ukrainians have learned to love, and which the West is privileged enough to take for granted. Britain and America realise this. Others appear not to. Time is running out for the EU to stay on the right side of history.More from NewsBurials lay the groundwork for St Helena’s future as hub for ‘slavery tourism’Two men in Ireland took body of dead man into post office to claim his pensionScientists unite to stop Imperial College cancelling biologist Thomas HuxleySaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Is the four-day week too good to be true?The con artist \u0026#39lawyer\u0026#39 who faked his way to the top – and duped the worldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four day week good true","story":"Of all the things Henry Ford gave the world, it’s surely the most lasting – and quite possibly the reason you have time to read this today. In the 1920s, Ford decided to change the work model in his factories from a six-day, 48-hour week to a 40-hour, five-day model.He reasoned that it would let his workers properly rest, reduce injuries and errors, and give them more time to spend cash on consumer goods during the Great Depression. It did. And as you can tell by the number of Transit vans you pass every day, it wasn’t exactly a disaster for Ford’s productivity either.A similar thing happened a decade later at John Boot’s Nottingham factory. To cut surplus and increase efficiency, he switched to a five-day model with no reduction in pay. Workers turned up refreshed, and the production line ran like a dream.On either side of the Atlantic, and soon all over the world, a new working week became established: the Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. What a way to make a living.Now, after a century of going relatively unchallenged, there is a bubbling movement to update five days to four – with no attendant salary cut because, so the theory goes, productivity should be just as high, if not higher.This week, a six-month trial of the four-day week was announced in the UK, with 40 companies – from Morrisons and Unilever to charities and software developers – taking part from June to December and reporting findings to the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.It aims to take a serious look at whether we could all work better (and cut emissions, reduce stress and sick days, and save jobs) by working less. Time will tell whether it will be revealed as flawed, pie-in-the-sky nonsense that wouldn’t suit half the working population, or so blindingly convincing that we’ll all wonder why we didn’t bin the five-day model years ago.Watching closely (and bullishly confident it will be the latter) is a couple some 11,000 miles away in a penthouse apartment in Auckland. Together, Andrew Barnes and Charlotte Lockhart run 4 Day Week Global, a not-for-profit campaign to encourage the world to move to the shorter working model – and they won’t rest until we’re all resting three days a week.It is 5.30am in Auckland when I speak to them, but they’re used to early starts. “This is the problem with living in paradise…” Lockhart, 53, says over Zoom.The pair organise pilot programmes all over the globe, including the one that started here this week, and are in such demand they have no hope of working a four-day week themselves, says Barnes, 61. “But there we are…”He is confident the UK trial will go well, especially since polls suggest three-quarters of British people back a four-day week. We’re far from the first to give it a go, however. Last summer, results from a pair of trials in Iceland prompted gushing headlines about what an “overwhelming success” it was.And for some it really was – 86 per cent of Icelandic workers now either work shorter weeks or have the right to ask to do so – but as is often the way with headlines about Nordic utopias, read a little closer and a few caveats emerge.Firstly, only one per cent of Iceland’s working population took part. Secondly, it was more about managing hours, rather than specifically a four-day week, and reportedly resulted in a reduction of just 35 minutes a week in the private sector and 65 in the public sector. And thirdly, the Icelandic government now has to hire more healthcare workers at an annual cost of £24.2 million in order to keep hospitals running 247.Mixed results, then. But Lancashire-born Barnes’s confidence is undimmed. He worked as a banker in London, where the working culture was such that he saw several people have nervous breakdowns in front of him. At one firm, new employees were forced to sign a pre-typed resignation letter on their first day, and told they’d see it again when they displeased the boss.When he moved to New Zealand, where he set up Perpetual , the country’s largest corporate trustee company, he decided to do things differently, inspired by research that found the average British worker was only engaged with their job for fewer than three hours a day.He announced that for a trial period, his 240-odd employees were going to be paid the same wage, but only asked to work four days instead of five – it was up to them to find ways to get their tasks done more efficiently, and which day to take off.It was a success: a 20 per cent rise in productivity, and an independent study found stress levels among his workforce decreased seven per cent, while overall life satisfaction increased by five per cent.“At the end of the day, what I want is my people to be the best they can be at work, and the best they can be at home, and if I can achieve that, I get a better outcome, but also the whole of society gets a better outcome,” he says.Barnes and Lockhart, who met at a party nine years ago and went on to work together at Perpetual , are evangelical about their mission – Lockhart drinks from a mug with “ALWAYS RIGHT” daubed across it – and prepared to put the hours in so we don’t have to. Given Lockhart has stage 4 breast cancer, with a prognosis of five years, they also have a deadline “to make this happen within that time.”The key, they say, is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach: managers must study their company and talk to their workers about how they could manage a four-day week without a decline in productivity. It might mean shutting up shop for one day, or if that’s impossible, trimming hours and rota-ing staff across the week. Barnes and Lockhart’s organisation can offer companies data and research, and show how others have done it, but not advise: what works for a building firm won’t work for a tech start-up.Sceptics point to how unskilled workers were disproportionately badly affected when France introduced a 35-hour week in 2000, and that some sectors such as construction or hospitality would find it far harder than, say, digital marketing to switch.Barnes counters that they have seen it work everywhere from car plants to hospitals. There are currently schools in the US operating on four-day weeks in order to cut costs, he says, maintaining education levels have not suffered. Dubiously, he reckons the extra day at home allows children to “complete more chores.” Hospitals, meanwhile, may need to hire, but he believes it would reduce burnout, stop bed-blocking, and increase retention rates.“Trust me,” Barnes says of Perpetual , where staff sort rotas themselves, “there’s no better team-building exercise than asking a workforce how they could do this.”Some companies, such as Microsoft in Japan, which trialled a four-day week in 2019 and saw productivity boosted by 40 per cent, cut down meetings to a maximum of five people and 30 minutes. An editor at a large UK media operation said instances of staff members coming to her with questions dropped, as many of those were simply stress-induced.“In one US company that tried this, applicant numbers have gone up 280 per cent as a consequence of how they shifted the structure of the week. Now, that’s quite important in the current environment, especially as we are always clear that this is not at the expense of productivity, profitability, pay or customer service,” Barnes says.“In fact productivity and profitability improves, so it is a sensible business strategy. The environmental and health benefits you get for free.”We update our work spaces, our computer software and our health and safety practices constantly. So why, they reckon, can we not revise the work week?“A lot of the challenges we face, whether it’s pressure on the health service, education, family cohesion, obesity, gender issues…” Barnes says, “are caused and exacerbated by the way we work.”  Lockhart puts down her mug and holds up a finger. “I’ll leave you with a quotation,” she says, “‘Whether you think you can, or whether you think you can’t, you are right.’”It was Henry Ford who first said that.More from NewsBurials lay the groundwork for St Helena’s future as hub for ‘slavery tourism’Two men in Ireland took body of dead man into post office to claim his pensionScientists unite to stop Imperial College cancelling biologist Thomas HuxleySaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The The con artist \u0026#39lawyer\u0026#39 who faked his way to the top – and duped the worldBoris Johnson’s chief of staff cancels meeting amid rumours he faces the sackMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street party before philip","story":"Downing Street party before Philip funeral ran to am with guests using Wilfs slideBoris Johnson apologised to the Queen this week over the events, which he said he deeply and bitterly regrettedthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-looks-down-during-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ZJOMpek,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The night before, officials danced while drinking wine in plastic cups, ordered takeaway pizza and tried out Boris Johnsonaposs son Wilfaposs slide, according to The .Government guidance at the time warned: “You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble. “You can meet outdoors, including in gardens, in groups of six people or two households.  Boris Johnson has apologised to the Queen for the events, which he said he deeply and bitterly regretted.The Prime Minister was not at either event as he was at his Chequers country retreat, No  said when the events were first reported last week. The latest details come as the PM was battling to save his premiership, with plans to spend the weekend at Chequers trying to win over his mutinous MPs. Officials allegedly took part in a seven-hour drinking session at two separate dos to say farewell to Boris Johnsonaposs top spin doctor and a Downing Street photographer. Theclaims to have obtained a picture of staff in the Downing Street basement, where people were drinking wine and spirits out of plastic cups.  Text messages also indicate that attendees were still partying at am, having started at around pm. The existence of photos and texts could provide further fuel for Sue Grayaposs partygate inquiry, which is expected to be published next week. One of the events was for James Slack, the PMaposs departing director of communications, which was held in the press area and then the garden. He has apologised for the bash. He said in a statement: “This event should not have happened at the time that it did. I am deeply sorry, and take full responsibility.”  The second event for a photographer, which was held in the basement, where an adviser alleged acted as a DJ using a laptop. Wine was reportedly spilled on a printer where the laptop was blaring music out. The events reportedly merged when they eventually moved to the garden, where it is alleged that some attendees went down a childaposs slide belonging to the PMaposs son Wilf. It was previously claimed that Wilfaposs swing had been broken by guests. Mr Johnson appeared visibly distressed when he told reporters that he had apologised to the Queen over the parties. I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened, he told reporters this week. I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.aposapos The revelations about the parties last week sparked a major backlash, compounding the Prime Ministeraposs woes as he battles for his own survival. The claim that an aide was dispatched to the Co-op supermarket on The Strand to fill a suitcase with wine was widely mocked. Last week, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning. No  has apologised to the Palace.

Here’s everything you need to know about the vote, including how many letters are needed to trigger itBoris Johnson might face a no confidence vote over Downing Street parties Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Jan | comments The prime minister is facing calls to resign from his own backbenchers as fury over the Partygate scandal and his handling of it. On Tuesday, January , over a dozen Tory MPs are thought to have met to conspire over Boris Johnson ’s future in a gathering dubbed as the ‘ pork pie plot.’ While some MPs have publicly urged Johnson to quit over the Downing Street parties held during the  lockdown, several MPs have reportedly already submitted their no confidence letters to the  Committee chaired by Sir Graham Brady.Here’s what you need to know about a no confidence vote and what will happen next. How is a vote of no confidence triggered   A vote of no confidence would be triggered% of Tory MPs write to Sir Brady saying they no longer have confidence in Boris Johnson.There were  Tory MPs - prior to Christian Wakefordaposs defection to Labour - this means that  would need to submit letters to trigger the no confidence vote.How many letters have been submitted is a closely guarded secret kept by Sir Graham, but MPs are free to publicly confirmthey have submitted theirs. For instance, veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both confirmed that they had submitted their letters. If the  letters are sent to the  Committee, then a vote is held with a secret ballot of Tory MPs taking place. The MPs will vote in support of or against their leader, andover % of them vote against Johnson, he will be ousted. What would happenBoris Johnson is ousted from his position  If majority votes against Johnson, a leadership contest to choose the countryaposs next leader would get underway immediately in the Conservative Party.Any leader who loses a confidence vote is not allowed to take part in the next leadership contest, so Johnson would not be able to compete. However,he wins the vote of no confidence, his position is secured for a further  months, although  backbenchers are murmuring about changing the rules to bring this down to six months.A general election will only take placehalf of MPs voted against the Government in a separate no confidence motion. Potential candidates for the next prime minister include Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Home Secretary Priti Patel as well as Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.What is the  Committee  The  Committee - formally known as the Conservative Private Members’ Committee - is a group of Tory backbenchers who meet weekly when the Commons is sitting to discuss party matters. Currently chaired by Sir Graham Brady, the MP for Altrincham and Sale West, the purpose of it is to give less senior members of the party an opportunity to discuss any issues. The committee will then have a monthly meeting with the party leader to share the opinions within the party.

However, some people will still wear face masksBoris Johnson announced the lting of Plan B restrictions next week Image: PAopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Jan | commentsHeadteachers who insist that pupils still wear masks in schools should be praised, not pilloried.They are doing the responsible thing. The same cannot be said of the Prime Minister. While the number of Omicron cases is falling in London it is still re in other parts of England. Boris Johnson chose to ignore this when he announced a blanket lting of Plan B restrictions this week.The sensible course would have been to maintain our guard until the threat posed by Omicron had subsided in every region. The Prime Minister is not being driven by the data – despite his repeated claims – but by politically expediency. Many believe he rushed into it because his job is on the line and he needs to curry favour with his backbenchers. It is entirely in keeping with Johnson’s behaviour that he has put his own interests ahead of those of the country. By continuing to wear masks the public are showing better judgment than those making the rules. Game to act There are few more sickening trades than trophy hunting. Killing endangered animals is not a sport but a heartless act of barbarity. So it is depressing to read that big game hunting is still big business in the US. The annual Safari Club International Convention in Las Vegas offers bloodthirsty Americans the chance to spend tens of thousands of dollars to slaughter wild animals. The UK government has pledged action on trophy hunting but has so far failed to bring in the necessary legislation. There is no reason for this delay.

He adds that when Tory politicians need to woo the populist vote they threaten to make the BBC pay for itselfCan you imagine this lot filling our BBC TV schedules opinionByBrian Reade:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan As far as the right is concerned the BBC has always been the Great Distractor. When foreign-based newspaper barons want to rail against the evils of liberal elites they home in on the leftie BBC. When Tory politicians need to woo the populist vote they threaten to make the Bloated Beeb pay for itself.The last time Boris Johnson played this hand was during the  General Election when he was attacked for refusing, while on-screen, to look at a Daily Mirror front page showing a sick four-year-old on an AE floor. Within hours he was threatening to scrap the TV licence.And now, as he sups in the Last Chance Saloon, he’s sent out his pom-pom swinging fangirl Nadine Dorries to tell BBC bosses she has their testicles in a vice. That’s the laughably titled culture secretary who believes taxpayers fund Channel  and probably thinks Lord Reith is something a peer lays at the Cenotaph.  Tories like to pretend they are in favour of public service broadcasting, so long as it can be bent to their will. But what would it look likethey ran the stripped-down BBC today. Here, I’m guessing, would be the highlights: the day opens with a recording of Vera Lynn singing God Save The Queen and is followed by Wake-Up Don’t Woke-Up presented by Esther McVey in the Downing Street TV studio with Julia Hartley-Brewer reviewing all papers except the Mirror and . CBeebies’ flagship show is Watch With Nanny in which Jacob Rees-Mogg’s nanny plays the penny whistle as his children, dressed in naval unorm, recite important dates from the Napoleonic Wars. Antiques Roadshow is revamped, with Bernard Ingham catching up with the latest views from local Conservative associations. As is Upstairs, Downstairs in which Rishi Sunak tells us what it’s like to live in a stately home during an energy crisis and how to cut off the heating in the servants’ quarters. On The Travel Show, Mark Francois lists things to do when stuck in three-hour passport queues in Europe due to Brexit, and Dominic Raab gives tips on how to ignore your mobile while relaxing on a Corfu sunbed as Kabul falls. In Flog It! think-tanks update us on ways to privatise the NHS and EastEnders becomes WestEnders, a story of First World problems in Fulham and Cha. On Jobsearch, Nadine Dorries herself explains how you can get your daughters on the public payroll and Matt Hancock shows how to give multi-million pound contracts to the bloke down the pub. Grandstand s with polo, croquet and fox-hunting with a shower of Berkeley Hunts, and foodies are served Truss’s Kitchen Nightmares, where the foreign secretary advises on how to cope when you run out of British cheese. There’s Dragons’ Den Does Dover in which Priti Patel hears contestants pitch new ways to repel migrants and Hospital will show the NHS in a fresh light, with no AE queues and staff delighted with their workload. Comedy-wise there’s Mock The Weak in which Jim Davidson and Roy Chubby Brown openly humiliate minorities, and Would I Lie To You  sees Boris Johnson do a weekly press conference. And each day closes at midnight with Land of Dope and Tory played from a model of the new royal yacht. Unless you’ve put your foot through your telly hours before and gone to bed, that is.

Marc Spaganuolo has spent the last  years struggling to control his bowels and his bladder - but stayed quiet about his condition because he was embarrassed. But now heaposs started making TikTok videos to let other people with incontinence know theyaposre not alone. Marc, , suffers from a degenerative nerve condition called peripheral neuropathy, meaning his brain doesnapost receive signals when the bladder and bowel are full. First suffering from incontinence when he was , he went through years of tests before finally getting his diagnosis when he was  years old.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Currently looking for love, Marc is even open and honest about his condition on his dating profile - claiming most people are open and understanding about it. He said: It started with bed wetting. I tried to hide it and blamed it on my dog at first. My dog was elderly so I got away with that for a few months. Eventually, my dad found out and said aposWe need to take you to the doctorapos. I didnapost want to go, but my dad was saying it could be a urinary tract infection. That convinced me. It was embarrassment that stopped me wanting to go. It wasnapost like it was happening every night, it was sporadic at first. Here and there. Now itaposs daily. At first, Marc was told heaposd grow out of the condition, but as time went on, it became clear that wasnapost the case.  After a while of living with the condition, he discovered protective underwear, which he now wears daily. I believe in being upfront about it. I feel like those terminologies created a ide in my mind and kept me from dealing with it. Itaposs a diaper, letaposs own it, he said. To go through this as a teenager was an isolating experience. Over time, I would tell a person here and person there, my courage would grow. It was a decade long process of telling people here and there. It was hard to define a specic point where I got confident, but I want people to feel confident in talking about it. For Marc, the ultimate show of confidence was when he set up the TikTok account. Using the alias aposThe Diaper Dynamoapos, Marc explains how incontinence affects his day-to-day le and how he deals with aposself-diaperingapos.  Now, one of Marcaposs challenges is the world of dating - but his condition throws up problems. He said: One of the biggest challenges of my le is dating, because itaposs been such a gradual process for me to get to where I am now. But of course, Iaposd love to meet somebody. But through his TikTok, heaposs hoping to tap into a community and provide support to those who need it. He said: I started my TikTok in September . I knew people needed help with this stuff, and it took off from there. TikTokaposs algorithm was really good at finding people who needed this content. Marc now has , followers on the , with most people offering him support about his condition. Itaposs been a pretty wild ride, itaposs been eye opening in a few dferent ways, he said. But putting myself out there on TikTok and seeing the overwhelming amount of love and support made me realise I need to put myself out there and give people a chance to respond.  Itaposs been so many years that Iaposve been living with this and Iaposve gotten so used to talking about it in my everyday le that I knew showing this would be a big deal to helping people. This is a really common issue and thereaposs a reason why these products are made. Explaining incontinence affects between  and  million people around the world, he said parents have thanked him for his honesty, saying itaposs helped their children. I feel incredibly honoured when parents say my videos helped their kid. It sometimes brings a tear to my eye, he said. It wasnapost where I was intending to go with the content, but the fact that it has an impact on them is great. One woman said she showed it to her six-year-old and she responded aposIaposm not a freakapos. Thataposs the point. Evenyou have to live this way for the rest of your le, you can still find happiness and be who you want to be. Due to the unpredictable nature of his condition, Marc makes sure heaposs always prepared and keeps spare nappies and wipes to hand to clear up any accidents. He said: I keep diapers in a backpack, along with wipes. It depends where Iaposm going and what Iaposm doing, of course. I prefer and recommend diapers because Iaposve heard so many horror stories about catheters and stomas. I just think aposwhy go through that when I can manage with a diaper apos If Iaposm at a social event, I tend to be more discreet about it. I still get self-conscious from time to time. When I used to work in an office, Iaposd change midday in a private restroom.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcWhile not everyone is kind about Marcaposs condition, many viewers of his videos are supportive.

Hannah Grinsted, who is due to get married in August, was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her st birthday.She claims she was repeatedly sent away by her GP over a period of five months in the belief that a lump in her armpit was being caused by something other than cancer.Following treatment, she began reliving her new le with the hope she had beaten cancer but tragically two years ago it ed, DevonLive reports.She has now been told her cancer is incurable, but treatments are available to prolong her le as much as possible with hope always around the corner of new trials. Hannah is now urging people to trust their gut instinctthey think something is seriously wrong with them and to not take no for an answer. Hannah, who previously worked for Avis Car Hire, recalled: I went to the doctors five to six times and I kept getting told it was a blocked gland or something to do with the deodorant I used, or it was related to my age and puberty.  I was not necessarily feeling poorly but I felt a lot of pain and I always thought that pain didnapost mean cancer but that isnapost the case. I was also suffering from pain down my back and front. Eventually I was referred to the RDE and a scan showed I had three tumours in my breast, and eight out my  lymph nodes had cancer in them so it was quite a lot. My first thought was that I was going to die. My mum was with me and she had an expression on her face I had never seen before. She was obviously very supportive and has been throughout my cancer journey. My whole world turned upside down in that moment and I went into a panic attack. Before Hannah began chemotherapy and radiotherapy in , due to her young age she was offered fertility treatment to preserve some of her eggs in case the treatment prevented her from being able to have children. Unfortunately, due to the severity of her cancer, Hannah was only able to have fertility treatment over a -day period which meant only four of her eggs have been able to be stored which greatly reduced her chances of becoming a mum. She also underwent a mastectomy and reconstruction surgery and had her lymph nodes removed. Hannah was later told she was in remission but says she never received a final scan to confirm the diagnosis.It was assumed I was cancer-free so I put on Facebook the good news, she said. I had not told anyone before then that I had cancer.However, around six months later while on a girly holiday in Ibiza, Hannah began experiencing severe problems with one of her legs. Suddenly she was unable to walk or put weight on it and kept falling over. On her , she went to her GP and said she had feared the cancer had ed, but says she was reassured it hadnapost and was sent home. After her leg showed no signs of improvement she was eventually referred back to hospital. On Christmas Eve , her worst fears were confirmed when she received a telephone call saying the cancer was back and this time it was in her femur. Hannah recalled: I was sat on my own at work on the late sht when I got the telephone call. When cancer gets into your bone itaposs incurable. I had a metal pole fitted into the centre of my femur because my bones are very brittle now. I also had one batch of radiotherapy and was on oral chemotherapy for about  months. The cancer held in my bone for about  months which was quite good, but about three months ago it was confirmed it had moved to my liver. Now itaposs also moved to my lungs, unfortunately, and the bottom of my pelvis.  It means that Hannah has started a course of intravenous chemotherapy treatment once a week for  weeks. This week she received her fth bout and has lost her hair again. In a bid to boost her spirits ahead of her upcoming wedding day in August, Hannahaposs cousin Sammi Williams has launched an online fundraiser called Help Hannah Fight Cancer. So far it has already raised more than £, of its target of £,. The fundraiser is being used to help make Hannahaposs big day the best it can be for her and her partner of nearly three years Charlie Cox,  - and it is also funding a luxurious handmade wig to help Hannah feel more confident.

The single-storey addition to the property near Stafford, West Midlands, was priced at £, and was supposed to take a fortnight. But months later, the coupleaposs garden still contains a roofless wreck - leaving them feeling stupid and out of pocket. Shocking pictures show half-built brick walls and materials strewn across a muddy patch of ground. A packed green skip overflowing with debris and buckets has been left outside the front of the Staffordshire property.  Kylie and David, who have two children, said Mark asked for money upfront but then went off the radar. And the pair claim that, since the ordeal, they have been told that he wasn’t qualied to do the promised work - and has been involved in similar situations previously. But, when challenged, Mark says he contracted out the work to others - who let him down. Nurse Kylie said: This was a horrendous experience. It sapped our time, money, and energy and left us feeling stupid and upset.  We both work very hard - we worked all through the pandemic. Heaposs taken our money and ruined our garden, and left us with a wreck. When he asked for money I paid it, because it was getting colder and darker and I was worried the work wouldn’t get finishedI didn’t. We knew building materials were running low in the country, so we were really understanding about it.  Kylie and David hired Mark, the director of Chase Home Solutions, to build onto the sitting room of their s townhouse last year. They say he first visited the family home at the end of July and quoted them £,. That cost would cover a three-by-three metre squared pitched roof extension and the replacement of windows in two upstairs rooms, it was said. Kylie said she was impressed by Mark, so signed him up for the job - which he said would take a fortnight.  They scheduled the building work to start on September , and agreed the windows would be replaced beforehand. Kylie says she repeatedly asked about planning permission and building regulations, but Mark said not to worry - because he would sort everything. The trader then asked for £, upfront, with a further £, agreed for when the extension reached roof height.  The next £, would be paid when the roof went on, it was decided, and the final £, when the building had all the electricity in and passed regulations. Kylie says she made the first payment on August  and, when Mark then asked for another £, on August , she paid again. But the builders didnapost show up on the start day - as they were still on another job, according to Mark. And the day after he said they couldnapost come because there was a problem with the skip. Two men finally appeared on September , holding shovels and pushing a wheelbarrow - but claiming Mark had refused to pay for a digger.  Kylie said a bricklayer then arrived and said the extension had not been measured correctly - meaning the couple would have to extend another . metres across the house. This prompted Mark to ask for another £, for the bigger extension, which was paid. But it took the workers a further two weeks to dig and concrete the foundations - because they only showed up for a maximum of four hours a day, Kylie claims. She said: “They told my neighbour they were worked into the ground on ours and working other jobs. They would do a little bit then say they had to go, often they blamed it on the weather.I never saw any materials stored at our property. The lads brought small amounts in the boot of their car. I think he was taking them from other projects. He said he kept them in a lockup, but much later his son told me he didnapost have one. Kylie then paid Mark another £, on September , and another on October . But, by then, the lads were only managing a couple of hours every few days - and Kylie was feeling desperate. She told Mark she felt he had done them over, and he replied that they were having a few problems. The builders never showed again - so Kylie asked for her money back on October . Mark replied to say heaposd call her later and theyaposd work all weekend on her house, she said. But his call never came, and Kylie says that when she now dials the number she used to contact Mark a message says the phone is switched off. Since then, six builders have looked at Kylie’s extension and agree it doesnapost meet building regulations, she said. They say it need to be torn down and should not have amounted to no more than five days effort, it is claimed.  Kylie also alleges that she and David then went to Markaposs flat on October , where a man - estimated to be in his s and calling himself Markaposs son - answered the door. She said: “I explained what had happened and he didn’t know what to do with himself. He said, ‘oh god, not that againapos.Kylie posted on a local Facebook chat and five other families came forward with similar stories.This has been incredibly stressful, she said. Itaposs such a mess, and we donapost have loads of money. People need to be aware that there are cowboys like him out there. Thereaposs no way we could have known - he seemed so professional. I wouldnapost pay all that money upfront again. Every business should have enough in the account to buy materials. When confronted with Kylieaposs claims, Mark said: “During the pandemic I put £, of my own money into starting a building business. I sub-contracted the work and paid them in advance. One build failed an inspection, and another was completely incorrect. It snowballed on social media very quickly. Kylie was one of my customers and I apologised to her mother and offered to put her work right, but they wouldn’t let me. I lost all the contracts and have been left with £, debt and my company is not viable. I really feel for Kylie. The builders have let everyone down. Both have changed their phone numbers and one has closed down his business.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mark Jones\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"family use kettle wash theyve","story":"Family use kettle to wash as theyve had no hot water or heating since Boxing DayLorraine King, , and her three kids have had to wash themselves with hot water from a kettle since their West London home was damaged by a leak on Boxing Daythis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video family-use-kettle-wash-after-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:rXNYwTe,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Care worker Lorraine King, , and her kids have had to wash themselves with hot water from a kettle since their home in West London was damaged by a leak.She told MyLondon: I’ve got to either boil the kettle or even go and take a bath at my daughter’s which is miles away. It’s not convenient.Lorraine, who works in care, said her home, owned by the Catalyst Housing association, has flooded at least once a year since she moved in. She said: It’s happened in the front room three times and also the bedroom, bathroom, toilet. It’s just constant. -  She said the latest incident happened on Boxing Day, when water flooded through the ceiling of her front room where her granddaughter was playing. Lorraine lives with her son and two daughters and they are still waiting for their home to be fixed and claims sheaposs had no advice on when it will be sorted.She also said multiple maintenance workers have come to the property since but no one has fixed the issue and there seems to be poor communication across the company.  She added: The repairs take extra long to do. The guy left us with no hot water or heating. Then they contacted me two weeks later and told me they weren’t aware we didn’t have any heating. They gave us these little oil heaters, which don’t heat up the room at all. The whole house really does smell because of the flood. According to Lorraine, someone came to look at the problem weeks later and turned the electricity back on within a few hours another leak happened.  She said: The whole thing was flooded. There was no advice. I’ve still got no heating or hot water. Every contractor who comes says they don’t know anything about it and they’ve just come to assess it. Clearly they’re not communicating. Lorraine said she is worried a family member could be electrocuted because of the damp conditions and the stress of the repeated leaks is affecting her mental health. She said: It’s happened so much, I’m now having mental health issues and I never had this before I moved into the property. On Saturday, I had a total meltdown because I just couldn’t handle it any more and I’ve still got to come into work. I can’tproperly because I don’t feel myself.  Lorraine says she was on the housing waiting list for  years before she moved into her first permanent home in Kensington and Cha in . But she said the new build has had so many defects she almost cannot stand to live there any more. She said: Eventhey repair it I’m not comfortable in that property because I’ll decorate it and it’ll be ruined again. A spokesperson for Catalyst said: “We are sorry for the inconvenience and distress caused. We believe the source of the current problem is a leaking communal heating pipe in Ms King’s ceiling. To permanently fix the pipe, we need to take down the ceiling, and we are speaking with Ms King to arrange for adequate access to her home and enough time to complete the work and replace and redecorate her ceiling.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mental healthFloodspovertyHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lton Parish Council has written to residents about the complaints of aposDarkey Laneapos and have askedthey want to change it or not. If residents choose to rename the road, it would be the responsibility of West Devon Borough Councilwhich would then do their own consultationa desire for change was expressed, DevonLive reports. The letter from January  reads: I have been asked to write to you on behalf of Lton Parish Council following receipt of a complaint about the street name Darkey Lane made by two visitors to the village. What do you think about this story  Let us know in the comments below  The visitors, one of who is of Caribbean heritage, were shocked and extremely upset having been confronted with a name like this. Councillors took the decision at a parish council meeting on November , , to undertake a public consultation with you in early January , to find outyou would like to keep or change the existing road name. It went on to explain that to rename the road, two-thirds of households on Darkey Lane would have to be in agreement. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Furthermore,they wanted to change the name then each household would have to pay £ to WDBC. The parish council have offered to pay for replacement road signs. Residents on the road would also be required to tell utility companies and all professional and personal contacts regarding any new road name. In the same letter, the parish council gave historical context on how the road got its name. It said: Darkey Lane was a historic, locally-based road name given before development in the local area. The road had originally been a sunken and tree-lined dark lane. Over the years and with the use of local Devonshire dialect, it became known as Darkey Lane. Robert Fleming, the owner of Lton Hall Hotel, is in favour of changing the roadaposs name. He said: I agree that the name should be changed. I think historically that the lane may have been called Darke Lane in the old English spelling, as indeed the lane is very dark and tree covered in places. The fact that the word ‘darkey’ has negative connotations, and has and continues to be used as such, supersedes historical spellings where they may have had a dferent meaning. People may be offended so it should be changed as standard, with a minimum of fuss. Indeed as a hotelier in the area, we have had people actually mention their surprise at the name of the lane as it is quite close to us. When I moved here  years ago I remember being rather shocked at it as we had moved down from London and lived in a multi-racial area of East London. Lton can not by any stretch of the imagination be classed as multi-racial. For people objecting to the change, I thinkthey could imagine themselves as being in a minority of some sort and then have a derogatory work on a street name that affected  upset them it may garner a dferent response. The name could be just Darke Lane or even Dark Lane which is minimal effort. In this advanced age we live in it should be a simple matter to change all the databases etc, although people may decide to live with it as it means changing passport  drivers licences and so on which obviously will incur some costs. Lton Parish Council said the results of the consultation will be reported at its next meeting later this month on January .

The Department for Educationhas published provisional figures on funding for mainstream schools in the - financial year, based on the National Funding Formula . These figures are subject to revision and are not necessarily what schools will actually receive, since they are based on pupil data from -.Use our interactive widget to explore this projected funding for your school - and see how this compares both locally and nationally:The Government has committed to giving schools an increase in their pupil-led funding of at least .% per pupil.However, this is below the Office for Budget Responsibility’s most recent inflation projection of .% - meaning nearly , state-funded schools are projected to see a real-terms cut in their funding.The figures also show that there are huge dferences in the amount of money state schools receive per pupil, even between those in the same area. These figures exclude specialist SEN schools, as these are funded dferently to other schools. It includes both maintained schools, which are overseen by the local authority, and academies, which operate independently and receive their funding directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency. Generally, funding is made up of a basic lump sum that all schools of that level are entitled to, plus funding on top of that based on the number of pupils, and extra money for pupils with additional needs - such as those living in deprivation. There are also other funding streams that relate to things like geographical isolation and expected growth in pupil numbers. The process was set to be formalised by , with all local authorities moving to the National Funding Formula, but as a result of signicant challenges, the Government has delayed its implementation. As such, local authorities currently decide how money is shared out between schools in its area, using its own funding formula based on DfE guidance.

It was a vicious cycle of me wanting comfort in junk food anything that was bad for me and anything to do with exercise I was horried by.“I was eating to suppress those feelings.

Estelle Wignall has stage four oian cancer which recently spread to her bowel and doctors have told her she is terminally ill.A mum to baby daughter, Brooke,  months, she has been offered palliative care.But Estelle insists she is up for the fight, and has launched a fundraising campaign through GoFundMe to seek treatment overseas.She says: “I feel as though I have been written off, but I am not ready to throw in the towel yet. I’ve bounced back before, and I am determined to do it again. To help Estelle raise money for treatment overseas, you can donate here. I want to celebrate my little girl’s second birthday, I want to see her start school, I want to mark as many milestones as I can.” Estelle, , from Wigan, Greater Manchester, was diagnosed with oian cancer five years ago after becoming tired and bloated. Doctors at first insisted she had IBS but her symptoms became so bad that she was rushed to hospital and then sent home again with medication. She said: “I picked up a leaflet in hospital about oian cancer and I immediately diagnosed myself. But everyone told me not to be so stupid because I was only  years old. “People said I was being a hypochondriac. Nobody took me seriously – but I just knew. It was an instinct.” Estelle pushed for tests and in February , she was finally diagnosed with grade one oian cancer. She had a tumour removed, along with her right oy and Fallopian tube. After making a full recovery, she put the cancer behind her, working as a receptionist and marrying soulmate Mike, , in June  in Texas. The couple had their first child, Brooke, in May . Estelle said: “I had only one oy and so to conceive so quickly felt like a miracle. I didn’t have my regular checks because I was pregnant, and during the birth the midwe actually noticed nodules on my cervix and I was referred for more tests, which came back clear. “We adored Brooke and the future looked fantastic.  “I was actually planning a hysterectomy so that there was no chance the cancer could .” But before her op, Estelle started to feel unwell, suffering from exhaustion and a lack of appetite. She said: “I had started the  week diet challenge, to get rid of my baby weight. I just needed to lose a stone, that was all. “But I started to feel very tired and I had no appetite. I thought it was all due to the diet – but it got worse and I began to think the cancer might be back.” In November , she was sent for urgent scans and was diagnosed with stage four cancer, which had spread to her liver and lungs.  She said: “I was devastated. The first time I had cancer, I coped well. But this time, because of Brooke, I was heartbroken. She was just six months old and it felt so cruel. I had only just started being a mum, and I didn’t want it to be taken away. She was initially told her le expectancy was only two or three years but her outlook improved after treatment and a raft of alternative therapies. “There have been points when I felt I could not go on. I considered euthanasia. But I kept going, and I got my spirits up again, she said. A recent scan showed the cancer has spread once again to the bowel and Estelle is now being warned that her time is fast running out. She says: “I’ve been on the brink before and I have bounced back and I am determined to do it again. I can’t give up, I have too much to live for, and I am determined to look for treatment abroad. “I hope also that my story can help other women, it is so important, no matter how young you are, to follow your instincts and to insist on answers.

The dog was banned from Buckingham Palace because of the incident, but the Prince seemed to only see the funny side.Mrs Briggs has recalled what happened after she says Bendicks reacted badly when she started using the vacuum cleaner. She told The Sun her leg was left bleeding and her tights were ripped.The maid, then , was sent to the Duke’s personal physician for a tetanus jab, but when she quizzed a butler she was stunned by what she says was Andrewaposs reaction to the attack. She says “they just laughed - and nobody said sorry. “He wasn’t bothered, she said. Even when I was limping and my leg was purple he never apologised. It’s those little things that tell a lot about people and their character.” Bendicks also attacked a carpet fitter and the Duke’s equerry before his death in  aged , it was reported. It is the latest embarrassing anecdote to humiliate the Prince.It comes after reports the embattled Duke of York would allegedly scream and shoutBuckingham Palace servants failed to follow his exact plan for the arrangement of his teddy bears.He was also claimed he demanded his water be strictly served at room temperature and that his valet haul around a six-foot ironing board on foreign trips. Sources say the Duke was known for being rude and having childish obsessions - as he was ridiculed while on the road fulfilling royal duties, reports claim. The former deputy head of mission in Bahrain, Simon Wilson, says the royalaposs travelling entourage left people speechless. The diplomat, who had previously hosted the Duke, says the Prince became known as HBH - His Buffoon Highness.  He added that Andrew was rude and boorish and wasnapost well-liked. Andrew is awaiting a civil sex case in the US, with the trial scheduled to take place between September and December. Virginia Giuffre is suing the duke for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager and claims she was trafficked by Andrew’s friend, the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, to have sex with the duke when she was  and a minor under US law. The Duke has always vehemently denied the allegations.

He finally relented when his mum intervened, according to an ex-maid. Former Buckingham Palace staff member Janette McGowan - who had travelled with the Firm to the residence in Norfolk - revealed Andrewaposs childish tantrum, said to have happened over Christmas . She said astonished colleagues were alerted to the situation after the Duke put his things into the wrong bathroom and then refused to move them.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Charles would have been  at the time.Ms McGowan told The Sun : We were told not to move anything and not to touch anything in that bathroom because there was an aposongoing situationapos.She explained that when members of the family travel to Sandringham - where the monarch usually hosts her annual festive lunches - they are each allocated rooms and bathrooms. But on this occasion Andrew took the wrong one and wouldnapost budge, the former maid continued, adding: It turned into a bizarre stand-off.  In the end, the Queen herself had to intervene to defuse the situation. She actually had to have words with Andrew and say to him that he had to use the other bathroom and that was when he finally backed down. He was almost  at the time. It was very odd behaviour for someone of that age. She added, in contrast, Prince Charles was very grown-up about it and simply waited for the Queen to step in. Ms McGowan, , worked at the Palace from  to , and said the strangest thing was there was nothing special about the bathroom, but rather Andrew seemed to resent Charles being regarded as superior.  He arrived first and put his toiletries in a bathroom that wasnapost opposite his bedroom, she said.It comes after another former maid said she had no regrets in speaking out against Andrew who she described as a horrible man.Charlotte Briggs claimed the Duke of York often erupted into demanding and entitled foul-mouthed rants which left her in tears.The -year-old, who lives in Halax, West Yorkshire, made front-page news this week when she revealed her experiences doing the job nobody wanted six months after starting work for the royals in January . She described the Queenaposs second son as a spoiled brat who once allegedly - after noticing sheaposd left a gap in the curtains - fumed: Can’t you f***ing do anything right  Charlotte says since then she has been ridiculed in her hometown and accused of selling out.But believes she is entitled to speak about what happened to me even though it was years ago.Charlotte has also been keen to point out while she considered Prince Andrewaposs attitude poor, she never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour. The Duke is facing a civil trial after being accused of sexual abuse by a trafficking victim of his late paedophile pal billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein.

A new sub-strain of the Omicron Covid iant is being investigated by scientists after it was discovered in the UK.At the present moment, there is no indication that sub-iant BA. is more severe than the original strain of Omicron. In Denmark, this strain consisted of about half of all Omicorn cases. Initial studies from the country are suggesting there is no increased risk of hospitalisation.  It is also thought that the current vaccines are effective against the BA. strain in fighting severe illness, according to Danish health officials. However, it is unclear whether the strain could be more transmissible as more data is needed to test that possibility. UKHSA are continuing to monitor data on the BA. sub-lineage closely. The strain BA. shares a number of similarities with BA., which is why they are both considered to be Omicron. However, it has dferent S-gene mutations compared to BA., which means when carrying out a PCR test BA. shows positive for the S-gene while BA. does not.Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at UKHSA, said: “This latest set of analysis once again demonstrates that a booster dose of the vaccine provides you with signicant protection against hospitalisation from Omicron.Booster doses also increase the protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection which will reduce transmission in the population.While signs remain encouraging on Omicron’s severity compared with Delta, the high levels of community transmission continue and may cause pressures on health services. “We’ll be undertaking further analysis to investigate the small rise in the number of children admitted to hospital but currently Covid- poses a very low health risk to children and infants.Early data shows that young children who are hospitalised experience mild illness and are discharged after short stays in hospital.“Getting your booster jab remains the most effective way of protecting yourself and others from infection and severe disease. While prevalence remains high, make sure to wear your mask in indoor settings and take a lateral flow test before meeting others. If you develop any symptoms, isolate immediately and get a PCR test.”Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: “This data is yet more evidence that vaccines remain our best line of defence against COVID-.“Booster jabs are protecting people against infection and severe disease – so I urge you to play your part in our national mission and get boosted now.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsPublic servicesOmicron iantCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nickie Murtagh, , a childminder from London, used the beds twice a week before discovering a dry patch on her scalp. It soon turned into a lump and she raced to the doctor before hearing the news she had basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer. Since successfully having the lump removed and a skin graft from her thigh, mum-of-three Nickie has been left with a bald patch on her scalp which she says looked like she has been shot in the head. Nickie now wears SPF all year round and wants to raise awareness of the dangers that sunbeds and sun damage can cause to your skin.Were you aware of this  Join the discussion in the comment section  She said: When I was in my twenties I would use a lot of sunbeds. I went a couple of times a week and would go on for about eight to  minutes. I didnapost exceed the recommended, so I didnapost think too much of it. I would also avoid using sun cream, especially on my face, because I didnapost want to stop myself from catching a tan. I thought that sun cream would stop me tanning, which I know now isnapost the case. First of all, I noticed a dry patch on my scalp which eventually turned into a lump in my parting line. I went to the doctors to get it checked out but they told me it was fine and nothing to worry about. I then went on holiday to Tenere and it got much worse. I was also getting bad melasma on my face and my tan was very patchy. My skin just didnapost feel right at all. After ing from her holiday, Nickie went back to the doctors where she says she was told, once again, that everything was fine. But the lump on her head was making her self-conscious, so she decided to go back to the doctors because she wanted it removed whether it was cancer or not. Nickie said: The doctors told me it was a cosmetic procedure and I would have to pay for it. I got really upset and eventually, they sent a referral to the dermatologist. After an appointment with the dermatologist, they told me they thought it was cancer straight away and biopsied me there and then. While waiting for the results, my family stayed so positive and reassured me it was going to be fine and although the dermatologist thought it was cancer, I still wasnapost really expecting it. Seven weeks later I received the results and I was told it was skin cancer - basal cell carcinoma. When I heard the C word I instantly felt like my world was ending and I was going to die. I worried about my kids and my family. It was terrying. I was offered radiotherapy or surgery. I chose surgery because it was less invasive and avoids the side effects that come with radiotherapy. I just wanted it to be gone. So I had surgery to remove the cancer and a skin graft from my thigh which was successful and I was given the all-clear. Nickie says that the skin graft was the worst part of her experience as her thigh would not stop bleeding. After having the staples removed from the area that the lump was removed from, she says that it was so gruesome and shocking. Nickie added: It was awful. It looked like I had been shot in the head. And I was terried to wash my hair and make it worse. My hair hasnapost and wonapost grow back in that area because the skin is from my thigh. And I have also lost all feeling in it. I canapost see it very well because it is on the top of my head, but it makes me feel self-conscious when I catch people staring at it or sometimes kids point it out. I try to use it to teach them a lesson to wear hats and sun cream. I also donapost like to wear shorts because people can see the scar on my leg from the skin graft. I am so much more cautious in the sun now and I avoid sunbeds at all cost. I am much more educated about sun damage and sun protection. I always wear a hat and I have SPF on every single day of the year. The sun doesnapost have to be hot to cause damage.

Another boy, found guilty of manslaughter for his part in the brutal stabbing of -year-old Reece, was jailed for six years. A court heard that the attackers - named Boy A and Boy B for legal reasons - had agreed to meet up in the early hours of May  in Walker Avenue, Bolton, because of an escalating dispute between Boy B and a friend of the victim. But when Reece arrived he was stabbed six times by Boy A. He banged on the door of a nearby house desperately pleading for help before falling to the ground. And, having been discovered by two men, he used his final breath to tell them the names of his killers.  Police arrived at the scene minutes later and Reece was rushed to Salford Royal Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at .am. A pathologist concluded his death was caused by multiple stab wounds, which were likely to have been inflicted by a kne with a -cm blade. After fleeing the scene, Boy A sent a Snapchat video of himself carrying a kne covered in blood, accompanied by the word muppet. He later sent a message to Boy B, which read: I thought it only went through his coat so I kept doing it. Adding: Heaposs dead now. Boy B responded with a laughing emoji.  Both teenagers appeared at a sentencing hearing at Manchester Crown Court todaywhere judge Justice Farbey was told there was a long-standing hate between Boy B and Reece, and Boy A had been brought into the dispute as support. During a three-week trial, jurors heard that the two boys had goaded Reece and his friend into meeting them, but he was initially reluctant. The court heard he had sent a message to his friend, which read: Getting brought into your s* again. Ainapost in no f**** mood. All four boys eventually agreed to meet that night and Reece left home and headed to the rendezvous point near Great Lever Park. But as Reece was en route, his friend informed him that he had decided to stay in bed.  Before the trial Boy A admitted to killing Reece but denied murder. Boy B admitted he was there but denied killing Reece or knowing Boy A had a kne. Richard Wright QC, who represented Boy A in the trial, told the court how the dispute was part of a petty subculture brought on via social media. Mr Wright said: It is a fact that they were all young people and a fact that their culture, that all of them engaged in, driven by social media led to them meeting up. He added: It might be said that all were particularly vulnerable due to their age, from being drawn into this petty sub-culture of social media interactions and bravado. They were all vulnerable to that and unfortunately one of them lost their le.  In a victim statement read out in court, Reeceaposs mum Laura said: Reece was our -year-old son, he made us smile, he made us laugh, he made us tear our hair out at times, a typical teenage lad, but he was ours. Reece was fiercely protective of his mum and little brother and saw himself as the man of the house. His dad saw him as his best friend. Reece was simply our world, and his death has devastated us beyond belief.

The North East of England has suffered some of the countryaposs highest Covid infection rates in . Experts say it is an Omicron hotspot after the outbreak moved north from London.The region was home to seven of the  local authorities with the highest infection rates this month. One in  peoplein the region tested positive in the week to January , the highest of any point in the pandemic.  The alarming rate of infection was highest in Middlesbrough with , cases per , people. Stockton came in third in England, Hartlepool fourth and Redcar fth in UK Health Security Agency research. Today education chiefs, politicians and ordinary voters united to condemn the Governmentaposs lting of compulsory mask wearing and working from home rules. Former steel worker Barry Heseltine, , of Redcar, North Yorkshire, said: He is lting the restrictions to save his own skin.  He is doing this to take away from the trouble he is in. But we will wear the masks for a while yet. His we Joyce, , added: I voted for him but he shot himself in the foot. He probably thinks it will blow over like everything . I thought he did well at first. Not now. Retired telephonist Patricia Blackett, , from Thornaby on Teesside, was wearing a mask and would continue to do so indoors at crowded venues like cinemas and theatres.  She added: I think the Prime Minister is trying to appease us and the people in the party. He is trying to take attention away from what he has done.Butyou have lost a loved one I donapost think that you will forget that and vote for him again. He has lost all credibility. I voted Tory but I am all for Keir Starmer now.He is a smart lawyer, a QC. I think that I will vote for him next time, the same goes for my daughter and son. Sixth formers Faith Lucas and Jessica Brown, both  and from Brotton, East Cleveland, are both planning to wear masks even after the Government lts the restriction.  Jessica, a psychology, business and law student, said: I think that I will keep on wearing one into the summer when it will become more dficult when it is hot. I think Boris is guilty of double standards with parties, he asked us to stick to the rules, but he did not do that himself. Faith added: You need to keep masks in enclosed spaces, especially on transport. I am not involved in politics just yet but obviously he should not have been having a party in lockdown. I know there is now a lot of pressure on him.Mum-of-two Pauline Collins, , of Middlesbrough, vowed to continue mask-wearing while shopping, on buses and on trains. I am not really sure about Boris Johnson, she said.I do think he should not be lting the restrictions completely. You should wear them on public transport and places like shopping centres. It is dferent for the young, they are not as worried about it as us oldies.  Singer John Rowland, , a dad-of-three who worked in Spain, Greece, Holland, Germany, Italy and Gibraltar before setting up as a busker in Middlesbrough town centre  years ago, said there is no saving Boris Johnson. Pardon the language, he has been a cluster****, he told the Mirror. It has gone too far for him now so it does not matter what he does. You look at other countries that have dealt with Covid so much better. I have friends in New Zealand, their leaders have handled it properly. He told how his we Hayley, , and children Grace, , Alex,, and eight-year-old Noah all went down with Covid before Christmas. He added: My we works in a school and got the Delta strain  months ago and she was really ill, and then we all got what was probably the Omicron iant. I was not at deathaposs door, it was like a bad flu virus. But I would not wish it on anybody, we have seen so many people lose loved ones.  Middlesbrough Labour MP Andy McDonald said his office was inundated with voters complaining about Boris Johnson. They are expressing their sheer anger at him. Welsh leader Mark Drayford summed it up, he said. He is being guided by the data and public health priorities, we are being driven by politics. I would be guided by the professionals who think we should maintain our guard for a little longer. On masks, people will make their own minds up and I support them fully on that. Almost  per cent of North East schools reported staff levels of below  per cent this week. At a quarter of them, it was less than  per cent. Only one in ten schools had student attendance levels of more than  per cent.  Chris Zarraga, director of campaign group Schools North East, said: Schools are still facing real challenges in getting staff cover, increasing staff workload and stress. There are serious concerns for schools, with local pictures often radically dferent from the national picture. The Government must support headteachers to put in place those measures necessary for their own school’s context. Andy Byers, headteacher at Framwellgate School, Durham, has asked students to keep wearing masks. More than  pupils and  members of his staff are isolating, with a small number quite poorly. In Stockton-on-Tees, pop up vaccination clinics are in place. Sarah Bowman-Abouna, their Director of Public Health, said: “We know uptake across Teesside is lower than other parts of the country. We are tackling this by making it as easy as possible for people to come to a walk-in centre. We want to discourage this myth that the Omicron iant is less serious than other iants. The truth is we can’t guarantee that infection will cause less serious illness so it’s vital we vaccinate as many people as possible.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonJohn Grosvenor RowlandConservative PartyEducationSchoolsPublic transportShopping centresFluPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirusDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kerry Lyn Caviasca allegedly left her children, both below the age of , home alone for two days in November.Caviasca, a teacher from Connecticut, is accused of leaving the children to survive on sweets and Uber deliveries while she went on holiday to Florida and partied with her boyfriend, according to court documents obtained by NBC Connecticut.Caviasca’s ex-husband reported her police in December. He claimed both children missed school on Monday, November , and he was unable to contact them over the weekend. Court documents claim he told police he sent his own father to the house to check on them, but he wasn’t able to reach the children. When the concerned father later asked the children whether they had been left home alone, they told him no, reports the New York Post. But after going through messages on a phone he had brought for one of the children, he reportedly saw a number of messages between Caviasca and the children over the course of the weekend in question. Some of the messages reportedly show the children asking their mother what they should eat for dinner, with her allegedly replying Just eat candy and What ever [sic] is downstairs. Police arrived at Caviasca’s home after initial reports, but she originally claimed her brother had been looking after the children - before eventually admitting they had been left alone. Caviasca was arrested on January  and charged with two counts of risk of injury to a minor and two counts of reckless endangerment in the second degree, according to NBC Connecticut. She is to appear in court on Jan. . Waterbury Public Schools district said Caviasca had been placed on leave while the district conducts its own investigation.

Although busy schedules can sometimes get in the way of giving your bed a refresh, experts at the Sleep Foundation have revealed that we should all be washing our bed sheets at least once a week - insisting that every couple of weeks doesnapost cut it.And in some cases, you should be washing your sheets even more than the recommended amount of once a week. Experts have suggested that someone who suffers from asthma or allergies should wash their sheets more frequently to improve overall wellbeing.  Andyouaposre someone who sleeps with a beloved dog or cat, then you should consider throwing your sheets in the washing up to twice a week to get rid of germs and bacteria that your furry friends may have carried from their outdoor adventures. If youaposre someone who likes to eat snacks when in bed, you should also be washing your sheets more than once a week. And people who go to bed without showering, or people who sleep naked, should also follow suit and stock up on some extra washing powder.  The biggest mistake many of us make is leaving our bedding on for more than a week, as they warn it leads to us apossleeping while surrounded by body oils, bacteria, dead skin cells, and dust mitesapos. Keeping your bed clean and hygienic can help thwart germs and allergens, and has even been found to help you sleep better. When it comes to your duvet, it doesnapost need washing as often as your sheets, but itaposs always good to give them a good clean every now and then - ideally every two months. Pillows should be washed at the same time, and the mattress itself should be given a clean down once a year.

She says: Ever wondered how McDonaldaposs know whose car is whose  There is a camera and it takes a picture of you and your car, she said. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The -year-old explained that the orders are handed to the correct customer thanks to a handy camera. After an order is placed, a camera takes a snap of the car, linking it to the order. So the worker just has to match the picture with the car in front of them. She later joked: So maybe don’t pick your nose when you order … because we see it and we judge you. Since being posted, the video has wowed McDonaldaposs fans. One said: Wow really  I had no idea there were cameras. Another said: Ayo thataposs some new new. We didnapost have that when I worked there last year. A third said: Wait yaposall see us  Fellow employees also revealed that they can hear everything that goes on inside the customersapos car from the moment it pulls up and activates the sensor, which then triggers their headset to turn on. Iaposm waiting for the day they realise we hear them the moment they pull up, to the moment they leave the speaker box, the worker said. But unfortunately for one member of staff, they admitted the McDonaldaposs he works at is not that advanced, and that we just have to figure it out.

The woman explained that after being together for four years, her fiancé finally moved in with her. She bought her home seven years ago, so the majority of the furniture is hers, but theyaposre talking of aposmaking it a home for both of them.apos But sheaposs noticed when his mum comes over she snoops and goes through her stuff.Taking to Reddit, she said: One thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little aposaffirmationapos post-it note on my monitor saying aposI am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great thingsapos.It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. Anyway, she made a comment about my ego... So while wine drunk one night, she and her friend decided to write a few more aposaffirmationsapos to hide as a joke. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Some were: Medicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful! Kitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self-assured! Work desk: I will not just f**k my way to the top of the company, I will f**k my way to the top of the world! Walk-in closet: I am beautul with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary! The next time her mother-in-law came over, she saw a few and while she didnapost directly acknowledge them, she did start acting really strangely. I went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea, she continued. She then showed him the notes and he didnapost really know what to make of it. He asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self-confidence and make myself laugh how had she gotten them  Had she been going through my things  He said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were really weird. He askedI left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private s**t so what I said about her needing to stop snooping. He said I was making stuff hard for him, his mum was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldnapost be a good partner when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me! She concluded her post by asking users whether she was out of order for playing the prank, and the majority of people were on her side as they slammed the mother-in-law for invading her privacy. While others criticised her fiance for not standing up for her. One person said: If you don’t set boundaries with your fiancé’s mother now, it’s going to be infinity times worse once you get married. Another wrote: It says a lot how he keeps defending her and chalks it up to be overprotectiveness. While I always hate to jump on the band wagon of aposomg this is immensely terrible you should break up over a moderate thingapos, I will say this is a red flag. A third commented: So you’ve been dating for four years. Are now engaged. And his mum is still uncertainyou’re right for each other  Someone  said: Itaposs such a light-hearted thing to do, surprised the joke flew over her head. Plus she wouldnapost have seen themshe hadnapost snooped apostidied.apos Maybe she is having trouble letting go of her son but silly notes arenapost cruel, theyaposre silly notes. While another added: Sheaposs snooping through your home. Iaposd have gone further and left little notes like, aposNobody likes a snoop,apos and aposYou arenapost welcome to go through my things.apos But yours were pretty damn funny.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The woman, known only as Charlotte, walked past a public park and noticed that one of the swings was moving on its own, and oddly there was no one around to have pushed it, as Dorset Live reports.She was walking her dog at the time, and at first, she thought there must have been someone in the park that she had missed, but after double-checking, she discovered it was empty. Now Charlotte is convinced that sheaposs seen the ghost of a child, still swinging in their favourite park - and admits sheaposs creeped out. Do you believe in ghosts  Let us know in the comments...Charlotte, from Dorset, said: As I was walking along, I saw this swing just keep swinging. There was no one in the park, no kids either, so it’s not assomeone had just jumped off and let it go. I noticed the swing and watched it for about - seconds. Then I stood there for about  seconds to film it, but even after I left it was still swinging. At first, it was a bit misty, but then I walked across the field and it got really misty to the point I couldnapost see in front of me. So I headed back to my car and headed towards the park when my dog started acting weird. Sometimes they say that animals can pick up these [spiritual] things and my dog was acting really weird. Normally, she runs off and wants to play, but instead she was by my side the whole time.It was like she could feel something. The mysterious incident happened on Tuesday, January , at around pm when it was particularly foggy - which only added to the spooky atmosphere. She continued: It was a bit of a creepy evening as lots of people also posted pictures of how foggy it was. It creeped me out, but not too much - I suppose it was just the little ghost of a child on the swing. I normally walk up there quite a lot but I’ve never noticed this before.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

The new legislation is a huge step forward as it means farmers and police are able to trace offending dogs’ owners and impose serious penalties.“We’re supporting the ‘Your Dog - Your Responsibility’ campaign to spread the message about the new law and encourage irresponsible dog owners to control their pets. We want people to enjoy the countryside as it’s so important for people’s wellbeing. It’s vital that dog owners act responsibly and keep dogs under control whenever there is a possibility that livestock are nearby.”.removeThe need for robust legislation was further demonstrated by an NFU Mutual survey last year which showed that % of UK dog owners let their pets roam free in the countryside, despite half admitting their dog doesn’t always come back when called."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-trio-hogg-sutherland-darcy-scotland-squad","story":"There is a strong Borders contingent in Gregor Townsend’s -man squad for the upcoming Guinness Six Nations ties.Stuart Hogg continues as captain and is joined in the squad by fellow Hawick pair Rory Sutherland and Darcy Graham.Boston born Rufus McLean who started his rugby journey with Melrose Minis is also in the squad along with ex-Melrose and Southern Knights flanker Rory Darge.Bath centre Cameron Redpath, son of ex-Scotland and Melrose scrum-half Bryan Redpath, s after missing out in recent games due to injury.The squad will meet up at Oriam on Monday  January for a training camp before reconvening the following week ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash.Scotland Head Coach Townsend said: “When you look through the squad this is the most competitive I’ve seen it in so many areas and that’s testament to the strength and depth we have.“We are able to call-up several new players into the squad such as Andy Christie, Kyle Rowe and Ben White.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"covid support for businesses","story":"With the situation changing, businesses are encouraged to keep up-to-date with support available via the Find Business Support Scotland website.#Guidance for businesses and information about the UK and Scottish Governments# financial support package is available at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice,# explained Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth.He continued: #You can search and filter the funding options and guidance available to help your business during the pandemic.#We also recommend that you sign up to email updates from FindBusiness-SupportScotland to get the latest government funding announcements.#Our local Business Gateway advisers also remain available to help business owners across the region respond and adapt.#Argyll and Bute Council#s Business Gateway has added recovery support to its existing programme of business growth assistance, helping more businesses access timely expert advice and funding to support growth or recovery from the impact of the pandemic.The Argyll and Bute Business Gateway Local Growth Accelerator Programme now includes recovery grant funding of up to £,.This is aimed at existing small- and medium-sized enterprises which are aiming either to restore their annual turnover to pre-Covid levels within three years or aiming for modest growth.The programme also continues to offer growth support, via grants and expert help, with more than  businesses in the region assisted with grant funding and  with specialist advice.The programme must close in , so business owners looking for support are encouraged to register as soon as possible at www.argyll-bute.gov.uk bglgap.The Business Gateway Local Growth Accelerator Programme, worth a total of £,, is funded by Argyll and Bute Council and the European Regional Development Fund under the -

The pristine G surface is the same as the one todays opponents play on at Starks Park. Driven by the chairman, Brian Winton, there has been exponential growth made by the Aberdeen-based Junior outfit in recent years and now they have one eye on promotion to the Highland League through the pyramid system.Whats the secret behind their success “Theres not really a secret,” says Jamie Watt, their manager who had a successful Highland League career with a number of clubs as a player, notably Cove Rangers. “We have had a core of young talent that has come through together, about five or six of them who are really exceptional players. On top of that, what I have done is added experienced boys [including former Aberdeen and Inverness midfielder Stuart Duff] who I knew were really top Highland League players. Weve had a lot of offers and a lot of teams interested but they have never left because they all love our football. We have just got stronger and stronger.”“Brian is a shrewd character and he makes it well aware thatyou wanted to buy one of these players its going to be premium money. Michael Philipson is the one the Highland League clubs all want to get. Formartine, Fraserburgh, Locos, the Aberdeenshire clubs all tell me  ever theres a chance we could get him then let us know.” Cove watched him when Paul Hartley came in. I thought Cove would have taken a punt on him but thankfully for us they never did and hes hung around. It worked well for him. Hes had four years at university with his job as an accountant. Hes still doing exams, hes comfortable with us but he has said he would like to play higher but he wanted to focus on getting his education. He is actually missing training for the next three weeks because he has got exams again. Most of the players are coming to the end of their student time and starting to get into the working world. We have actually found it a bit of a challenge: quite a few of them this year have gone into work and are on call or are missing training sessions because their work is keeping them.”It makes for a balancing act at this level. Banks Scottish Cup run almost ended before it started when Watt took a depleted team to Linlithgow Rose back in August.“It was the hardest game that we have had and we ended up getting a penalty in the last minute to get through that game,” he recalls. “We only had  available that day and we struggled to put out a team. We had wingers playing full backs by the end. Since then the confidence has been sky high. We went up to Fraserburgh in the Aberdeenshire Cup on the Tuesday, we had  players, I had three -year-olds who came up with me, my only centre half went off after seven minutes and we won that one - and I had guys all over the pitch playing out of position. That Linlithgow game showed us that we could do it. It was a huge result.”Helping Watt oversee the development of his talented squad is his co-manager Roy McBain, who succeeded long-time incumbent Tommy Forbes in the role last summer.McBain was a member of the  Inverness Caledonian side which secured promotion to the top flight, won the Challenge Cup and reached the semi-final of the Scottish Cup before losing to Dunfermline Athletic after a replay.Watt says he has tapped into McBains back catalogue of big games to help motivate his players. Co-managers are not a common sight in football but Watt, , says it works for Banks O Dee and gives his coaches flexibility over other commitments. Last weekend, he watched Rovers - defeat by Arbroath while McBain took charge of the - win over Maud, one of the benefits of sharing the managers role between them.“It worked really well with me and Tommy Forbes. The chairman just wanted to keep that dynamic when Roy came in. Its all I have been used to in management so I dont look at it any other way. I end up taking the lead, Roy is in the background. We bounce off each other. When it comes to picking the team we have our agreements and our disagreements, there have been a couple this week. But we talk it out, we sit down and most of the time I win,” he laughs.“The job [eats up] quite a bit of time: guys getting in touch, who can make training, who cant, whos injured, where theyre at, getting in touch with the physio, are they going to make the Saturday. Its me that has got to contact players. The chairman will be on the phone most days with some news to tell me. Theres always something happening. Most of this happens at training but I do find I need to take time out at work to sort things out. Im a plumber, I run my own business. If I do get held up on a job, then Roy is there to take the reins, no problem.”“The chairmans son, Josh Winton, also came on board this year as a third coach. Its the same with Roy, hes an apprentice electrician, sometimes he gets stuck away and cant make training andthats the case we have always got two coaches there.”It will be an emotional occasion at Spain Park this afternoon. On Thursday, the club buried its former secretary Tam Ewan, today his grandson will be the mascot as the teams are led out on to the pitch and there will be a minutes applause before kick off in memory of a man who served Banks O Dee in a number of roles.“You dont get many like him nowadays. There always seems to be one or two, though, who are the leblood of a club. He was just one of those guys who loved it, he couldnt wait for you to come off to speak to you about the game and his thoughts. Hopefully we can give him a nice little send off on Saturday.”What better way than with an upset that would really make Scottish football sit up and take notice of the mini-revolution taking place under Watt "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Only % Agreed.The plan unveiled by Transport Scotland to replace ferries with fixed links comes  years after the opening of the Skye bridge was mired in controversy.For decades islanders had called for a road bridge from the mainland as growing visitor numbers put a strain on the ferry that ran between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin.But the cost of the bridge’s tolls sparked outrage. Car drivers were charged up to £. each way, compared to p on the Forth Road Bridge. Protesters claimed this made the Skye crossing the most expensive road toll in Europe.Net zero, energy and transport secretary Michael Matheson has unveiled a plan that could see another crossing to Mull, which has been hit with ferry disruption. A bridge from Oban to the nearest community on Mull would be around ten miles long while a link between Fishnish on Mull and Lochaline in the Morvern area of Highland, across the sound of Mull would cover just three miles.Transport Scotland has also talks of a plan of a fixed link between North and South Uist and Lewis and Harris.Another bridge or tunnel could link Barra and the Uists.But the move has come despite the views expressed in the poll.Joe Reade, the chairman of the Mull and Iona Ferry Committee said: \"It would seem that people value their island identity.\"No-one on Mull has been publicly asking for a fixed link. We have been asking simply for more reliable and more efficient ferries, for years. Before we start thinking about tunnels under the sea, we need to fix the very urgent and fundamental problems with the ferry service.\"What they want is a reliable ferry service, one that is dependable in typical winter weather, and has space for everyone who wants to use it in the summer. These are the basic expectations of a leline ferry service, but at the moment they are not being met.\"Thinking big thoughts about the future is always healthy. We should never assume that things will always be done the way they have in the past. It is healthy to have some ambitious thinking in Transport Scotland.\"Ironically however, that is one of the major cultural and institutional problems with the current state ferry establishment – change happens at glacial pace and decisions often seem to be shaped by dogma and vested interests rather than asking what would actually deliver the best service to islanders at least cost.\"So rather than distracting us with grandiose plans for  years hence, what is really needed is a two - five year plan to fix the chronically dysal and expensive ferry system.\"It comes after Transport Scotland bought a new ferry for from MR Norled, the Norwegian shipping company, to help support the ageing leline ferry fleet this year.The vessel was on offer for just £.m. A £m deal to capture the ferry includes the price of modications.The seven-year-old vessel which carries  passengers and  cars has been earmarked for the Oban to Craignure on Mull route in the network run by Scottish Government-controlled ferry operator CalMac.It comes as the delivery of new leline island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull , which were due online in the first half of , are over five years late, with costs doubling in total to over £m.According to a transport review analysis the moves for bridges or tunnels have come as current ferry routes on the Sound of Harris, Sound of Barra and between Craignure on Mull and Oban face a \"number of issues and challenges\".It says: \"Replacing ferry services with fixed links bridges or tunnel can improve reliability, connectivity, capacity and crossing times.\"A Sound of Harris fixed link would improve connectivity between the Uists and Lewis Harris while a Sound of Barra fixed link would improve connectivity between Barra and the Uists.\"The provision of these fixed links would allow for the reconfiguration of transport provision between the Outer Hebrides and the mainland.\"The provision of a fixed link between Mull and the Scottish mainland would allow for the reconfiguration of transport provision between the island and the mainland.\"Further work is now to be undertaken on business cases to better understand the benefits, costs and challenges associated with these options.The analysis said the studies would \"consider the feasibility of replacing existing fery services\" currently delivered by CalMac as part of the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Servicescontract.The analysis added: \"These studies would also ascertain the potential savings associated with the public sector subsidies required to operate the ferry services and involve input from communities that may potentially be affected.\"But Mr Reade said people feel \"completely ignored\" when calls are made for the need for changes to improve the ferry service.\"The house is burning down and we are shouting urgently for someone to do something, and the response from Edinburgh is look at this shiny fire engine that we’ll have in  years.\"It’s the kind of top-down approach to the islands we are getting more fed up with. We’re being told what the solutions are, and rarely asked about our problems.\"I would also point out that a tunnel to Mull is by no means an easy task, and a glance at the map will tell you this.\"It is thought the most practical place to install a fixed link would be in the three miles between Fishnish on Mull and Lochaline in the Morvern area of Highland, across the sound of Mull.But Mr Read said there would still be a strong need to retain a ferry to Oban because it is Mulls closest mainland town and a local service centre, where ochildren go to school and the shortest route to central Scotland.\"A bridge to Morvern would take us to one of the most isolated mainland peninsulas, with no signicant town until Fort William after about another one-and-a-half hours drive on predominantly single-track roads,\" said Mr Reade.\"So it is dficult to imagine that the business case for a tunnel to Morvern would stack up, since there would be very few balancing cost savings in reduced ferry operations.\"The alternative tunnel – to Oban – would need to be about eight miles long and would make it the longest road tunnel in the UK by quite some margin. It is dficult to imagine that would be justied for an island of , people who at the moment show little desire for one.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman: “The draft recommendations are currently out for consultation and we would encourage island communities to respond, having already heard from them about the importance of reliable links to the Scottish mainland.\"The investigation of potential fixed links at Sounds of Harris and Barra, and between Mull and the mainland is one of  recommendations now being consulted on.  The recommendation identies that the next step would be further business case work, to better understand the socioeconomic benefits, costs and challenges associated with these options.  We will of course include the communities that may be affected by these proposals in that work.  Strategic Transport Projects Review also recommends ferry vessel renewal and replacement, progressive decarbonisation of these and the associated investment in port infrastructure.“Further work is planned within the Islands Connectivity Plan, which will replace the current Ferries Plan from January , supporting the delivery of NTSR priorities and the National Islands Plan.  Alongside further consideration of the long-term investment programme for new ferries and development at ports the Plan will undertake a ferry fares policy review alongside our wider Fair Fares review.  Following engagement and consultation in , the aim is to publish a draft Plan for consultation by the end of the year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmUPDATED An emergency towing vessel has been sent to the location of a tanker which has broken down in the Pentland Firth.

It makes us feel a little bit more at ease than planning for conditions that we might not go in as one of the favourites.“It makes us feel a little bit comfortable, we know what works in Australia.” vw,vw,px, px\"Eoin Morgan is no stranger to lting a World Cup England’s next T World Cup cycle starts with a series against the West Indies – where all five matches will be held at Barbados’ Kensington Oval – with Saturday’s opener just six days after the conclusion of the Ashes.With Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan and Ben Stokes among the absentees in Bridgetown because of their exertions in Australia, there are opportunities for those who have been on the periphery of squads in recent years.Liam Livingstone will miss out because of an illness not related to Covid but Sam Billings is in contention. It was initially thought he would be unavailable for this weekend’s double-header after answering England’s SOS for the last Ashes Test but the early finish in Hobart has allowed him to get to the Caribbean with time to spare.George Garton could make his international bow after being one of a number of this -strong largely inexperienced England squad to cut short stints in the Big Bash – which Morgan insisted was the right approach. vw,vw,px, px\"George Garton could make his England debut When it was put to England’s limited-overs captain that playing in the Big Bash might represent better preparation with the T World Cup in mind, Morgan replied: “This takes guys out of their comfort zone a lot more.“Unless they play in finals or games that go to the wire in the Big Bash,I would agree with you but not many have been close games.“Here will take them out of their comfort zone because West Indies are a very talented side. They bat to number  so they will take us out of the comfort zone.“I think the whole tour, this one, is one where the development of our game is actually more important than the series win.”Paul Collingwood, who captained England to their first global trophy at this very ground in the  World Twenty, is overseeing the group as beleaguered head coach Chris Silverwood takes a breather. vw,vw,px, px\"Paul Collingwood, left, deputises for the under-pressure Chris Silverwood in the Caribbean Silverwood’s position seems to be under threat following England’s abject - defeat in the Ashes but Morgan revealed he has enjoyed working with the Yorkshireman in the two years he has been in charge.“I have been fortunate enough to see both sides of him, as a player and a coach,” Morgan added.“He’s been brilliant to work with.

After an -minute delay while the lights flickered on briefly, referee Mike Dean allowed play to continue without the full lights.The result ensures the Hornets remain without a win since their shock - triumph over Manchester United in November, but have only now slipped into the relegation zone for the first time this season.The club, though, do not have a history of sticking with under-pressure managers and it could be a crucial week for Claudio Ranieri, who described the match beforehand as a “cup final”. vw,vw,px, px\"A partial floodlight failure delayed the game in the second half The pre-match pyrotechnics including fireworks and flames built the atmosphere but there were no chances of note until the th minute, when Rashica curled a ball from Sargent just over the Watford goal.Just before half-time, Dennis wove his way into the box and went down in search of a penalty rather than trying to pick out an unmarked Joao Pedro.Watford had a chance at the start of the second half when Pedro was found by Sissoko, but his strike was over Angus Gunn’s goal.Out of an innocuous opportunity, Norwich took the lead with a clever back-heeled flick from Sargent for his first goal for the Canaries.Teemu Pukki shook off Samir in the build up, which VAR checked before allowing the goal to stand, before playing the ball into the centre of the box where Sargent stuck out his leg behind him and the ball rebounded off the crossbar and over the line. vw,vw,px, px\"Josh Sargent, left, gives Norwich the lead with an improvised finish The goalscorer then headed a Rashica cross past Bachmann for his side’s second of the game in the th minute.Dennis’ second yellow left his side at a numerical disadvantage and Norwich were able to cap off their match with a Kucka own goal to leave with a - victory, the first time they have scored three in the Premier League this season.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They will be reviewed at that point, by which time all children aged five to  will have had the opportunity to be vaccinated.Taoiseach Mr Martin warned that the coronavirus pandemic is not over.But he added: “Spring is coming.

It draws tens of thousands of spectators in its stands and tens of millions watch from home.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are in communication with the Russian government.”It comes after Downing Street warned Russia would be “punished”the country pushes ahead with any “destabilising action” in Ukraine.US secretary of state Antony Blinken held talks with Russian diplomats in Switzerland on Friday in a bid to avert a conflict on Ukraine’s border, where Moscow has amassed an estimated , troops.Number  saidRussian president Vladimir Putin launches an offensive, there will be a “package of sweeping measures” launched by the UK and its allies against the Kremlin.Earlier, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned Mr Putin he must “desist and step back” from war in Ukraine or risk being dragged into a prolonged conflict like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Speaking at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, she said: “If there is an incursion by Russia into Ukraine, it would come at a massive cost.“We are prepared to put very severe sanctions in place, we are also working to support Ukraine in terms of defensive capability.”A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: “I think the Prime Minister has been clear that any destabilising action by Russia in Ukraine would be a strategic mistake and would have signicant consequences.“I’ve talked about the fact that we’re working closely with our partners, including the US, to draw up a package of sweeping measures to make sure that the Russian government is punishedit crosses the line.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Meanwhile, another two deaths linked to the virus were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday and a further , positive cases.The easing of Covid- restrictions included:  From Friday, the removal of table service and the requirement to be seated in hospitality venues, Guidance regarding the number of households meeting indoors was scrapped, The requirement to provide proof of face mask exemption is no longer necessary and guidance on working from home was changed to “working from home where you can”, The self-isolation period was also reduced to five days, depending on negative lateral flow test results, From Wednesday, nightclubs can reopen, and dancing and indoor events can resume, Nightclubs and events with more than  people must continue to check for Covid-status certicates, but it is no longer necessary in pubs and restaurants and Offices no longer need to implement two-metre social distancing.Speaking during Thursday’s announcement, Mr Givan said he was “delighted” at the decisions taken by the Executive.“The February  date will be an important meeting now for those outstanding measures that are still in place,” he added.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said it was a “good day and hopeful day” but urged a note of caution and continued to advise the public to take up the offer of a vaccine.Publicans were thrilled with the easing of the restrictions as the industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic.Belfast publican Pedro Donald, who owns the Sunflower Bar on Union Street and The American Bar at the docks, said it was “absolutely fantastic news”.“The costs have gone up because we’ve needed extra staff to do the door and do the table service, but the income has gone down,” he said. “It’s been a disaster so it is such a relief.”The owner of Belfast city pub Bittles Bar, John Bittles, was relieved to see the end of Covid- certication, as checking everything from mobile apps to PCR test results had proved to be a dficult task.“It’s January, you have bills to pay, you’ve staff to pay so I think the general consensus is we’re really glad to see it but I think for the sake of a week, they should have lted the Covid passport as well,” said Mr Bittles.General manager of Moira’s Pretty Mary’s, Joe Webb, was glad to see theof dancing in venues as it will allow the Co Down pub to bring back its popular live music evenings.“There was no point in having music on unless people could dance,” said Mr Webb. “Its definitely a very welcome step forward for the industry.”Elsewhere, Belfast’s DJ Tez told Evening Extra that the Executive must explain why nightclubs need to continue to ask for Covid- certication.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDepartment of HealthPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillMore On The Executive Office PremiumCovid: it isn’t going away you knowGivan ready to abandon Covid passport

Andrew MaddenTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast city councillors have voted not to fly the Union flag at City Hall next month to mark embattled Prince Andrews birthday.It comes amid the fallout from the duke#s civil sex assault case, after a judge ruled earlier this month that Virginia Giuffre#s lawsuit against him should proceed.Ms Giuffre alleges Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.Read MoreRelief in Portrush as duke stripped of title at famous golf club amid sex caseUnder current rules, the Union flag is flown at Belfast City Hall on a number of designated days each year, set by the UK Government#s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport .Alliance councillor Nuala McAllister said her party have contacted DCMS proposing to remove Prince Andrew’s birthday from the designated list – instead proposing July  is added to mark the Battle of the Somme in its place.The flag was due to be flown on the building on February , the duke#s nd birthday, however SDLP councillor Donal Lyons proposed, given the controversy, that this should not go ahead.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Speaking during a meeting of Belfast City Council#s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee on Friday morning, Mr Lyons said the issue of flags in Belfast has been contentious in the past, however his proposals were not in this vein and not about issues relating to national identity, rather it was a question of what is right and what is wrong.Everyone, of course, is entitled to due process - but having a flag flown in your honour is not an entitlement, it#s a privilege, he said.We#ve seen schools, other councils, and even the Royal Family take steps to distance themselves from this situation. I#m not going to comment on the allegations facing Prince Andrew, they are well documented and widely known, but what I will say is how you make your argument reflects on your character.In a sexual assault case, to cast up ideas of gold-digging or paydays being sought, to suggest photographic evidence has been doctored, or to throw up terms like # memory# and seek to bring in health experts to claim constitutional protection and to seek to portray a victim as some sort of perpetrator - it#s nothing short of disgraceful and sends an appalling message to women and girls everywhere.I propose that we don#t proceed with the flying of the flag on the th of February, and in lieu of that discussions should take place among party group leaders to find a more less disagreeable occasion.DUP council group leader Brian Kingston, on the other hand, said his party would be opposing the proposal.The position of the DUP councillors is that we should abide by our policy to abide by the days designated by the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport at Westminster,” he said.We are certainly not blind to the allegations of gross misconduct against Prince Andrew and we share in the deep concern about these allegations, but we should await the outcome of the trial.The proposals were passed by a vote, with only the DUP members of the committee voting against.It comes after the Queen stripped the duke of his royal patronages, which saw him lose his honorary titles at Royal Portrush, Royal Belfast and Royal County Down golf clubs.Prince Andrew visited Royal Portrush when it hosted The Open back in  and later ed to the course to play a round later that year. A long-standing patron of the club, he opened its new clubhouse in .Virginia Giuffre claims she was trafficked by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was -years-old and a minor under United States law.The duke has repeatedly denied the allegations.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilSDLPMore On Belfast City CouncilHundreds back call to restore Belfast’s Wilmont House to former gloryBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelRegister for animal cruelty offenders is a step closer, says Poots PremiumJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fund PremiumViewpointOpinionIt’s worth travelling along green routeMost ReadWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageSDLP leader considering motion to scrap deputy First Minister titleDead man ‘propped up by two other men in attempt to collect pension at Carlow post office’Luxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughAll Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayRelaxation of Covid- restrictions agreed by Northern Ireland ExecutivePlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeSuzanne BreenOpinionStruggling DUP will have to claw its way back to top was Northern Ireland’s darkest year: ‘There was a bomb, then another… Chunks of the city fell apart around us’Ex-council chair ‘made huge contribution to Banbridge community’‘Left field, fascinating’: NI music industry figures hail unlikely superstar Meat LoafLatestThe holidays we’ll all be wanting to book in , by NI travel expertsSister of Belfast star Jude is also making waves on big screenGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeSuzanne BreenOpinionStruggling DUP will have to claw its way back to topRussian minister accepts invitation to meet with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Ariadna De Raadt FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMost signicant is the absence of a woman minister on this year’s list. Credit: Ariadna De RaadtJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA seasoned observer of Presbyterian Moderatoral elections will notice several important points about this year’s list.All four candidates are ministers in rural areas - from Portrush, Larne, Kilrea and Richhill. Usually there is at least one from the greater Belfast area or the main centres of population.Read MoreNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedSecondly there are no candidates from across the Border, even though every Moderator represents the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.There are lively Presbyteries in the Republic who might be expected to put forward a candidate, but their reluctance to do so may be because the current Moderator, the Rt Revd Dr Bruce, has spent a large part of his career ministering across the border.It is also interesting that only four ministers allowed their names to go forward this year, though there were greater numbers in some years past. This may be a coincidence, or it may be because fewer ministers want to shoulder the challenges of a high public profile which every Moderator faces, and particularly in these years when the PCI is involved in continued controversy about its policy on same-sex issues.Most signicant is the absence of a woman minister on this year’s list. The PCI has been constantly criticised for its failure to elect a female Moderator.Ironically it was the first main Reformed Church in Ireland to ordain a woman minister – the Reverend Ruth Patterson. Since then she stood twice, unsuccessfully, for the Moderatorship and on her second attempt she received not a single vote from any of the  Presbyteries.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up More recently the Reverend Dr Elizabeth Hughes, formerly of Whitehouse Presbyterian, was runner-up in the election for Moderator but when she ran again the next year she was down the list.Perhaps women ministers are longer willing to put themselves forward with seemingly so little chance of success.Whatever the reason, it is extraordinary that in this age of gender equality, the PCI is still unable or unwilling to elect a female leader. Sadly, it remains the only major Reformed church in Ireland not to do so.Most ReadWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageSDLP leader considering motion to scrap deputy First Minister titleDead man ‘propped up by two other men in attempt to collect pension at Carlow post office’Luxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughAll Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayRelaxation of Covid- restrictions agreed by Northern Ireland ExecutivePlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern Ireland was Northern Ireland’s darkest year: ‘There was a bomb, then another… Chunks of the city fell apart around us’Ex-council chair ‘made huge contribution to Banbridge community’‘Left field, fascinating’: NI music industry figures hail unlikely superstar Meat LoafPublic split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsBelfastQuiz of the WeekLatest‘Mindfulness’ monk Thich Nhat Hanh dies aged Rio de Janeiro delays Carnival due to surging Covid casesMajority of Covid restrictions lt in IrelandNew York police officer fatally shot during domestic disturbance callSam McBrideOpinionSecrecy and power: What Sue Gray’s two NI sojourns reveal about her,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Most people wouldn’t mindthey’re doing exactly the same work as a colleague in an office or a factory, they’re not going to get worried about titles.”He added that he would support Mr Eastwood’s plans to scrap the deputy First Minister title to “take the energy out of it”.The last thing we want on the other side of an Assembly election in May is for the two largest parties to be at each others throats just because of a silly title.”More pressing issues, he said, included tackling a housing crisis, hospital beds and investment west of the River Bann in Northern Ireland.The issue, he said, had also shown “a strategic weakness” in unionism that considered that a unionist vote had more value than a nationalist.Most ReadWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageSDLP leader considering motion to scrap deputy First Minister titleDead man ‘propped up by two other men in attempt to collect pension at Carlow post office’All Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayRelaxation of Covid- restrictions agreed by Northern Ireland ExecutiveLatest Northern Ireland was Northern Ireland’s darkest year: ‘There was a bomb, then another… Chunks of the city fell apart around us’Ex-council chair ‘made huge contribution to Banbridge community’‘Left field, fascinating’: NI music industry figures hail unlikely superstar Meat LoafPublic split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsBelfastQuiz of the WeekLatest‘Mindfulness’ monk Thich Nhat Hanh dies aged Rio de Janeiro delays Carnival due to surging Covid casesMajority of Covid restrictions lt in IrelandNew York police officer fatally shot during domestic disturbance callSam McBrideOpinionSecrecy and power: What Sue Gray’s two NI sojourns reveal about her,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

So far the youths have engaged in wanton vandalism of ious areas of the village including putting dog faeces through letter boxes and damaging the villagersquos Christmas tree and festive lights last month.The RUC says it is vital that members of the public provide information which will bring an end of the vandalism problem.ldquoWe need the help of the community to bring those responsible to court, and without that help it will be very dficult to put an end to this problem, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Management at the GPT telecommunications plant in Ballynahinch have pledged to work towards ensuring that it continues to have a future following the weekend announcement of  redundancies.The company, which manufactures hi-tech switching equipment for the telecommunications industry, revealed on Friday that it is to slice its workforce by more than half.The job losses will reduce the workforce at the Antrim Road plant to .

The only good news is that we will not be closing and are hoping that a leaner and fitter plant can be a springboard for the future, said Mr OrsquoNeill.DRUMANESS ndash Around forty villagers from Drumaness rolled up their sleeves on Sunday to give the local mill pond a much-needed clean-up.The Friends of Drumaness Dam group pulled a large quantity of rubbish out of the pond in the first of a series of work days aimed at improving the area.Fallen branches which had been washed into the dam were removed with the aid of ropes, while rubbish dumped in the centre of the pond was removed by boat. The branches were burnt on a bonfire, and all plastic collected was taken to Drumnakelly dump for safe disposal.Among the workers who took part in the work day was Mrs Sheila Lewis-Crosby, who along with her husband John is the owner of the mill pond. She and Drumaness woman Mrs Carmel Mason cleared brambles constructing a path alongside the dam.After the clean-up, the secretary of the Friends of Drumaness, Dam Lisa Fagan, congratulated the volunteers and thanked local councillor Patsy Toman for initiating the venture.ldquoThe Drumaness people can be proud of our achievement here today, she said. ldquoThere is no doubt that the whole community is sickened by these incidents, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash People who take part in the after-dark practice of ldquolamping rabbits have this week been warned they are placing themselves in danger.The RUC has warned that people who dress up in combat clothing and walk around fields hunting rabbits with firearms could find themselves being confronted by a security force patrol.Over the Christmas and New Year period, the RUC received reports of ldquolamping in the Downpatrick and Crossgar areas and it also believed to have occurred around Saintfield.The practice has been a problem in the Castlewellan area for a number of years but it is relatively unknown in east Down.It involves hunters going into fields without farmersrsquo permission and shooting rabbits by torchlight. Rabbits instinctively freeze when caught in a beam of light making them sitting targets for anyone with a shotgun.However, the sudden spread of the problem has alarmed the RUC which is appealing for people not to take part in what is regarded as a ldquohighly dangerous occupation.COMBER ndash Plans for the second stage of the Comber by-pass have been postponed for four years, it has been revealed.Strangford Ulster Unionist MP, Mr John Taylor, said he has been informed of the decision which he says has left him ldquoshell-shocked.ldquoTogether with local councillors and Comber businessmen I have been campaigning for many years to get the by-pass built. It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying.

It has been highly infectious but has had minor health impacts.This is a time to celebrate the success of the vaccine programme, above all in the United Kingdom — a country of which we are lucky to be a part given that is a global scientic leader and played a key role in developing the medications.It is also a time to recognise the way in which the great bulk of people have, cheerfully enough, adapted to the new considerate ways of living in a pandemic.This experience will almost certainly help us to respond much more quickly to any future viral outbreak. Many people, for example, will want to continue to wear masks even when they cease to be mandatory.It might yet be that there is fresh, more dangerous outbreak of Covid. But we can no longer put le on hold due to that possibility.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand the wider Catholic school community are extremely concerned at the choice of words used by UUP leader Doug Beattie MLA when he declared the “need to end educational apartheid”.[In a press release last Friday he had declared: “We need to end educational apartheid which is taking place here. We need a single education system in Northern Ireland that allows them to do that.”]Catholic schools and many others across the education sector firmly reject the use of this inflammatory language as they work tirelessly to promote a shared educational landscape.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.CCMS categorically rejects the very idea that Catholic schools are isive or that they stand in opposition to an inclusive and erse education system.Catholic schools promote the dignity and worth of every human person the purpose and value of education the relationship between education, family, and the local community and the purpose and meaning of le itself.The terminology used by Mr Beattie is not helpful and is representative of the misconception that schools that do not have an integrated status are not welcoming and inclusive, particularly given the long-standing work that has gone on in not only Catholic schools but rather all schools to promote shared education. The one-dimensional and isive ‘segregated VS integrated’ dichotomy suggests that there is only one way forward, namely making all schools ‘integrated’.There is in fact a wide spectrum of approaches to break down barriers, end ision and promote a unied, strong society. Catholic schools and others continue to work together to realise this ideal.I would welcome the opportunity to share with Mr Beattie the context of Catholic schools in Northern Ireland, their vision and purpose and the important role that Catholic schools exercise in educating and enriching the lives of everyone in their host communities.Equally, I would encourage Mr Beattie to discuss with both myself and colleagues across the education sector the positive changes that many governors, principals, staff, children, and young people have cultivated in their communities through shared education programmes and partnerships across Northern Ireland.Catholic schools firmly believe that no child should be left behind.Our vision is to enable all young people to meet their full potential, through access to a high-quality education irrespective of location, socio-economic background, ability, or gender.Catholic schools wish to cultivate an education system which guarantees all children will be equally supported to fulfil their potential.The challenge for all of us is to build a fair and respectful society. Education and all of our schools have a very important role to play in progressing this vision – maintained, controlled, integrated, Irish medium and grammar.However, this can only workwe all continue to work together and in this regard the label of educational apartheid is extremely unhelpful.– Gerry Campbell is Chief Executive of CCMSMore from the News Letter: Click here: Higgins in spotlight over political neutrality ahead of major Bloody Sunday event following ‘sectarian NI state’ comments from organisers Click here: VIDEO: Move to rename Prince Andrew Way – one of four such roads in Northern Ireland – as mother shreds his royal status Click here: VIDEO: The most stunning photos of Northern Ireland from the air – as taken by the PSNI helicopter squad over the last year Click here: WATCH: Odd speech by chief NI Protocol negotiator Liz Truss shows her enraged by imported cheese but overjoyed at pork marketsA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Credit : Rob Youngson   Focus FeaturesThe film starts with the jollity of a tight-knit terraced neighbourhood being shattered by a riot intended to intimidate Catholics into moving out.Given the starting point, the threat of violence looms large for the entire film but it is not a well which Branagh taps too often. Instead he celebrates togetherness rather than ision, helped by a stand-out cast including Ciaran Hinds, Judi Dench, Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan.There are bits of dialogue reminiscent of the Derry Girls scene listing the dferences between the two religions that bring a chuckle.For example when Buddy, who doesn’t want to go to church, points out: “But Daddywe were Catholics we could not go to church, then every once in a wee while we could do it and confess. And then they’d have to tell us we were forgiven and we wouldn’t have to go in again for ages.”The film does have a certain feel-good factor which belies its backdrop. Ultimately, it could mean that Branagh’s heartwarming story, aided by an uplting soundtrack from Belfast’s own Van Morrison, is better received internationally rather than locally, where we’ve grown accustomed to expecting the worst to happen.Whether you’re watching the film in Belfast, Beirut or Boston it is hard to find fault in the film’s visual integrity – its wonderful black and white imagery is captivating on the silver screen.The often dark Northern Irish sense of humour is also given a good showcase, like when Buddy is trying to solve a mathematical problem with his granddad who tells him to make his numbers indistinct so his teacher will give him the benefit of the doubt.“But there’s only one right answer,” says Buddy.His Pop replies: “If that were true, son, people wouldn’t be blowing themselves up all across town.”• Belfast opens in the UK on Friday, January , though some special screenings of the film are taking place in Belfast this evening ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Wednesdays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"key date ahead as all restrictions to be reviewed ","story":"Work starts on £m hotel plan at former military base   DUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeople‘Key date’ ahead as ‘all restrictions’ to be reviewedThe next Stormont Executive meeting could be a “key date” as Northern Ireland hopes to move out of the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.By Niall DeeneySaturday, nd January , : amUpdated Saturday, nd January , : am  \"       \"  He was looking ahead to the next meeting on February , after the Executive agreed to remove several of the restrictions still in place when it met on Thursday.Following that meeting, a spokesperson for the Executive Office at Stormont confirmed that “all remaining covid measures will be reviewed” on February .While Mr Swann has sounded a note of cautious optimism, it is far from certain the remaining restrictions will be dispensed with when the Executive meets again in under three weeks.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A number of restrictions were changed including the ending of table service only in pubs and restaurants. Jade Dawson and Lydia Hope, who are on holiday from England, enjoy a drink in the DuKe of York in Belfast City Centre. Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeThe News Letter has spoken to several members of the Stormont health committee, from a range of parties, who expressed caution when it comes to the lting of remaining rules.The Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw said it would be “unrealistic” to assume all remaining rules will be dropped so soon.Mr Swann’s UUP colleague, Alan Chambers, said he is “reluctant to read too much into” the announcement that all remaining restrictions would soon be reviewed.The DUP’s Deborah Erskine, however, urged ministers to remember that coronavirus restrictions are only to be kept in place as long as they are deemed “absolutely necessary”.Minister for Health Robin SwannMr Swann, meanwhile, spoke to the media in Antrim after a swathe of restrictions were relaxed, including an end to the legal requirement for Covid certication to enter some hospitality venues, and the reopening of nightclubs. “I have always taken the decision at the time in regards to the advice that was put forward via my chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser, so February , while it will be a key date, let’s make sure we get there safely and as collectively as we can,” he said.“I would still encourage people to follow the guidance, follow the regulations that are still in place and take the opportunities to come forward and get their vaccines and their boosters.“There are three weeks to go and I want to keep the trajectory of this virus going in the same direction as it has been, and that’s downwards.”Ms Bradshaw, speaking to the News Letter, said: “Everything, at every stage, of every Executive meeting has been reviewed and looked at so I think it’s unrealistic to assume that there will certainly be this huge lting of remaining restrictions as there has been in England.“I don’t think we will see them go away as quickly as the announcement of that date would suggest. “We are still getting , cases per day. I think that, obviously, there is less death but there are still people dying every day and there are still a lot of people on ventillators fighting for their lives. “We are certainly not out of the woods yet.”Mr Chambers said: “It’s not unusual that the Executive are going to review all restrictions in early February. “I’m reluctant to read too much into it, because at every Executive meeting everything is under review. “There isn’t anything unusual about that, and I wouldn’t read too much into ‘nudge, nudge, wink, wink’ suggestions that have been coming from some members of the Executive.“Yes, everything will be considered, but it will absolutely depend on the scientic and medical advice. Now, we all want to see normality and we want to get back to the things we had taken for granted.“Everything is always on the table. There’s a Covid taskforce that reports and it reports at every Executive meeting, as would the chief medical officer and thechief scientic advisor.”He added: “We [the UUP] follow and support the medical and scientic advice. We do not lobby for a particular thing to happen.”Ms Erskine said: “Decisions taken by the Executive need to be evidence based, targeted and effective. “There has always been a duty on ministers to ensure that restrictions are in place for no longer than is absolutely necessary. “When decisions are next taken on February  that must be the guiding principle again.“As we hopefully see the medical threat from Covid- continue to reduce, there must also be a renewed focus on the economic impact of restrictions and how we can best support businesses refocus and rebuild.”Robin SwannStormont ExecutiveNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border Murder of Sir Norman Stronge recalled on anniversary of ‘barbarous’ IRA attackTwo points Michelle O’Neill overlooks about violence and misogynyRussian muscle may give Boris the leline he desperately needs – and make it an ideal time to focus on the ProtocolDUP under fire for supporting flag-flying on Prince Andrew’s birthday for the time being – whilst veteran UUP man backs this stanceMost PopularBest electric heaters UK: portable electric, ceramic, and fan heaters from Dimplex, De’Longhi, SilentnightThoughtful gts for new parents: pampering hampers, food kits, comforters, cosy throws and moreInk cartridges: how to save money on printer ink cartridge and toner - including HP, Canon and Epson printersBest bread makers - tried and tested, from Panasonic, Morphy Richards, and LakelandBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, Simba, Nectar, Eve, Dreamcloud and OTTY                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Can I urge the Prime Minister to listen to the majority and ask him not to move the government amendment in the other place later today ”Mr Johnson replied: “I am advised that... the amendment in question is going to be withdrawn.”Following the announcement, Sir Jeffrey said: “I haven’t spoken to the government about this so you will have to ask them their rationale. I’m not angry at all – I’m full of energy. I’m focussed on the job that I have, I count it an honour and a privilege to represent the people of my constituency.”“We felt that the amendment offered an opportunity, perhaps for a small number of senior representatives to continue to have a voice at Westminster while we aretrying to resolve issues such as the [NI] Protocol. But... I am looking forward to the Assembly elections,” he told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme.Sorcha Eastwood, an Alliance Assembly in Lagan Valley, described the government’s rethink as “a good day for democracy,” and added: “It is up to the DUP to now recommit to the Assembly, and make sure that we get on with the jobs that we are elected to do – that means holding one mandate at a time.”If Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey is elected to Stormont in May, Ms Eastwood could well be the Alliance candidate to contesting the resulting Westminster by-election that would now have to take place.The DUP has two sitting MLAs in the constituency – First Minister Paul Givan and Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
