In it, she reads from her essay Portrait of Diego, which was taken from the catalogue of a 1949 exhibition at the Palace of Fine Arts, celebrating 50 years of Rivera’s work.“He is a gigantic, immense child, with a friendly face and a sad gaze,” she says, as translated by Agence France-Presse. (A different English translation of the text can be found on Google Arts \u0026amp Culture.)“His high, dark, extremely intelligent and big eyes rarely hold still. They almost come out of their sockets because of their swollen and protuberant eyelids – like a toad’s. They allow his gaze to take in a much wider visual field, as if they were built especially for a painter of large spaces and crowds.”It is estimated that the recording was made in 1953 or 1954.In the press release, Mexico’s secretary of culture, Alejandra Frausto, said if it is indeed Kahlo’s voice – a claim which authorities continue to investigate – it could be the only audio recording of the artist that exists.The library’s role is to preserve and make public documentary sound archives for Mexico. Its collection, amassed over a decade, features the voices of some of the country’s most important historical figures – but library national director Pável Granados said Kahlo’s voice was the “most requested and sought-after” by visitors.“Frida’s voice has always been a great enigma, a never-ending search,” Granados told a press conference. “Until now, there had never been a recording of Frida Kahlo.”The radio show the recording was taken from, El Bachiller, was named for its host Álvaro Gálvez y Fuentes “El Bachiller”, who has been described by the ministry of culture as “the main documentalist of the voices of his time”.The sound library has 1,300 El Bachiller tapes among its collection, which will need to be digitised and cataloged in order to ascertain if more of Kahlo’s voice is among them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1125f8ed90873b20993a6ccdaaf274819ed718/0_392_4846_2907/master/4846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c77bb9d0a65c6ee0791448bdf2f8935","title":"revolution latin american photography in pictures","story":"From the photos by Alberto Korda that helped canonise Che Guevara to snatched street images of resistance, new show Urban Impulses embraces a turbulent half-century of revolvers and rebellion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/769f8033b8e1208caa6d666822a55d1cf5f5ad72/49_0_5288_3174/master/5288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5da377737aa9b7aa59993e6d1adcf67","title":"insta australia the 10 most beautiful backdrops in the northern territory","story":"Discover desert monoliths, towering waterfalls, crystal-clear swimming holes and ancient Indigenous Australian art galleries – all primed for a photoshoot – in Australia’s epic Northern TerritorySunset at Mindil beachMany visits to the Northern Territory (NT) start with a flight into capital city Darwin, lauded for its neon sunsets and market scene. Combine both at Mindil Beach Sunset Market, which buzzes with live music, crafts and food – all locally made. For the ultimate Mindil evening, Flight Centre’s Amber Farley recommends the market’s “Asian-inspired snacks and sorbets, then picnic at a film screening”. Feeling still more daring? Order a “roadkill burger”, made with kangaroo, buffalo or crocodile, before heading to the beach for a piña colada-coloured sunset.An Indigenous Australian art site with sweeping views over Arnhem Land, Ubirr is one of the most untouched and spiritually significant swathes of land in Australia. Visit the Rainbow Serpent – an Indigenous Australian creation story character believed to have painted her own image here as she snaked through the region – then climb to the site’s highest spot for a seductive sunrise and sunset views of Kakadu’s “stone country”. “The rolling plains look like they are glowing and the birdsong is hypnotic,” says Farley.Farther south, Kakadu’s dry land becomes a water-filled oasis, and Yellow Water billabong is a wildlife photographer’s dream. Lily pads float on its surface and paperbark trees rise up through its waters, as saltwater crocodiles bask on its banks and giant sea eagles and colourful kingfishers flit above it. Take a cruise with an Indigenous Australian guide in the early morning or evening to seek out the best snaps.Nitmiluk national park’s network of 13 gorges features soaring red and craggy cliffs rising above teal-toned waters. The freshwater crocodiles that lurk beneath are far less deadly than their salty cousins, making this a glorious canoeing spot. One tucked-away treasure you shouldn’t skip is the Southern Rockhole, an emerald-coloured waterfall-fed swimming hole. “Whether you are a first time traveller or a returning fan, this nature spot is one that keeps on giving,” says Flight Centre’s Farley.Wangi Falls, in Litchfield national park, robs many visitors of their breath. An arcing stretch of foliage-infused rock hosts two water streams that tumble from up to 85 metres into a glistening swimming hole. To reach the top, follow the walking trail, looping past trees loaded with flying foxes. “Take some meat, bread and utensils with you, and make use of the area’s BBQ facilities to extend your stay in this beautiful environment,” says Flight Centre’s Farley.A traditional Anangu dreaming site, this behemoth redheaded rock is taller than the Eiffel Tower and takes a cool three and a half hours to walk around. As the sun rises and falls over “The Rock”, the surfaces shift colours – from red and orange, through to maroon and purple – making Uluru a clear contender for Best Australian Backdrop, full stop.Ninety miles east of Uluru lies imposter rock “Fool-uru”. Travellers driving from Alice Springs often mistake this monolith – almost equal in size to Uluru – for the real deal. In fact, flat-topped Mount Conner is private property – so you’ll have to book a tour to visit – but those who do so will be rewarded with a lot more than a poor man’s Uluru. Conner’s striking horseshoe inselberg overlooks seven salt lakes and 1,500-head of cattle. “It’s a chance to step away from the crowds and learn about what this vast part of Australia can offer,” says Farley, who recommends rounding the visit off with a three-course home-cooked meal and a glass of fizz at the cattle station.Travellers with time for desert hopping would be mad to miss Kings Canyon, a sprawling wonderland of dome-like rocks, pink cliffs, abundant bird life and bursts of flora. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was filmed here, and the area was once entirely underwater, so keep your eyes peeled for stone paths imprinted with marine fossils. “The Garden of Eden”, a cycad-filled gully, is another highlight.A sacred site for the Indigenous Australian Arrernte women, this dramatic red corridor owes its existence to a tributary that once flowed through sandstone to meet the Finke River. Visit at midday for the best light – and venture beyond the chasm for views of the mountain ranges and a pretty walking path, lined with lush bushland.Picture-perfect swimming spot Ellery Creek Big Hole, 50 miles from Alice Springs, cuts through a gorge in the West MacDonnell Ranges. The scenery en route from Alice recalls the paintings of mid-century Indigenous Australian artist Albert Namatjira: expanses of ochre soil, soft green eucalyptus and skies ribbed in royal blue.With so many things to see, do and capture on camera, you might need a little help squeezing everything into your Aus adventure.

Alabama’s near-total ban on abortion has left her fearing the worst: “I still can’t fully believe it, to tell you the truth. The extremity of it is shocking. It’s everything – it’s rape or incest. I can’t believe that we’re here again.”When the impossible keeps happening, it can feel disorienting and overwhelming: “It’s like, what is up and what is down? … It’s like you’re living in a world that’s been turned.”The world is similarly off kilter in Ramos’s debut novel, The Farm, which imagines a luxury service that provides rich clients with surrogate mothers, confining the surrogates to a five-star country retreat during pregnancy.“I thought of it as where we are today, but pushed forward just a few inches,” she says – just enough to make people feel a little uneasy, but close enough that readers would need to ask themselves how much of it is real. “I didn’t want it to feel like sci-fi, so people would say, ‘Oh, that would never happen.’ In fact, the one thing I hope people don’t say afterwards is, ‘That could never happen.’ I hope people are like, ‘Woah! Is this happening? Is it real?’ Because it’s where we are.” A novel that examines immigration, inequality and the control women have over their own bodies feels all too urgent, she adds. “It’s a statement of how extreme things have gotten that this book should feel timely.”The Farm circles around questions of money, race and power with the story of a young Filipina, Jane, who signs up to become a surrogate mother. The fee for carrying the baby safely to term would be enough to change her life, taking her out of the dormitory in Queens where she lives with her six-month-old daughter and setting them up in their own apartment. But no children are allowed at Golden Oaks, so during her nine-month stay, Jane must leave her daughter in the care of an older friend, Evelyn.Cocooned in an unfamiliar existence of quinoa salads, exercise classes and constant surveillance, Jane becomes steadily more uneasy about the child she has left behind, and more suspicious of the regime under which she is living. As her pregnancy progresses, an awkward friendship develops between Jane and her roommate Reagan, who is a “Premium Host” – a rarity among the predominantly African American and Filipina surrogates because she is pretty, white and a summa cum laude graduate. On the other side is Mae, a Chinese-American Harvard Business School graduate who runs Golden Oaks, making sure the wealthy clients are happy by keeping the hosts on the tightest of leashes. As a true believer in the value of free trade, Mae is convinced that the contract between her rich clients and the poor surrogates is good for both sides. But can the underprivileged women under her care ever make a choice that is truly free?Ramos took no notice of the usual advice for first-time authors to write what they know, opting to follow a Meg Wolitzer suggestion: “Write what obsesses you.” But the parallels between her characters and her own life are uncanny – like Jane and Evelyn, Ramos was born in the Philippines, and like Mae, she studied at an Ivy League college. While she may embody the success her characters are chasing, the author is much more ambivalent about the American dream.Born in 1973 in Manila, Ramos moved to Wisconsin when she was six years old. Her father, a cleaning supplies salesman, got a transfer to Racine. Every weekend after church they’d visit her dad’s family, who lived at the heart of Milwaukee’s small Filipino community. “That was very much where I got a sense of what it means to be part of a big, clamorous Filipino family because we were always together,” she says. “It was warm, loud, with a lot of questions, some of them nosey, and a lot of love.”A promising student, Ramos was encouraged to apply for some of the US’s most prestigious colleges. It was only when she began studying political science at Princeton that Ramos began her education in wealth and privilege. “The rich kids in our town were the doctors’ kids – they got cars on their 16th birthday, that’s what I knew. But at Princeton I met people who had never had summer jobs and it was a given that they didn’t need to work.” At one of the first parties she went to, another student asked what her father did. “I thought I’d heard them wrong because no one had ever asked me that before. Because they don’t know my dad, so why would they give a shit what my dad did, right?” She laughs. “I said, ‘Well, he sells floor wax.’ And I say this jokingly, but it did make me feel very intimidated and pretty small.”After graduating with a ton of debt, Ramos put her dreams of becoming a writer aside and went to work for Morgan Stanley, then a private equity firm. But she despaired of the well-worn track to Harvard Business School and pivoted towards journalism, eventually landing a job with the Economist. “For a while I did think maybe that was it,” she says. “It was writing. Unfortunately it was writing about finance and economics.” After a difficult third pregnancy, Ramos became a stay-at-home parent. Instead of the office, Ramos spent her days at the park with her children or taking them on play dates. As she got to know the people looking after the other children she realised that many of them were nannies, and many of them were Filipinas. As a child in Wisconsin, she spent every Sunday surrounded by her Filipino relatives, but as a mother in New York, “the only Filipinas I knew were domestic workers”.Ramos started writing short stories about the inequalities she saw around her, the gaps between the friends she made at Princeton and the friends she was making by the swings and slides. She dismisses these stories now with a wave of her hand as “bad, bad, bad”, but one day at breakfast she picked up her husband’s copy of the Wall Street Journal and saw an advert for a surrogacy service in India. “I’d never heard of them before,” she remembers, “and I didn’t do any more research. I didn’t even think it was a story idea, it’s just that I couldn’t stop thinking about it.” The idea of a place where women go to carry other people’s babies is extreme, Ramos continues, “but it’s only an extension of what’s already happening. Women take care of other people’s kids all the time, leaving their own kids behind, sacrificing family for family.”Gradually a novel started taking shape with chapters that switched between Jane, Evelyn, Reagan and Mae. “I didn’t know how else to do it,” Ramos explains, “because otherwise it was one person’s perspective and one view. I wanted to question the society we’ve collectively chosen, so I wanted to have people who believe in it, too.”At the heart of surrogacy lie questions about choice and power, but Ramos says she has nothing against it. “I guess I would question how far we’ve pushed so many things into the realm of markets. I just wonder what that does to our relationships.” When value is conflated with price, as happens so often in our society, things get warped, she says: “Certain things which are unpaid, like motherhood, are not even seen until they’re outsourced. Does surrogacy make people value pregnancy more … or does it diminish it because it’s just another thing to buy?”Ramos may not have the answers for our disoriented world, but since Trump’s election she has become more active in politics, teaming up with friends to support a local state legislator. “There are so many things that seem dire right now, so I just try to pick a battle or two where maybe me and my friends can make some difference.” She’s not yet sure how she’ll respond to events in Alabama, but staying on the sidelines is not an option. “I think people will remember this time, either way it goes. And what they should be asking of us is: ‘What did you do?’ And I would like to be able to hold up my head and say that at least I tried.”• The Farm by Joanne Ramos is published by Bloomsbury.

Why has the city turned its back on water?Of the near-endless flow of people over the busy Shibuya scramble crossing every day, few realise that beneath their feet is something else flowing, unseen and unnoticed: the crossing of two ancient rivers, the Uda and the Onden.Beneath all the concrete and neon, Tokyo is a city built on water. It is the reason the Japanese capital’s 37 million citizens are here at all. From fishing village to seat of political power, canny water management was a key driver of the city’s extraordinary growth.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownYou’d never know it today. As cities from Seoul to Chicago to Sheffield revitalise their waterfront areas with huge economic and environmental benefits, Tokyo has turned its back on water. Its rivers have been allowed to stagnate. Streams have been filled in, highways built directly over rivers. Waterways used to be a key method of transport and cultural life. Now the rivers and canals are dirty, desolate and nearly deserted.Fly over Tokyo and you will almost certainly spot at least one of the four megarivers that converge on the city: the Arakawa, Sumidagawa, Edogawa and Tamagawa. These broad, shimmering belts are just the main ones: more than 100 natural rivers and manmade canals flow underneath a city now more famous for glass, steel and concrete.In fact, it was water management that made Edo, as Tokyo was known, larger than London by 1700. Warehouses lined Tokyo Bay, goods travelled up the rivers and canals just as they now do on roads, while theatres, teahouses and, inevitably, the red light district took advantage of the bustling waterways. The era’s famous ukiyo-e or “floating world” woodblock prints reflect the centrality of water to the life of the city. European visitors compared it with their own continent’s great water city: “In all things Edo presents peaceful harmony,” wrote Aime Humbert, a Swiss envoy, of the city between 1863 and 1864. “Where does one find its like in Europe? Only along the banks and in the squares of the Queen of the Adriatic, Venice herself.”Today, comparisons with Venice are thin on the ground, but you can still find evidence of water running vein-like under the city’s concrete skin, if you know where and how to look. Flat roads lined with lush greenery, for example, often indicate a buried stream. Temples and graveyards suggest a suribachi: a natural hollow in one of the city’s hills, where a spring and pond used to be.“As Tokyo has modernised, the role of water has disappeared,” says Prof Hideonbu Jinnai of the University of Tokyo. “But the past memory and images still exist in today’s Tokyo and are an important factor in understanding the identity of Tokyo.”The Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 was the first rupture with the city’s water-based development. The extensive rebuilding saw planners embrace more western styles of building. Further reconstruction after the second world war – when Tokyo was burned to the ground – and then the run-up to the 1964 Olympic Games decisively turned the face of the city away from water, and not for the better, says Jinnai.A recent boat trip along the Sumida river with Akira Abe of the Machifune Mirai Juku waterway activists revealed miles of faceless industrial development and grey residential towers. Strict regulations on building within the river’s flood zone were relaxed in 2004, and again in 2011, but few developers have seized the opportunity.As you travel up quieter canals and tributaries, there is a sense of gloom and neglect – but also of possibility. Abe points out the overhanging cherry trees: sakura season is beautiful on the Edo-era canals, he says.Over two and a half hours on the boat, very little water traffic passes the exceptions are a futuristic-looking tourist waterbus, designed by manga artist Leiji Matsumoto, and a yellow six-seater water taxi. “You need to book six months ahead to get a trip on one of those,” jokes Abe.The lack of boats is partly because of fire restrictions at docks, many of which are designated for emergency use only. Docks are also managed separately by national, metropolitan and ward authorities, with little coordination, making it complicated for businesses to make use of them.But it is also a legacy of the 1964 Games, which saw a rapid revision of the city’s transport infrastructure at the cost of the waterways. Multi-lane highways were built directly above rivers and canals, to avoid the cost of purchasing and clearing land. The Nihonbashi river and its beautiful Meiji-era bridge were particularly noticeable victims, but the effect on the ecology and the economy of the waterways was even more devastating.Already polluted by years of sewage and industrial runoff, the planting of concrete support columns into rivers caused further stagnation and pollution of the water, as well as making the waterways unusable to many commercial craft.With the eyes of the world trained on Tokyo, streams were considered so irredeemably polluted that they were filled in with construction rubble, then concreted over. Others were culverted to conceal the stench and sludgy flow, becoming roads instead (and arguably simply replacing one form of pollution with another).The one bright spot water-wise was the development of a modern sewage system. Tokyo toilets are the envy of the world, and stopped one form of pollution at least from entering the water network.In more recent years, there have been attempts to reconnect Tokyo with its waterfront, most notably the Odaiba land reclamation project. During the 1980s economic boom, the city consolidated a scattering of defensive batteries (created towards the end of the Edo period) across Tokyo Bay into two manmade islands, which were earmarked for huge development projects. Then the economic bubble burst, leaving the area vacant until the 1990s, when hotels and companies moved in. Odaiba is now a hi-tech entertainment destination, criticised by some as soulless but a popular visitor attraction.As Tokyo prepares for the 2020 Olympics, some are pushing for the city to re-evaluate the role of water. Odaiba’s marine park is set to host the Olympic triathlon and marathon swimming events, which has meant confronting the poor water quality in Tokyo Bay, a legacy of centuries of polluted waterways.There are also plans to demolish the Nihonbashi flyover, and rather ambitiously turn it into a road tunnel under the river instead. The plan was originally mooted in 2005, and in 2017 the land minister, Keiichi Ishii, confirmed it would move ahead after the Olympics. Last week, the government released its environmental assessment of the impact of a tunnel, and an engineering consultancy formally began work on a proposed tunnel design.The city is also planning to increase its water transport fleet, making water taxis and bus routes a more viable transport option. The environmental benefits would be substantial, too. “Canals are an excellent base for transport and for managing the heat island effect,” notes Norihisa Minagawa, architect and co-founder of the urban history walking group Suribachi Gakkai.However, the biggest obstacle to Tokyo once more embracing its canals and waterways is not money: it is the indifference of Tokyoites. Re-engaging the city’s residents with their waterways after decades of neglect is no easy task. “It’s very difficult to move the public and the government,” says Minagawa. “It’s not much investment – if people want it it’s easy. It’s not a difficult, complicated project, because money is not an issue. It’s more to do with the system. People are not interested. That’s why education is important.”For inspiration, many Tokyo urbanists are looking abroad to other cities. “In Treviso, north Italy, many canals are spread all over the city. The city doesn’t even use them for tourism, they are simply part of the rich city-life,” Jinnai says. “Docklands in London and the revitalisation of the Thames, and the recent revival of Milan water canals, are a good reference for Tokyo.”“The ideal city is a revival of ‘Water Tokyo’,” says Minagawa. “Revive all those canals.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

In 2019, in a liberal democracy such as Japan, could the issue of women’s rights still be stuck on stilettos?But the global spotlight on the hashtag #KuToo (a pun on a word for shoes and a word for pain) may have obscured what’s really happening in Japan. “It’s so trivial,” says one senior female publishing executive, who wished to remain anonymous. After all, on the streets of Tokyo, there is a growing movement for real change for women, not merely more comfortable footwear.“We are so surprised that overseas media paid so much attention to the high-heel issue,” says a member of abuse survivor organisation Spring. “There is a much more serious and deeper issue: Japan’s sex-crime issue.”On Tuesday night, bearing placards reading “Say no to sex crimes” and “Judges need human rights education”, hundreds of women and men gathered near the Imperial Palace. The “flower demonstration” is a peaceful monthly protest against sexual violence, sparked by a string of recent acquittals in sexual assault cases.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownOne of the highest-profile women to attend was Mizuho Fukushima, a member of the House of Councillors and a former chair of the Social Democratic party. “More attention needs to be on the offenders, while victims shouldn’t be judged,” she said at the protest.It is a big progressive step for a country that remains mired in deep-seated conservatism when it comes to gender roles. Japan remains a shocking 110th in the world for gender equality, according to the World Economic Forum. At the recent abdication of Emperor Akihito, women were not even allowed into the ceremony room, let alone eligible for the Chrysanthemum throne. Last year nine medical schools admitted rigging entrance exams to exclude female applicants. In the world of sumo, an outcry erupted after female medics, who had rushed to the aid of a stroke victim, were ordered away from the ring, a male-only space.But if Japanese women have often been stereotypically portrayed as submissive and weak, this idea may be dissipating at the start of the new Reiwa era. The flower demonstration is the highest-profile example, and was set off by an unusually cruel court verdict. The case involved a father who was accused of repeatedly raping his 19-year-old daughter. The court accepted that he had nonconsensual sex with his daughter – but said it could not prove that she resisted, and acquitted him.Similar protests have been held in nine cities across the country, and more than 40,000 women have signed petitions demanding justice. Many sexual assault survivors have started to speak out about their experiences, including Jun Yamamoto, head of Spring.“We hope to create a society where victims will be warmly and emphatically told: ‘We believe you. It’s not your fault,’ and be strongly supported,” Yamamoto says. “To that end, a victim-centred approach must take root in Japan.”Yamamoto is a leading lobbyist for a change in the sexual assault law, which the government rewrote in 2017 for the first time in over a century. The new law included forced anal and oral sex in the definition of rape, raised the minimum sentence for rape to five years from three, and made prosecution possible even if victims do not press charges. But there is lots more to be done, she says, including greater support for victims.Another target is institutional discrimination. Last week, 36 women filed suit with the Tokyo district court against Tokyo Medical University, seeking a combined 143m yen in damages. The school is one of nine that admitted rigging entrance exams to systematically exclude female applicants, favouring less-qualified men. After it was exposed, some people defended the policy, using the rationale that because some women would leave the profession to have children, more male doctors would stave off a future labour shortage. The scandal prompted a government investigation, and plaintiffs hope the suits will discourage similar gender discrimination in future.Meanwhile, even something as apparently straightforward as being allowed to wear whatever shoes you like continues to prove tricky. In response to the #KuToo petition, Japan’s minister of labour, Takumi Nemoto, told parliament that requiring high heels in the workplace was perfectly acceptable – sparking further outrage at the government of Shinzo Abe, whose “Womenomics” policy is supposedly attempting to bring more women into the workforce.“‘Womenomics’ is BS,” says the publishing executive. “They need to work on raising the level of women first. But it’s so hard to speak out publicly. In private we complain to each other, but in public the atmosphere is so difficult: men control everything. It’s so deeply rooted. There are almost no women in power, so of course you think: is it only because of my ability that I don’t advance? Or is it something else?”Many such challenges remain at the highest levels of politics. The former Olympics minister Yoshitaka Sakurada recently urged all Japanese women to have “at least three children”, prompting women on social media to point out that blaming women wouldn’t solve Japan’s record-low birthrate.And despite Abe’s policies, only one in 10 politicians in the lower house of parliament, the House of Representatives, are female, and there is only one female member of the 20-member cabinet, an actual decline from the beginning of his tenure.Etsuko Kato, professor of cultural anthropology and gender studies at International Christian University in Tokyo, says a fundamental change in attitude is needed to create a female-friendly working environment.“We need to change the sense of values – a good work ethic doesn’t mean long hours or even going to an office, if you start to think a talented worker is someone who can manage more work in less time,” she says. “Also, if you’re good, you are able to choose when and where you work, so this kind of attitude could change the system more effectively. With the development of the internet, it is possible to change such an attitude in many industries.”There has been some movement in business. Traditionally male professions, such as sushi restaurants, have been a challenging field for women to break into. Some traditionalists say women’s hands are too warm to keep the fish fresh, while others say long hours are a barrier.Hiroshi Abe, of Abe Sushi, which has seven restaurants across the city, is a rare restaurant owner who doesn’t care about the gender of his staff, and has actively recruited female chefs.“There is a great chance both for women and men chefs, as the industry has been growing,” he says. “Female chefs are appreciated, as they take care of some details that male chefs don’t notice.”There is also the persistent argument that Japanese women remain influential in areas of the domestic economy. Traditionally, they dominate household spending and childcare, with husbands bringing home pay and wives managing savings and spending, including a monthly allowance for the man. Even today, seven out of 10 households operate in this way, according to the Ouccino Research Institute.That model looks increasingly old-fashioned, however. Kato says the gender gap has consistently narrowed for the past 30 years, a trend hastened by the discrediting of Japan’s male-dominated industrial model through years of economic malaise.“There are young women in their 20s and early 30s who want differently,” confirms the publisher.Nevertheless, Kato argues that more attention must be paid to men’s attitudes: no matter how loudly Japanese women speak out, nothing will change unless male attitudes do too.“To create a truly more equal society,” she says, “we need to wait for conservative Japanese men over 50 to retire.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

Yes, there’s something comforting about knowing that the next episode is only ever one short countdown away, but it’s also the case that being able to watch shows when we want and as frequently as we want (at least until that terrible moment when the episodes dry up) is increasingly affecting the way we consume TV – and not necessarily for the better.Take, for example, the conversation around spoilers. It’s no coincidence that this has only intensified in the era of binge TV, when people no longer have any clear idea of when they can start discussing a major twist. Worse, binge-watching encourages us to put our inidual viewing experience centre stage, positioning it as equal to, if not more important than, the programme being watched. This means that we’re enraged when someone quicker off the mark discusses a show before we’re ready, leading to bitter arguments that would have been avoided if everyone was watching at the same time.And it’s not just spoiler etiquette that’s affected. The worst thing about binge-watching isn’t the online fury or the fear of missing out or even the sneaky lying to your family about how many episodes you’ve really watched. It’s that it denies viewers the pleasure that a truly communal TV experience brings.That sense of television as a communal rather than an inidual experience is the reason why the year’s most talked about shows – Game of Thrones, Line of Duty and Fleabag – have been those that aired weekly, forcing audiences to wait. Being made to wait seven days for each new episode of Game of Thrones is the reason why even the smallest plot points were analysed and debated and why viewers became so creative with memes and gifs.Similarly, if Line of Duty had been binge-watched, no one would have had time to concoct elaborate theories about OCGs and UCOs, while watching Fleabag back-to-back would have entirely lessened the cultural impact of the Hot Priest, a man whose appeal (or lack thereof) was driven by the fact that fans were feverishly discussing it every week.Of course a version of those conversations might still have happened if those shows had been available to watch all at once but they wouldn’t have dominated popular discourse in quite the same way.Not convinced? Then consider the example of The Last Kingdom. When it aired weekly on BBC Two, the travails of Uhtred, son of Uhtred were readily available to chew over in bite-sized chunks. The excellent third series has been on Netflix since last November but any discussion was over almost before it had truly begun. Similarly, Deutschland 83 was one of Channel 4’s biggest hits when it aired weekly. Deutschland 86, the sequel, barely caused a ripple after being released in its entirety on Walter Presents via All 4 earlier this year.The very nature of binge-watching means that the conversation becomes fragmented and, while it’s wonderful to find your tribe, those people who are obsessing over Call My Agent or the select (but clearly correct) few who have tracked down the second series of Harlots, it’s hard to top the rush of knowing we’re all watching the same thing at (roughly) the same point in time.At this point, committed bingers are no doubt shaking their heads in despair at my old-fashioned and out-of-touch ways. I understand. Truly, I do. It’s nice to have the power and the freedom to watch something at your own speed, to finish something when and as you want. But it’s nice too to have the space to think about what you’ve watched, to mull over what just happened while waiting for the next episode to air and to feel part of a wider moment (even if your biggest contribution is to say “why on earth is everyone watching this crap?”).At its best, television has always been a two-way conversation between creators and viewers, stuffed full of tasty morsels to discuss. The trouble with binge-watching is that it turns that over-stuffed banquet into a superficially filling but ultimately unsatisfying meal for one.• Sarah Hughes writes on TV and the arts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604e2807ea24d8c718d646a42faa5117bce49c12/0_139_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=132eb5421ccb30fb4989c2e4d2b541ab","title":"fifth of pupils in england miss out on first choice of secondary","story":"Proportion of students getting into preferred school hits lowest level in decadeThe proportion of students in England getting into their first-choice secondary school has dropped to its lowest level for a decade as pupil numbers surge, official figures show.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called for additional school places to meet growing student numbers. “The fact that more families have missed out on their preferred choice of secondary schools this year is a sign of the pressure on the system as pupil numbers rise. This is likely to intensify over the next five years because the number of secondary school pupils is expected to increase by another 376,000.“Additional school places will need to be planned carefully to match demographic need. But this is only one part of the picture. We must ensure every family is able to access a place in a good, local school wherever they live, and that they don’t feel the need to chase places in over-subscribed schools.”The school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: “Wherever they live and whatever their background, children deserve the best in education. Since 2010 we have created more school places and seen school standards rise, meaning there is a greater opportunity for pupils across the country to go to a good or outstanding school.“This means that, despite rising pupil numbers and the highest number of applications at secondary level for 12 years, the vast majority of parents sending their children to school this September received one of their top three preferences of either primary or secondary school.”Outstanding primary and secondary schools are typically exempt from routine inspection, but can be inspected if Ofsted has concerns about their performance. Ofsted inspected 305 outstanding primary and secondary schools this academic year – more than double the number inspected during the previous academic year.Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said Thursday’s figures were not surprising, but they should still “set alarm bells ringing”.“The fact that outstanding schools are largely exempt from inspection leaves us with real gaps in our knowledge about the quality of education and safeguarding in these schools. Some of them have not been inspected for over a decade, and when our inspectors go back in, they sometimes find standards have significantly declined.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/590cec5b16d2d9a79b541f6e829d4a229288a6a2/0_122_5361_3217/master/5361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e01b4dcad0e4005aa1b46614f8b9a5f","title":"mild but windy winter was greenest ever for uk energy use","story":"Last winter was the greenest ever for the UK’s energy system after strong winds produced more renewable electricity and coal-fired power dwindled.The news came as SSE announced on Thursday that it will close its Fiddler’s Ferry coal-fired power station next year, which will leave the UK with five coal plants by 2020. SSE said the plant, which employs 158 people, was financially unsustainable.National Grid, which operates the UK’s national electricity network, said on Thursday the UK relied less on coal power plants this winter, partly because it was the fifth-warmest winter recorded in the last 59 years. The milder temperatures dampened energy demand, making it easier for National Grid to avoid using coal in favour of running gas power plants, which produce only half the carbon emissions.Meanwhile, stronger wind speeds helped drive carbon emissions down by spurring higher levels of low-carbon renewable electricity from wind farms.As a result, the carbon intensity of Britain’s electricity – or the amount of carbon produced for every kilowatt of electricity – fell to an average of 242.8 grams of carbon between October to March.Elsewhere in the world severe winters and hotter than normal summers have had the opposite effect driving up energy demand to run heating and cooling systems, and increasing global emissions.National Grid said its new record low is half the level seen five years ago and is likely to fall further in the years to come as coal plants shut down. The report has emerged only weeks after the UK’s energy system ran coal-free for more than a fortnight for the first time since the Industrial Revolution.Fintan Slye, the head of National Grid’s system operator arm, said: “More renewable power generation and less coal is a trend that is here to stay and this carbon intensity milestone shows the pace of change in the UK energy industry.“We believe that by 2025 we will be able to fully operate Great Britain’s electricity system with zero carbon.” Stephen Wheeler, the managing director of thermal energy at SSE, said the Fiddler’s Ferry site in Cheshire could not compete with gas and renewable energy and was losing £40m a year, as government policy focuses on supporting less carbon-intensive forms of energy. “Financially, the station is making significant losses and our projections show that this will continue to be the case as the UK looks to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025 at the latest. At nearly 50 years old, the station is unable to compete with more efficient and modern gas and renewable generation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c7596e2cda2b1f2b943c938b977b59028c5f86/0_500_3915_2348/master/3915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7748b0bfcd7fa927f40427d13449d9d6","title":"two hour dose nature weekly boosts health study finds","story":"Researchers say simply sitting and enjoying the peace has mental and physical benefitsA two-hour “dose” of nature a week significantly boosts health and wellbeing, research suggests, even if you simply sit and enjoy the peace.The physical and mental health benefits of time spent in parks, woods or the beach are well known, but the new research is the first major study into how long is needed to produce the effect. If confirmed by future research, two hours in nature could join five a day of fruit and veg and 150 minutes of exercise a week as official health advice.The finding is based on interviews with 20,000 people in England about their activity in the previous week. Of those who spent little or no time in nature, a quarter reported poor health and almost half said they were not satisfied with their life, a standard measure of wellbeing. In contrast, just one-seventh of those who spent at least two hours in nature said their health was poor, while a third were not satisfied with their life.“What really amazed us was this was true for just about every group we could think of,” said Dr Mathew White, at the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the study. The benefits of a two-hour dose were the same for both young and old, wealthy and poor, and urban and rural people, he said.It also applied to those with long-term illnesses and disabilities, White said. “So getting out in nature seemed to be good for just about everybody. It doesn’t have to be physical exercise – it could be just sitting on a bench.”The researchers were also surprised that it did not matter whether the two hours in nature were taken in one go or in a series of shorter visits, or whether people went to an urban park, woodlands or the beach.Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: “It’s fascinating to see this link between exposure to nature and better health and wellbeing. This research makes a strong case for people to get out and about in more natural environments.The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, used data from a Natural England survey, the world’s largest study collecting data on people’s weekly contact with the natural world. It did not include time people spent in their gardens, as this was not measured. But White said half of people saw their gardens as representing more of a chore than a pleasure in any case. The data showed that two hours was the threshold for positive impacts: spending much more than that in natural environments did not appear to have any additional benefits.“I am continually surprised by the size of the effect,” White said. The boost to health was the same as previous studies have shown come from taking recommended levels of exercise, or living in well-off neighbourhoods compared with poorer areas. The study did not attempt to find out why being in nature was so beneficial, but White suggested a sense of tranquility could be the key: “Most people are under multiple pressures at any given time. So you go away in a natural setting, it is quiet, it is relaxing and it gives you time to start to process things.“We are also increasingly finding that the richness in bioersity of a setting seems to be important. We have tracked 4,500 people’s visits from the same survey and what you find is they get more stress reduction if the location was an area of outstanding natural beauty, a site of special scientific interest or that kind of thing.”The researchers took a series of factors into account in reaching their conclusions, including the greenness of a person’s neighbourhood, levels of air pollution, and whether they were married, had children or had dogs.They could not completely take account of whether the health boost was down to taking more exercise. But the researchers wrote: “Research into shinrin-yoku – Japanese “forest bathing” – for instance, suggested that various psychophysiological benefits can be gained from merely sitting passively in natural versus urban settings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214e882ad0ef534f6d0d1df3d8f6bb3142977309/0_0_1722_1033/master/1722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306d645b1671763633588015320d5d4d","title":"readers cinema","story":"After one fanatic reportedly broke records by watching Avengers: Endgame over 100 times in six weeks we asked for your storiesI saw it seven times – all in its first run at cinemas. What can I say? I was a 15-year-old girl! I cried my heart out every time. I remember sitting in the first row on opening night because it was otherwise completely sold out. Then I watched it again with friends, and again and again I watched it alone. I went to see it so often the local cinema gave me a free ticket to watch the last showing: I just loved the experience. It was a movie so epic, and until then everyone thought they don’t make them like that any more.I haven’t seen it lately but when my daughters are old enough I will try to find a cinema showing. It won’t be the same for them, of course, but it has to be seen and it is truly a movie that belongs on the big screen. Stephi, AustriaMy friend and I made 17 trips to Leeds city centre to revel in the greatness. Why? The sheer fun of the film, the soundtrack, everything encapsulated who we were at that moment in time. We even managed to collect a fair bit of memorabilia.We went so often that on our last visit we only noticed the rest of the audience’s 3D glasses when the film began. It turned out after 16 viewings in the “main” screen we had been relegated, and had to highfoot it to get to number 17 in time. Stu, AustraliaI couldn’t wait for Grease to be released in September 1978. You’re the One That I Want had topped the charts all summer and every Thursday I’d sit waiting to see the video on Top of the Pops. The world of Rydell High in the 50s was a world away from a 70s Edinburgh council estate. Then a rumour started that Grease would be classified AA, meaning nobody under 14 could see it. I was gutted. Luckily that was wrong, it was an A, and I spent the next 32 Saturday afternoons at the ABC cinema, Lothian Road, watching first a 20-minute short film about skateboarding that had Chris Montez’s Let’s Dance as its theme, then came Danny and Sandy at the beach, Love Is a Many Splendored Thing playing in the background, before the cartoon credits rolled. Sam, EdinburghAfter the whole debacle between Netflix and established cinema chains across the world, I was happy to see that the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam was showing Alfonso Cuáron’s Roma. Not only that, but the screening was in their state-of-the-art Cinema 1, with 4K resolution and beautiful, crisp surround sound. This elevates the already profound experience of Roma to a whole new level: you can feel yourself in the busy streets of Mexico City.I went several times, and took different friends each time. We pretty much all agreed that Roma was meant to be seen on a big screen, with great sound, rather than a tiny computer screen and tinny speakers. This is the kind of film that asks for complete immersion into a time, setting and aesthetic – it is a shame that it couldn’t be experienced that way by the majority of the public. J Medina, AmsterdamI went to see this film six times in the two weeks it played at our local Unit 4. That first time, it took my breath away – I’d never seen anything as captivating. Everything, from the premise to the music, the actors and the action itself (the fight scenes especially) was a revelation to this small-town 20-year-old. Thrilling.I also fell in love with one of the extras, which must’ve been part of the draw (the young woman with the long blonde hair in the Lizzies scene). A week later, myself and a group of friends went to see it again in Rawtenstall: we were passing joints around when suddenly the lights came on and police streamed in and frogmarched us out, into waiting vans. Busted! Martin Peacock, AccringtonWhile I saw the 1982 theatrical cut on TV and really liked it, I fell in love with the director’s cut and saw it four times in two weeks when it was released in cinemas in 1992. This doesn’t sound like much, but if you consider the three different versions of Blade Runner to be “one film”, then I’ve seen it over 20 times at the cinema. They could release a fourth version tomorrow with the only difference being a one-second cut to an incidental scene and I’d be the first to buy a ticket.You really can’t beat seeing those stunning visuals on the big screen and hearing Vangelis’s gorgeous soundtrack in the theatre. I’m lucky that the Astor in Melbourne screens it about once a year, although there’s not one currently scheduled for 2019 (strange given that’s the year the movie is set). Neill Brown, MelbourneI see new details and nuances each time. Recently, for example, I noticed the wire rakes in the garden shop Marion’s boyfriend works in, and their resemblance to skeletal claws. But why was such an image planted there, rather than in the Bates Motel? This kicked off a line of enquiry I will take into my next viewing. I also find seeing the film each time with a new audience helps me to experience it in its totality quite differently. Recent viewings have opened my eyes to its sly humour. Emotionally, I identify with those in the audience seeing the film for the first time and share with them the frisson of its unravelling. Alex, LondonMy 16-year-old daughter and I completely fell in love with this film (we were seeing a lot of Bollywood films at the time), and returned at least six times over the course of a couple of weeks, taking with us various reluctant friends each time. We loved the adventurous characters (played by Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji) and their slow-burn romance, the high-spirited (but never mean-spirited) capers they ran, and their pursuit by a wily cop played by legendary superstar Amitabh Bachchan (Abhishek’s father). We adored the music, lusted after the clothes, and never got tired of it, even after we knew the Hindi dialogue by heart. Laura Boyes, North CarolinaI stumbled on Annie Proulx’s short story and it captivated me. I was in my mid 40s when the movie was released and I went to see it solo at a matinee here in San Francisco. I was so moved I was shaking when I left the cinema and, afraid I was going to burst into tears, had to hide behind a pillar to smoke a cigarette. My hand was trembling as I tried to light it.I went back seven times, sometimes alone and sometimes with friends. I became fixated on certain scenes and would watch them over and over again on YouTube – the story really got under my skin and I spent a year on IMDb discussing it with other fans. Trevor Martin, San FranciscoI turned 20 in the summer of 1989 and went crazy for Tim Burton’s first Batman film. Maybe because it was the first “proper” superhero film since Superman II … maybe it was because it had a great soundtrack by Prince and a moody score by Danny Elfman (I bought both albums on various formats) and maybe because I loved the sartorial choices on display (double-breasted suits and 40s fedoras), but I couldn’t get enough of it.At the time I had a girlfriend in Venice, and when I went in October to visit her the movie had just been released there. Naturally, we went to see the film on a date (her first viewing, my eighth). When we came out she said she loved the moment when Bruce Wayne got shot through his jacket and didn’t notice. My jaw dropped. I’d seen the film so many times and hadn’t noticed that detail. I saw it again recently and I felt no wave of nostalgia, just a sense of huge disappointment. “Is that it?” I thought.

Nobody would ever call that endeavour “dinner” – the activity revolved around food, but could never be reduced to it. In Bosnian, the verb that describes such an activity is sjediti, which means to sit, as the whole operation consists of sitting around the table, eating, drinking and being together for the purposes of well-earned pleasure. If I want to invoke an image of my parents being unconditionally happy (not an easy task), I envision them with their friends at a table, roaring with laughter between bites of delicious fare and sips of slivovitz (damson or plum brandy) or grappa.This would sometimes last for a whole weekend: sometimes we would go to Boračko jezero, a modest mountain-lake resort, to join my parents’ friends and their families for 1 May, the socialist Labour Day. The inextricable part of the fun and joy there was the presence of others, and the spirit of abandon reigned from morn to midnight and beyond. But the central, inescapable bonding ritual was spit-roasting a lamb that would then be shared by all. There, as everywhere we lived, food was meant to be shared, which is why it is never permissible to eat while someone else is watching and not eating. Food is other people. We hate eating alone, just as we hate being alone.There are no records or memories of my parents ever going out on a dinner date, before or after they got married. There really was no restaurant culture in the Sarajevo of our previous life, even before the war. The restaurants were either expensive or not good, most commonly both. Not even in Canada, where they moved in 1993 as refugees, did my parents acquire a habit of going out for a meal. While Hamilton is not quite a culinary mecca, the primary reason for this reluctance is that visiting a restaurant means my parents would have to leave their zone of hard-won nutritional comfort to encounter a world of food unlikely to meet their strict requirements.Spending money on a meal in an unknown gastronomic territory, and all that in English, while Mama’s cooking is axiomatically the best in the world and their several fridges are full of reliable food, including the already proven leftovers, would just be foolish and irresponsible. In my family, eating is not meant to be an exploration, nor an expansion of cultural experience. Part of the food pleasure is in meeting the set expectations, while its indelible utility is in providing energy for labour, and therefore for survival. Food is an existential necessity, an irreplaceable element in the structure of daily life, and it should never be fucked around with in some expensive place that also happens to be devoid of friends and family.The only Hamilton place where the two of them might venture for a meal is the Mandarin, a Chinese restaurant featuring mounds of fried things and stewed stuff, plus very un-Chinese multilayered cake with industrial-strength frosting. The attraction to the Mandarin is largely a consequence of its all-you-can-eat wonder buffet, wherein the utopian concept of cheap and endless abundance, dreamed of by generations of Slavic peasantry, is finally fulfilled.When my parents were growing up, there was little food, never mind bottomless buffets. As adults, they reached a level of comfort when they had enough and then there was even more, so they took out a loan to buy a freezer in order to stock up. Their poor-people food ethos, where nothing should ever be wasted, aligned perfectly with the fact that unchecked consumption was prohibitive in socialism, everyone getting according to their needs and all that.An aspect of ethical food management was thus always striving to avoid waste, which might be a problem when one is confronting a Chinese buffet, where all that is left uneaten might end up as garbage. I have seen my father at the Mandarin pile on so much food, then soak it with an ungodly combination of sauces on offer, that I would fear he might have a heart attack he would eat all of it, then go for seconds and thirds. Moreover, a need to exploit the buffet and its low price to the max is a crucial part of enjoying it. There is also the pertinent fact that it is not certain, nor can it ever be, that a moment as abundant and enjoyable as this one – what with inexhaustible supplies of fried rice and spring rolls and dumplings and chicken wings – could be counted on to happen again. Eating more, beyond being full, means extending this safe and pleasurable moment, for the next one is never guaranteed you eat now, for who knows what is around the bend? The food intake is proportional to the uncertainty of the future. This is, by the way, how I gained 40lbs after I arrived on a cultural exchange trip in the spring of 1992 and decided to stay as the threat of war was looming over my home.Food can never be enjoyed unto itself it is never just a sensory experience, let alone a matter of sophisticated taste. Its meaning is always dependent on the outcomes of potentially catastrophic situations, its value always assigned in the context of particular lives and histories. Taste as such has no purchase, for it is impossible to orce the experience of eating from the constant practice of survival. Even if one eats to enjoy life, one has to stay alive first, which requires far more than merely entertaining the senses. The restaurant critics who pretend that their expert epicurean taste entitles them to evaluate food are nothing but fools who think that something as basic as eating could be objectively appraised.Once or twice I took my parents to a white-tablecloth restaurant within my financial reach, insisting that they must enjoy the experience. Instead, they were confused by the long, convoluted descriptions of the dishes, suspicious of the server’s solicitude and pessimistic about the nutritional value of the pretty arrangement. “We’ll be hungry in an hour,” Mama would pronounce, inescapably projecting into the unstable future. In a stable, leisure-oriented world, being hungry in an hour would mean that you would simply eat in an hour. But as far as my parents are concerned, no one knows what might happen in an hour. At the very least, they might be working on something that would not allow them to stop, since hunger would only impede them from getting it done.The bizarre thing about the very concept of the restaurant, so obvious as to be invisible, is that it is a place where strangers serve strange food to strangers, knowing absolutely nothing about what they like, about what they think, about who they are, about what their life history is. Restaurant food is impersonal, uncommunal, consumed in the isolation of public space. In my parents’ culinary universe, pleasure and perfection are achieved by generations of fine-tuning, adjusting it all to the personal preferences. Mama cooks what has been cooked by all the other women in Bosnia Tata asks her to make his favorite dishes in the way he likes them, and she does so. What restaurant can provide that kind of service? This creates mutual psychological collaboration between them, an addictive and symbiotic food-centered operation wherein Tata gathers (shopping) and produces (smoked meat, honey) the supplies for Mama to transform them into food.In my family, food is part of a complex system of knowledge that has its own hierarchy of value, wherein meat and bread are at the top. Meat is appreciated in all its variations: cuts, smoked meat, sausage, spit-roasted. It has inherent value because, in the peasant past, it never came from a butcher or a supermarket, but from living creatures whose numbers measured wealth, who might have had names and spent winters in the house with the family.The value of meat was also proportional to the work it took to put it on the table. This is why vegetables have always been considered inferior. Although tending the garden takes some work, vegetables just grow, and when you want to eat them you just cut them or add them to the meat – vegetables contained no drama, they could not be given names, nor could they ever become a measure of wealth and property. Vegetables are thus tolerated for being inherently a side dish, not quite real food. Although vegetarians might be respected (if ever encountered), they are hard to understand. The choice not to eat meat implies levels of comfort and privilege few of us have ever managed to reach. My family cannot quite fathom it. Why eat only broccoli when you can eat any meat you want?Bread, on the other hand, is practically sacred. In Bosnian, there is an idiom applicable to a saintly good person: “As good as bread.” Although it does take land and hard work to produce wheat and grind it into flour that will become dough to be kneaded and baked into bread, its symbolic value has less to do with all the effort than with the fact that it is the poor people’s most basic staple – if you have bread, you have food, and if you have food, you live. Bread, in another words, equals life. My father’s favourite expression for work is “earning a crust of bread” while my mother (and everyone I know) harbours a deep respect for bread. She used to admonish us for not leaving it on its flat side but upside down, as that is somehow disrespectful. Nor is bread ever thrown away. My grandmother and aunts made a dish from old bread called popara: they steamed the stale bread and added lard to cover up the strong undertones of mould. I make French toast for my kids after I pick the mouldy bits off an old loaf.In my parents’ ethical universe, a portion of which could always be found in their fridge, leftovers play an important role. To throw food away is a sin against the generations of poverty. This is also why a special value is ascribed to the last and smallest edible particles: to the meat around the joint bone, to the heel of bread or to the burnt potato sticking to the bottom of the roasting pan. I was brought up to believe that these were particularly tasty, only to undergo an epiphany a few years ago, realising in a single painful moment that it was all poor people’s bullshit, nothing but peasant propaganda, ensuring that even the tiniest, unpleasant morsels are eaten and nothing is ever thrown away.Hence my parents’ fridge is always full: apart from what is needed daily (dairy, meat, wilted vegetables), there is the stuff that awaits its final consumption: half a sausage that may be weeks old eggs scrambled once upon a time but presently nurturing their own little colonies of living organisms the week-old soup in a little pot covered with a saucer which my mother will retrieve a moment before it goes bad to reheat it for my father. My parents can’t throw away food, just as I can’t kill a living thing – something deep inside us, some cellular moral law, prohibits such an act. Not so long ago, I undertook a heroic effort to clean my parents’ main fridge. Two swollen garbage bags later, the fridge still appeared full, as though possessed by some magic wherein the more you take out, the fuller it gets.This food hoarding – if that’s what it is – is not necessarily related to my parents’ personal memories of hunger. Mama does not remember ever being hungry or worrying about food. Tata was only hungry after leaving his parents’ home to go to the boarding school, where there never was enough food for an adolescent boy, but that lasted only until he got his first stipend. In another words, they never, not even during the wars they lived through, experienced systemic deprivation that would constitute an existential threat. Their food anxieties are rooted in a shared history in which subsistence could never be guaranteed, where living was always survival and where food abundance was ever temporary, at least by virtue of being seasonal, entirely dependent on hard work and weather and luck.And even if my parents rose out of poverty to become socialist middle-class, they learned that the structure of comfort they had spent their lives building offered no protection from history, which would, in the early 90s, come crashing down on their heads. Whatever food anxieties may have lessened with middle-class stability were doubly reactivated with the war, which totally validated the survivalist food ethics they had been so familiar with.The value of leftovers is also rooted in a particular domestic economy and the gendered ision of labour. Since time immemorial until, at best, my parents’ generation, women were the ones expected to manage food, in addition to rearing children and all the other domestic duties. Grandma Mihaljina spent her life between the kitchen and attending to the livestock and various small children, first hers, then her children’s. Grandpa Ivan would work in the field, and then come to the house for a meal – bread, borscht, pierogi, steranka – that she would prepare from scratch. She would save everything that was not eaten – and this also before they had a fridge – to serve it again until it was all gone. Leftovers equalled time and labour that she could put into other chores or, rarely, rest.Grandma’s food was a conduit that transmitted love. Peasant women worked too hard and too much to find time to cuddle and play with the kids instead, they would make their favourite dishes. This is another source for the ethical value of food – it carried love. Back in the day, upon Tata’s return from some long trip of his, Mama would make a zucchini pie (tikvenjača), thus expressing whatever happiness she might have felt for having him home. These days, when she comes to visit me, she insists on making something she believes I like and crave. Sadly, my diet and tastebuds have changed, so there is less and less of her comfort food that I long for. She gets hurt when I reject something she prepared for me, and I have to concede and allow her to actualise her love in the form of apples stuffed with walnuts and poached in honey. So for days after her departure, as I devour tufahije, my caloric intake triples.When my grandmother died, my father was working in Africa. He received the news while staying at the Kinshasa Intercontinental, and could not get back in time for her funeral. Alone and devastated, he spent nights pacing in his impersonal hotel room, obsessively recollecting something that happened in Bosnia some 20 or so years before: he dropped by his parents’ because he was nearby for work he surprised his mother and she was so happy to see him that she decided to make his favourite pie. At incredible speed, she peeled and shredded the apples and made the dough and stretched it thin and rolled it up with the apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture inside, put it in the oven to bake for 40 minutes or so. But he was young and impatient and could not wait and, even though she begged him to stay for the pie, he left before it was done. Twenty years later, in the Kinshasa hotel room, he beat his chest and ripped his hair out for not staying, longing hopelessly for that untasted apple pie, for that moment that could never be retrieved nor relived.For my sister Kristina and me, “apple pie” has become a code term for a situation where our negligence toward our parents is likely to result in some devastating future regret. “I won’t be coming to see them for Christmas,” I would say. She would only say, “apple pie”, and I would be coming to see them for Christmas.A few years ago, my father went to see a doctor, who diagnosed him with high blood pressure and instructed him to cut red meat out of his diet. A week or so later, I called to see how things were going. Tata picked up the phone. What are you doing?” I asked. “I’m eating bacon,” he said with no compunction whatsoever. I immediately started yelling: “Didn’t the doctor tell you not to eat red meat, and now you’re eating bacon?”“It’s not red, the bacon,” he said. “It’s all white.”For my parents, one of the symptoms of my having become “American” is my new fussiness in relation to food – I seem to pay too much finicky attention to my diet. When I go to visit them, I berate them for eating bacon, force them to eat fish (“We’ll be hungry in an hour”), and steam vegetables instead of roasting them. For some dubious future health benefit, I deny them – as I do myself – the food they have always eaten and enjoyed. To my mind, I practise as much dietary recklessness as the next Bosnian, but what my parents see is not so much a radical change in nutritional content as a shift in attitude.To my parents, seeking health by way of self-deprivation makes no sense whatsoever. Food has always equalled survival, which is to say that the more and the better food was available, the greater the chances of survival were. Throughout my childhood, my mother would insist that “health enters through the mouth”.Moreover, food is joy. It is joy because it contains pleasures earned by work it is joy because it can be shared with other people it is joy because it is life and life is a really good and healthy thing, incomparably better than any spiritual endeavour contingent upon morally rewarding self-mortification. The systemic extermination of joy in the US is not only unethical but also plain stupid. There is no reasonable argument that could be made against the pleasures of bacon, let alone the bacon my father cut and smoked himself. Only after I berated my parents a few times (and I might do it again) for their over-enjoyment of food did I realise that, compared to them, I did become American and thus, to some extent, puritan.The value and meaning of food is always necessarily altered, just like everything else, by displacement. For one thing, “our” food is either unavailable or scarce in the new place, at least it was at the beginning. Therefore, it becomes a mark of loss, which makes it essential for all nostalgic discourse. For years after their arrival, my mother would deliver analytical soliloquies on, say, the ineffable yet substantial differences between “our” sour cream and the Canadian (“their”) kind. The authenticity of “our” food exactly matches the authenticity of our life in the past. Conversely, the inauthenticity of our life in displacement can be tasted in “their” food. In Mama’s discourse, our sour cream is a stable category, possessing unchanging qualities correlating to the unchanging, authentic principles that guided our previous life – the principles that were violated and, indeed, destroyed by the war and subsequent displacement.Our food, in other words, stands for the authentic life we used to live, which is no longer available except as a model for this new, elsewhere life. It is therefore important that the food-related practices from the previous life be reconstructed in the new context. The food, if made properly, might be where authenticity is partially restored, despite the displacement. While that authenticity was available in the previous life, it requires tremendous effort to rebuild it in the new one, where the torturous possibility that nothing could ever be the way it used to be is continuously present, like a big nose on a face.This idea is best expressed in a story I heard in Sarajevo from someone who had heard it from someone else, who, in turn, knew the person who knew the person to whom all this happened. In short, the story is true as can be, even if I fact-checked none of it, because it accumulated relevant experiences and value while passing through other people.So: a Bosnian refugee – let’s call him Zaim – ends up in some small town in the US. Life is tough, there are few friends, the family is far away and the longing for Bosnia is painful. Zaim develops a craving for spit-roasted lamb, the most universally revered food in Bosnia. He wants to do it the way it is supposed to be done – stick a whole lamb on a spit and then slowly revolve it for hours over fire and embers, sipping beer and talking to people, until it is finished. Though piecemeal lamb is available, a whole one is not. Zaim finds himself in some town rife with malls and megamarkets. There is everything there, except, of course, a whole lamb. In his profound craving for spit-roasted lamb, Zaim purchases all the pieces needed to assemble a whole lamb: the head, the neck, the breast, the shoulders, the chops, the ribs, the legs. When he collects all the necessary parts, he staples them together. So there it is: a monstrous lamb, which man and history rent asunder, but is now put back together by a determined Bosnian, who, beer in hand, proudly and slowly revolves it over the fire. Despite the heroic effort, it still doesn’t taste the same.After more than 20 years in displacement, my parents have assembled a life, nutritional and otherwise, that aimed to be a restorative replica of the previous one, but is in fact a Frankensteinian assemblage of elements old and new. They eat everything they would have been eating if they had stayed in Bosnia, even if it can be hard work to get all the stuff. They depend on their ingenuity as well as on several stores catering to people from the former Yugoslavia. But the meaning of it all has changed in displacement. Whereas what they ate in Bosnia was typical, an important part of the totality of shared experience, in Canada it makes them appear of a different, exotic world. Their nutritional philosophy is not what connects them to their surroundings, but what sets them apart. They make their food to taste of home, but it inescapably ends up having the taste of displacement.This is an edited extract from My Parents: An IntroductionThis Does Not Belong to You by Aleksandar Hemon, published by MCD• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc29ab342c906c41e52b1753602419250e7de53/0_0_5619_3371/master/5619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9266b54aa4b7741f2210504448c0983b","title":"jay rayner dad ahead of his time except cooking","story":"Despite his dreadful wurst omelette, my father taught me a great deal – not least how to be a good dadRecently, my eldest messaged me a photograph from the kitchen of his student house. It was of a bowl of ramen. There were the curling noodles, like cross-stitch, bobbing in a broth the colour of copper coins. There were the sliced spring onions and halved boiled egg, the yolk still running, the outside of the white fully bronzed from its long rest in a soy-based marinade. There was no commentary no “Look what I made” or “Fancy some?”. There didn’t need to be.It was a father-son thing. The two of us have eaten so much ramen together over the years, argued over the finer details of what makes a good one and laughed uproariously at the bad, that he knew I’d get it. He’d made his own ramen and he wanted me to see it. Obviously, I celebrated my glorious parenting skills. I had passed on the baton of fatherly enthusiasm. I’d given him both a love of the good stuff and a desire to make it for himself. Go me.But while I looked forward, I also looked back. I would never have shown my late father pictures of my cooking. Or, if I had, Des would have greeted it with a puzzled, knotted brow, as he scrambled for the right thing to say. When he died, almost exactly five years ago, I wrote about how Des had time for a good salt beef sandwich or well-made fish and chips, but otherwise shared none of my greedy interests. I concluded this was probably a good thing. It gave me a little perspective.What I didn’t mention then, shadowed by intense grief, was his complete failure as a cook. It drove me completely nuts, but back then I really didn’t want to be critical. It seemed at odds with a man who had been so ahead of his time. My mother had been the lead earner in our house and he had supported her, rather than the other way around. He had been fully involved in every detail of our upbringing.And yet, at the stove he was a disaster. If my mother was working and dinner duties ever fell to Des, I knew he’d be cracking out the wurst, a salty, blunt kosher beef salami, rendered a disturbing pink courtesy of God knows what, which despite our lack of religious observance, was always in the fridge. This, he would slice into thick rounds and fry. It would be served with a rubbery omelette made crimson from the leaking processed meat. It was terrible a meal wasted. I couldn’t help but feel my father was negligent in not having equipped himself with the necessary culinary skills.But as my own son has reached the age where he could start pinging food pics at me, I realise how unfair this was. Des was the product of a particularly feckless man – my grandfather – who wasn’t exactly on point when it came to the fathering business. Certainly, he was disdainful of men cooking or, indeed, basic expressions of love. To simply get into adulthood more or less in one piece was an achievement for my dad. Expecting souffle recipes or an intimate knowledge of roasting times as well would be unreasonable.My child, meanwhile, has had a privileged upbringing boasting lots of space in which to share the joy over the perfect bowl of ramen. Frankly, it would be surprising if my boy wasn’t pinging me images of steaming noodle bowls, just as my own dad’s lack of skills was also unsurprising. It would be convenient if I now announced that, this Father’s Day, to remember him, I’ll be knocking up a plate of wurst and eggs. I won’t. It really is an awful dish. But as a dad myself, I think I finally understand Des a little bit more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dce947efdbac98d77447e27863a76b5af9ea108b/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e733c1af6ec4da38dbc354d570675864","title":"pale rose isnt better and nine other pink wine myths debunked","story":"It’s all sweet, it’s only for summer or ought to be cheap ... the prejudices about rosé wine endure, but we really should know betterRed wine gives you headaches white wine tastes of nothing, unless it’s sauvignon blanc all Aussie wines are fruit bombs the world will end if the flow of prosecco falters – the world of wine is full of ridiculous prejudices. Yet no style gets discriminated against quite like rosé. It’s all sweet, we’re told, or it’s only for women, or for summer, or for women in summer …For a long time, rosé was disregarded because good winemakers didn’t make it: star California winemaker Rajat Parr, who was a San Francisco sommelier in the 1990s, once said: “No one cared about it, no one thought about it, no one drank it.” That, thank goodness, has changed – yet the prejudices remain. So let’s bust a few persistent myths.The ancients were probably drinking pink when Julius Caesar was knee-high to a grasshopper. In ancient Greece and Rome, white and red grapes would often have been crushed together, by foot, and the contact of the juice with red grapeskins would have meant that most wine was some version of red. Since the rules of classical civilisation held that all wine must be diluted with water – only barbarians drank it straight – a lot of that juice would have wound up a shade of pink.In ancient times, essentially yes, since, as noted, all the grapes were mixed together. These days we do things a little differently. There are two ways to make rosé now: the saignée method and skin contact. The former involves bleeding off some juice after red grapes have been pressed: that juice becomes a lightly tinted wine, while what is left becomes a more concentrated red. Skin contact, or maceration, involves leaving the juice and its skins and pulp all mulched together for a time (hours, usually) so that some of the flavour and colour from the solid matter seeps into the wine.Rosé certainly can be cheap, but anyone who has ever drunk vintage pink champagne knows that isn’t always the case. In Provence, Sasha Lichine set out to create a really premium rosé and succeeded: he sells millions of bottles of his Whispering Angel, at about £18 each. That’s his budget option: the gorgeous Les Clans won’t leave you much change from £50. Far from being the also-ran option for those without the know-how or the talent to make white or red, rosé is “the most difficult colour I’ve ever had to make good,” says Lichine. Also costing about £18 is Domaine Tempier rosé, from the prestigious Bandol appellation, which is credited with first showing the world how great rosé can be. I have seen Domaine Tempier’s co-founder Lulu Peyraud knock back a glass as if it were water, and she’s 101 and counting. If Bandol rosé holds the secret to eternal life, then £18 seems pretty reasonable.Absolutely not. This myth probably arose because the wines of Provence, which range in colour from apricot to salmon, are so admired. And rightly so: when good, they are herbaceous and saline and dangerously drinkable. But colour isn’t an indicator of quality – in fact, as pale rosé has become more popular, some winemakers have prioritised shade to such an extent they have ended up with a kind of alcoholic water.Ugh, no. You’re probably thinking of Mateus rosé. Or zinfandel blush. The former is a bubblegum-pink Portuguese wine that was hugely popular in the 1970s and 80s – around the same time as the Austrians were getting into trouble for sweetening their wine with antifreeze. Anything would taste good after that. Zinfandel blush is an American wine originally made by the Sutter Home winery in California but best known here for the bright pink Blossom Hill version. The best rosé, such as Chivite’s Las Fincas Rosado, is dry and aromatic and elegant it goes beautifully with food. It is also rather nice without food.Rosé certainly goes well with sunshine – and the Provençal kind makes a marvellous combination with tomato salads, artichokes or other summer delicacies. But I drink rosé all year round, and it brings a little summer glint to grey winter days.There are wondrous rosé aperitifs they are so wondrous you can keep drinking them throughout the meal. The only wine aperitifs that don’t work with food are those, such as muscadet, that are too delicate to compete with any strong flavours. This is not how good rosé does business.Anyone who ides the contents of their bar along gender lines deserves to be consigned to drink water for ever. Good rosé is for people who like good wine. If you are of legal drinking age and in possession of a couple of tastebuds, it is for you.Oooh, no. These days, rosé is made almost everywhere, from South Africa to Australia, and most countries can thrust forward some good examples, although France makes more – and more of the best – than anywhere else. But French rosé spreads far beyond Provence. There are rosés d’Anjou in the Loire, and wonderful pink pinots (such as those made by Sylvain Pataille as Fleur de Pinot) in Burgundy. One of my all-time favourite rosé regions (and it is an appellation, highly unusually, that only applies to rosé) is Tavel, a delicious, raspberry-coloured (and raspberry-flavoured) wine from the eponymous village in the southern Rhône – just across the river from Châteauneuf du Pape. (They don’t make rosé, although one of the most famous CDP producers, the Perrin family, produces the excellent and phenomenally successful Miraval, better known as Brangelina’s wine.) Good tavel is fabulous mediocre tavel is living off the wine’s centuries of glory, when Louis XIV graced it with his favour and Balzac, the world’s most caffeinated writer, would put down his beloved coffee cup for a glass of it. As recently as last century, the great gourmand AJ Liebling declared it the only rosé worth drinking.

The Spanish midfielder also insists that he has no intention of continuing at Barcelona, where he still has two years left on his contract, but does not want to play in the Premier League again and prefers to remain in La Liga. Valencia have shown the greatest interest in signing him.Suárez joined Arsenal at the end of January on loan from Barcelona but played just six times in a desperately disappointing spell for the club – twice in Europe and four times in the league. He told Cadena Ser radio he did not feel right from his second game at the club, against Bate Borisov.It was there, the Spaniard said, that his loan spell unravelled, completing a year “to forget” – one that had “started badly” with two injuries at Barcelona and a six-month spell in which he played just eight times, four of those in the Copa del Rey. “But I take some positives from it,” he said. “It’s something to learn from, to take better decisions in the future, prevent injuries, and to improve.”Suárez added: “I have two years left at Barcelona I renewed my contact before I left. What I want is to play. At Barcelona I think I’m not going to have the opportunity to participate regularly and what I want is to leave and to play. Where? I don’t know. Wherever is best for me. I have to look at everything. My idea is to stay in the Spanish League, to be near home and compete in La Liga.

It is a detail that is often highlighted and Spurs have fared rather less well in this area, with only two home matches after Champions League group ties. Liverpool finish the season against Arsenal (away), Chelsea (home) and Newcastle (away).Manchester City start the defence of their title at West Ham. They appear to have a relatively gentle start but will have the red pens out to circle the period from late February to early April, when they play Arsenal (home), Manchester United (away), Chelsea (away) and Liverpool (home) in five rounds of games.Manchester United host the highest-profile meeting of the opening weekend, against Chelsea on Sunday 11 August, and the first four of their fixtures against big-six rivals are at Old Trafford. For Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team the defining period will be from New Year’s Day to mid-March, when they have trips to Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Spurs – plus the Manchester derby at home – in 10 rounds of matches.Pep Guardiola\u0027s back-to-back Premier League champions renew their rivalry with Jürgen Klopp\u0027s European champions in their first meeting since landing their latest respective silverware. Liverpool pushed City all the way in an epic title race last season and have home advantage as they bid to draw first blood in pursuit of their first domestic crown in 30 years. Guardiola\u0027s side will be equally determined to maintain the edge after beating the Reds 2-1 in their previous encounter in January as they bid for a domestic league hat-trick.\u0026nbspLiverpool were crowned European champions for a sixth time after beating Tottenham in Madrid 12 days ago and the north London side will want revenge. The pair are sure to challenge for a top-four finish in the 2019-20 campaign and this Anfield clash will be an indicator of their title credentials. The Reds won both league matches 2-1 last season and have 10 wins and only one defeat in their last 15 meetings in all competitions.\u0026nbspChelsea secured a comprehensive 4-1 victory against Arsenal in this summer\u0027s other all-English European final to lift the Europa League trophy for a second time. If the Gunners can avenge their painful defeat in Baku in their first meeting since, it might go a little way to appeasing those fans who are growing ever louder in their criticism of the club\u0027s inability to compete with the top four. Champions League qualification is a minimum requirement for both clubs, who each won their respective home game in this fixture last season.\u0026nbspSheffield United boss Chris Wilder joined an exclusive group of managers to have won promotion to each of the top four isions in England when his side pipped Leeds to a second-placed finish in the Sky Bet Championship. Without a Yorkshire derby next season - the Blades\u0027 first in the top flight since 2006-07 - their fans will relish the visit of Manchester United, who were their opponents at Bramall Lane in both clubs\u0027 first Premier League fixture on the opening day of the 1992-93 season.\u0026nbspVilla Park is expected to be sold out for the club\u0027s first home game back in the top flight, although some fans may have preferred more illustrious opponents to mark the occasion. Dean Smith\u0027s side sat 13th in the Championship at the start of March, but stormed to promotion via their play-off final win against Derby after ending the regular season with 11 wins in their last 12 matches including 10 in a row. Villa spent three seasons in the second tier after finishing rock-bottom of the Premier League, with just 17 points, at the end of 2015-16, but lifelong fan Smith guided them back after just over seven months in charge. PAThe Championship winners, Norwich, face a baptism of fire. After the trip to Liverpool, they have home games against Chelsea and Manchester City in rounds three and five. Sheffield United, another promoted club, must play Manchester City at home and away, along with games at Liverpool and Arsenal, in five rounds from 28 December.Spurs entertain the play-off winners, Aston Villa, on the opening Saturday and their first four meetings with big-six rivals are away. Chelsea have a crunch sequence from 22 January when they host Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in four rounds, while Arsenal will look at a tough start features Liverpool (away), Spurs (home) and Manchester United (away) in seven rounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b20eeb190062b2d034369f6d63f8ddfd875967c/0_107_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e13c92f17581e8b540db8e319971add","title":"southampton sign moussa djenepo standard liege","story":"Ralph Hasenhüttl has made the Standard Liège winger Moussa Djenepo his first signing at Southampton for a fee of £14m.

The Croatian has signed a two-year contract and Albion hope that his appointment will excite their supporters and take the club on a path that leads them back to the Premier League.Albion have been without a permanent manager ever since Darren Moore was sacked in March, and identifying a replacement has been a far from straightforward process. Jimmy Shan, the first-team coach, took over in a caretaker capacity and remained in that post until the end of the season, which finished with Albion losing against Aston Villa in the Championship play-off semi-final.Almost a month has passed since that defeat and Albion have worked their way through a long list of contenders, including Danny Cowley, the Lincoln City manager, Chris Hughton and Bruno Labbadia, the former Wolfsburg manager. Bilic emerged as the standout candidate, however, after a second round of talks.“I’m delighted with this opportunity of course,” said Bilic, whose last job was with the Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad. “We want to improve on the pitch and Albion have convinced me they want to return to the Premier League. Albion have a short-term project and a long project and they do not clash. They made it clear they wanted me to be the one to lead them in this and I didn’t think twice once they had spoken to me.”While the wait has been a little frustrating for some Albion supporters, the news that Bilic has accepted the post is likely to placate them. The 50-year-old is a strong personality, vastly experienced and will be a high-profile name in the Championship.There will need to be a rebuilding job of sorts at the club, mindful of the need to reduce the wage bill after Albion failed to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking, but Bilic has clearly received assurances that the ambition is there to mount another promotion challenge next season. Albion are confident that they have found the right man to deliver on that front.“From the moment we spoke to Slaven, we were struck by his enthusiasm and excitement about this challenge,” Luke Dowling, Albion’s technical director, said. “He is determined to get back to the Premier League and believes passionately that he can do that with Albion. We believe he is a great ‘fit’ for us – his presence, experience and management qualities are just what we need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bd57071f05a391ec0cbcf2d9cdf9ac70338b200/0_306_4591_2755/master/4591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bdd0f06501decbfdd0fcee8d6f8fdfd","title":"thrashings tackles and welsh worries football weekly extra podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Lars Sivertsen, Michael Butler and Chris Paouros discuss a record-breaking World Cup win, follow-throughs, Wales in trouble, Lionel Messi making a lot of money and the perils of being a non-league referee"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

This brings a bigger question: what does it mean to be genetically Jewish? And can you prove religious identity scientifically?After arriving in Eastern Europe around a millennia ago, the company’s website explained, Jewish communities remained segregated, by force and by custom, mixing only occasionally with local populations. Isolation and intermarriage slowly narrowed the gene pool, which now gives modern Jews of European descent, like my family, a set of identifiable genetic variations that set them apart from other European populations at a microscopic level.This genetic explanation of my Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry came as no surprise. According to family lore, my forebears lived in small towns and villages in Eastern Europe for at least a few hundred years, where they kept their traditions and married within the community, up until the Holocaust, when they were either murdered or dispersed.But still, there was something disconcerting about our Jewishness being “confirmed” by a biological test. After all, the reason my grandparents had to leave the towns and villages of their ancestors was because of ethno-nationalism emboldened by a racialized conception of Jewishness as something that exists “in the blood”.The raw memory of this racism made any suggestion of Jewish ethnicity slightly taboo in my family. If I ever mentioned that someone “looked Jewish” my grandmother would respond, “Oh really? And what exactly does a Jew look like?” Yet evidently, this wariness of ethnic categorization didn’t stop my parents from sending swab samples from the inside of their cheeks off to a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company. The idea of having an ancient identity “confirmed” by modern science was too alluring.Not that they’re alone. As of the beginning of this year, more than 26 million people have taken at-home DNA tests. For most, like my parents, genetic identity is assimilated into an existing life story with relative ease, while for others, the test can unearth family secrets or capsize personal narratives around ethnic heritage.But as these genetic databases grow, genetic identity is re-shaping not only how we understand ourselves, but how we can be identified by others. In the past year, law enforcement has become increasingly adept at using genetic data to solve cold cases a recent study shows that even if you haven’t taken a test, chances are you can be identified by authorities via genealogical sleuthing.What is perhaps more concerning, though, is how authorities around the world are also beginning to use DNA to not only identify iniduals, but to categorize and discriminate against entire groups of people.In February of this year, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, reported that the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, the peak religious authority in the country, had been requesting DNA tests to confirm Jewishness before issuing some marriage licenses.In Israel, matrimonial law is religious, not civil. Jews can marry Jews, but intermarriage with Muslims or Christians is legally unacknowledged. This means that when a Jewish couple want to tie the knot, they are required by law to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate according to Orthodox tradition, which defines Jewish ancestry as being passed down through the mother.While for most Israeli Jews this simply involves handing over their mother’s birth or marriage certificate, for many recent immigrants to Israel, who often come from communities where being Jewish is defined differently or documentation is scarce, producing evidence that satisfies the Rabbinate’s standard of proof can be impossible.In the past, confirming Jewishness in the absence of documentation has involved contacting rabbis from the countries where people herald or tracking genealogical records back to prove religious continuity along the matrilineal line. But as was reported in Haaretz, and later confirmed by David Lau, the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, in the past year, the rabbis have been requesting that some people undergo a DNA test to verify their claim before being allowed to marry.For many Israelis, news that the rabbinical judges were turning to DNA testing was shocking, but for Seth Farber, an American-born Orthodox rabbi, it came as no surprise. Farber, who has been living in Israel since the 1990s, is the director of Itim, the Jewish Life Information Center, an organization that helps Israeli Jews navigate state-administered matters of Jewish life, like marriage and conversion. In the past year, the organization has seen up to 50 cases where families have been asked to undergo DNA tests to certify their Jewishness.Those being asked to take these tests, Farber told me, are mostly Russian speaking Israelis, members of an almost 1 million strong immigrant community who began moving to Israel from countries of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Due to the fact that Jewish life was forcefully suppressed during the Soviet era, many members of this community lack the necessary documentation to prove Jewishness through matrilineal descent. This means that although most self-identify as Jewish, hundreds of thousands are not considered so by the Rabbinate, and routinely have their Jewish status challenged when seeking religious services, including marriage.For almost two decades, Farber and his colleagues have advocated for this immigrant community in the face of what they see as targeted discrimination. In cases of marriage, Farber acts as a type of rabbinical lawyer, pulling together documentation and making a case for his clients in front of a board of rabbinical judges. He fears that DNA testing will place even more power in the hands of the Rabbinate and further marginalize the Russian speaking community. “It’s as if the rabbis have become technocrats,” he told me. “They are using genetics to give validity to their discriminatory practices.”Despite public outrage and protests in central Tel Aviv, the Rabbinate have not indicated any intention of ending DNA testing, and reports continue to circulate in the Israeli media of how the test is being used. One woman allegedly had to ask her mother and aunt for genetic material to prove that she was not adopted. Another man was asked to have his grandmother, sick with dementia, take a test.Boris Shindler, a political activist and active member of the Russian speaking community, told me that he believes that the full extent of the practice remains unknown, because many of those who have been tested are unwilling to share their stories publicly out of a sense of shame. “I was approached by someone who was married in a Jewish ceremony maybe 15, 20 years ago, who recently received an official demand saying if you want to continue to be Jewish, we’d like you to do a DNA test,” Shindler said. “They said if she doesn’t do it then she has to sign papers saying she is not Jewish. But she is too humiliated to go to the press with this.”What offends Shindler most is that the technique is being used to single out his community, which he sees as part of a broader stigmatization of Russian speaking immigrants in Israeli society as unassimilated outsiders and second-class citizens. “It is sad because in the Soviet Union we were persecuted for being Jewish and now in Israel we’re being discriminated against for not being Jewish enough,” he said.But according to Yosef Carmel, an Orthodox rabbi and co-head of Eretz Hemdah, a Jerusalem-based institute that trains rabbinical judges for the Rabbinate, this is a misunderstanding of how the DNA testing is being used. He explained that the Rabbinate are not using a generalized Jewish ancestry test, but one that screens for a specific variant on the mitochondrial DNA – DNA that is passed down through the mother – that can be found almost exclusively in Ashkenazi Jews.For David Goldstein, professor of medical research in genetics at Columbia University whose 2008 book, Jacob’s Legacy: A Genetic View of Jewish History, outlines a decade’s worth of research into Jewish population genetics, translating scientific insights about small genetic variants in the DNA to normative judgments about religious or ethnic identity is not only problematic, but misunderstands what the science actually signals.“When we say that there is a signal of Jewish ancestry, it’s a highly specific statistical analysis done over a population,” he said. “To think that you can use these type of analyses to make any substantive claims about politics or religion or questions of identity, I think that it’s frankly ridiculous.”But others would disagree. As DNA sequencing becomes more sophisticated, the ability to identify genetic differences between human populations has improved. Geneticists can now locate variations in the DNA so acutely as to differentiate populations living on opposite sides of a mountain range.In recent years, a number of high-profile commentators have appropriated these scientific insights to push the idea that genetics can determine who we are socially, none more controversially than the former New York Times science writer, Nicholas Wade. In his 2014 book, A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History, Wade argues that genetic differences in human populations manifest in predictable social differences between those groups. His book was strongly denounced by almost all prominent researchers in the field as a shoddy incarnation of race science, but the idea that our DNA can determine who we are in some social sense has also crept into more mainstream perspectives.In an op-ed published in the New York Times last year, the Harvard geneticist David Reich argued that although genetics does not substantiate any racist stereotypes, differences in genetic ancestry do correlate to many of today’s racial constructs. “I have deep sympathy for the concern that genetic discoveries could be misused to justify racism,” he wrote. “But as a geneticist I also know that it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among ‘races’.”Reich’s op-ed was shared widely and drew condemnation from other geneticists and social science researchers.In an open letter to Buzzfeed, a group of 67 experts also criticized Reich’s careless communication of his ideas. The signatories worried that imprecise language within such a fraught field of research would make the insights of population genetics more susceptible to being “misunderstood and misinterpreted”, lending scientific validity to racist ideology and ethno-nationalist politics.And indeed, this already appears to be happening. In the United States, white nationalists have channeled the ideals of racial purity into an obsession with the reliability of direct-to-consumer DNA testing. In Greece, the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party regularly draw on studies on the origins of Greek DNA to “prove” 4,000 years of racial continuity and ethnic supremacy.Most concerning is how the conflation of genetics and racial identity is being mobilized politically. In Australia, the far-right One Nation party recently suggested that First Nations people be given DNA tests to “prove” how Indigenous they are before receiving government benefits. In February, the New York Times reported that authorities in China are using DNA testing to determine whether someone is of Uighur ancestry, as part of a broader campaign of surveillance and oppression against the Muslim minority.While DNA testing in Israel is still limited to proving Jewishness in relation to religious life, it comes at a time when the intersection of ethnic, political, and religious identity are becoming increasingly blurry. Just last year, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government passed the Nation State law, which codified that the right to national self-determination in the country is “unique to the Jewish people”.Shlomo Sand, an Israeli historian who has written extensively on the politics of Jewish population genetics, worries that if DNA testing is normalized by the Rabbinate, it could be used to confirm citizenship in the future. “Israeli society is becoming more of a closed, ethno-centric society,” he said. “I am worried that people will start to use this genetic testing to build this political national identity.”For Sand, there is a particularly dark irony that this type of genetic discrimination is being weaponized by Jews against other Jews. “I am the descendant of Holocaust survivors, people who suffered because of biological and essentialist attitudes to human groups,” he told me. “When I hear stories of people using DNA to prove that you are a Jew, or French, or Greek, or Finnish, I feel like the Nazis lost the war, but they won the victory of an ideology of essentialist identity through the blood.”But for Seth Farber, the problem with a DNA test for Jewishness runs deeper than politics it contravenes what he believes to be the essence of Jewish identity. There is a specific principle in Jewish law, he told me, that instructs rabbis not to undermine someone’s self-declared religious identity if that person has been accepted by a Jewish community. The central principle is that when it comes to Jewish identity, the most important determinants are social – trust, kinship, commitment – not biological. “Our tradition has always been that if someone lives among us and partakes in communal and religious life, then they are one of us,” Farber said. “Just because we have 23andMe doesn’t mean that we should abandon this. That would be an unwarranted and radical re-interpretation of Jewish law.”As I was reporting this story, it often struck me as oxymoronic that an institution like the Rabbinate would embrace new technology to uphold an ancient identity. It seemed to contradict the very premise of Orthodoxy, which, by definition, is supposed to rigidly maintain tradition in the face of all that is new and unknown.But Jessica Mozersky, assistant professor of medicine at Washington University in St Louis, explained that part of the reason why the Rabbinate might be comfortable with using DNA to confirm Jewishness is because of an existing familiarity with genetic testing in the community to screen for rare genetic conditions. “Because Ashkenazi communities have a history of marrying in, they have this high risk for certain heritable diseases and have established genetic screening programs,” she explained. “So this has made it less fraught and problematic to talk about Jewish genetics in Ashkenazi communities.”In fact, the Orthodox Jewish community is so comfortable with the idea of genetic identity that they have even put together their own international genetic database called Dor Yeshorim, which acts as both a dating service and public health initiative. When two members of the community are being set-up for marriage, Mozersky explained, the matchmaker will check whether or not they are genetically compatible on the DNA database. “This means that the notion of genetics as a part of identity is deeply interwoven in many ways with communal life,” she said.This is something I could identify with. When I was 16 and attending a Jewish day-school in Melbourne, Australia, we had what was called “mouth-swab day”. Everyone in my grade gathered on the basketball courts to provide spit samples that were sent off and screened for Tay-Sachs disease, a rare inherited disorder significantly more common among Ashkenazi Jews that eats away at the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. As we waited in line, we joked that this was our punishment for our ancestors marrying their cousins.A few weeks later, after we got the results, I told my grandmother about “mouth-swab day”. I was interested in her thoughts on my newly discovered genetic identity, which seemed to connect me biologically to the world she grew up in, a world of insularity, religiosity, tradition, and trauma.“It’s like I’ve always said,” she declared, after I told her that I wasn’t a carrier of this rare genetic mutation. “It’s important to mix the blood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86813740bf7332d8c355f1063039a1187a6a77c3/0_990_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fffacfae382a3e0730a7f118d6d8962","title":"express yourself breast pump revolution ease maternal stress","story":"As hi-tech pumps enter the market, it’s hoped the hassle and difficulty of feeding a small baby will soon be consigned to the pastMost women who have ever had to express breast milk will recognise the facial expressions of the comedian Amy Schumer in the pictures she has put up on her Instagram account in the past few weeks. There she is, hooked up to her double breast pump, looking tired and a bit bored, and at the same time grateful to be sitting down. As you may expect from Schumer’s work, it’s relatable – more so than the proliferation of more glamorous breast pump selfies from celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen, Pink and Kate Upton.At least they are all making milk expressing more mainstream, a momentum that has been building for a while. The actor Rachel McAdams was photographed for a magazine last year accessorising her double breast pump with diamonds and a Versace jacket. The TV series The Good Fight recently showed one of the lawyers expressing in her office and, last September, the model Valeria Garcia walked the catwalk at London fashion week “wearing” a breast pump. Amid the random, but pricey, selection of wares that made up the goodie bags for the nominees at the Oscars earlier this year was a breast pump – perhaps the surest sign yet that expressing milk is coming out of the closet and becoming more visible.In February, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn retweeted a news story about breastfeeding working mothers being forced to express in the toilets, adding “so much more needs to be done to make our workplaces welcoming for new mums”. Which isn’t an unusual or controversial opinion, but the accompanying large photograph of a woman using a double breast pump was an uncommon and arresting sight.Last year, an image went viral of the athlete Sophie Power feeding her three-month-old son on one breast while pumping milk from the other at a rest stop during the 105-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc race. This year, another ultrarunner, Jasmin Paris, stopped along the 268-mile Montane Spine race – which she won, with hours to spare – to express milk for her 14-month-old daughter.I have not expressed breast milk while performing such heroics, although I did once do it in the stinky toilets on a moving Southeastern train. Returning to work five months after the birth of my second baby – and having chosen, and been able, to breastfeed – I am having to reacquaint myself with my breast pump. First time around, I had to express to increase my nonexistent milk supply, and my stubborn wish to breastfeed meant I was trapped in a bovine and mostly miserable cycle of feeding, then pumping with the double-attachment hospital-grade machine I had hired, then feeding again.Once back at work, a less alarming electric pump allowed me to keep breastfeeding (I had soon ditched the manual pump I had tried). My relationship with my Medela pump varies between gratitude and grudge. It has allowed me to continue breastfeeding – and allow other people to take on feeding duties and prevent infections such as mastitis – but the constant sterilising, assembling, transporting, labelling, freezing and defrosting is a hassle.I am lucky in that I work mainly from home, but I have expressed while commuting, in department stores and pub toilets, while driving (not advised) and, once, sobbing in the ladies’ toilets while on a press junket – with painful, solid boobs and a pump that had run out of batteries – hand expressing into the toilet bowl. And yes, I realise how filthy that sounds. Who knows what the other journalists thought I had been doing when I crept into a group interview, late and stained. That was only four years ago but, as a measure of how much more visible milk-expressing has become, this time around I would ask for a proper place and time to do it.The Elvie pump (from the makers of the Elvie kegel trainer) – the one included in the Oscars swag bag – was launched in September last year and the company has raised millions in investment. It already has a strong social media presence, where women share pictures of themselves pumping. The pump is designed to be worn inside your bra, with no wires or tubes and can be controlled by an app on your phone that tells you how you are doing. The maker claims you can pump “at home, at work or on the go”, and even suggests you can “lead the meeting”. Would you want to lead a meeting while a machine drains your breast? I suppose some women might (or might have to). But one of the benefits I have found about breastfeeding, and expressing, is that you get to sit down a lot.I tried the Elvie pump at home, enjoying the novelty of being able to move around and get on with important tasks such as foraging for snacks. It feels modern – I charged it through the USB port on my laptop – but is expensive at £249 for a single pump. It is not as discreet as Elvie claims. Although it is very quiet, when popped inside your bra it creates the appearance of a noticeably giant breast. I synced it to the free app, which means you can control the pump using your phone, and monitored the use in real time: 12 minutes on one side should have produced 30ml of milk. But it turned out to be wrong – it is only supposed to be an estimate, but when decanted into a measuring jug, there was nearly twice that amount (when you are expressing, you become obsessed with every drop because getting it out is such a bore). I regularly started using the pump on train journeys, and once in a restaurant, although I soon gave up on the app. But if you are the sort of Oscar nominee who enjoys being untethered and monitoring bodily functions, I can see its appeal.And if you are the sort of employer who doesn’t feel like giving your new-mother employees the time and space to express milk, I can also see its appeal. I doubt this was the maker’s intention, but it is easy to see how milk-expressing wearables might become an unwelcome solution to the problem of pumping while working.If milk-expressing – that reality for many working women who breastfeed – is becoming more visible, legislation is still to catch up. “The law as it stands is inadequate with respect to what employers are required to do to support breastfeeding mothers returning to work, including those who wish to express at work,” says Paula Chan, a specialist employment lawyer at Slater and Gordon. In the UK, there are no rights to paid breaks or even “a basic legal requirement to provide facilities to enable mothers to express milk”, which should include a private room and somewhere to store milk.“In terms of what employers are required to do, there is a duty to provide a place for breastfeeding mothers to rest, and to carry out a risk assessment of issues, such as working conditions, or risks to the health and safety of the mother or her baby,” says Chan. Employers are also legally required to consider flexible working requests, which a mother might make to accommodate breastfeeding.According to the 2010 Infant Feeding Survey, almost a third of working mothers had returned to work when their babies were between eight and 10 months old – when they are still very much reliant on milk. Just one in five working mothers – and nearly a quarter in Scotland – said that they were given facilities to feed or express at work.The UK, unlike many other European countries, she says, is unusual in not having a statutory right to breastfeeding or expressing breaks. “As a result, women who would like to express milk on their return to work are very much reliant on their employer’s good intentions.”When Caroline went back to work as a supply teacher after her first child was born, she would ask where she could express but, going into different schools every day meant people often forgot about her request. On her first day back, she expressed milk in the cupboard in her classroom, sitting on the floor. Now back at work after her second child turned eight months, Caroline is expressing again. This time, she is working in a school where the teachers are with the children all day, so it’s a case of finding a quiet 10 minutes to go and express when she can. Some days she doesn’t get the chance, which can be uncomfortable. “Apart from the toilets, there aren’t any rooms I can lock,” she says. Instead, she uses an empty room and puts a chair in front of the door to stop children walking in. Has she felt embarrassed about asking where she can express? “Yeah, it feels like an odd thing to do – I think particularly at a school with children around, where I’m sitting in a room with my boobs out.” For many women, expressing is not simply a case of strapping on a pump and getting on with it. Stress will affect the letdown (the reflex that prompts milk to flow) and the amount of milk you can get, says Helen Gray, from the breastfeeding organisation Lactation Consultants of Great Britain. “Feeling private and safe has an effect on your hormone levels. Having a comfortable room and a locked door can make a big difference to mothers who are feeling nervous about having to do this in the workplace.” Ideally, working mothers who are breastfeeding shouldn’t be feeling nervous in the first place. If taboos around breastfeeding have largely been shattered, expressing is still relatively hidden – celebrity selfies and photographs of ultrarunners may help to normalise it, one fluid ounce at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53a047aae3178104061e97fae284be9fd4f98ae5/1120_506_2636_1581/master/2636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7dc74638a348ee09e8af47a906fc725","title":"evening standard could face inquiry over saudi investment","story":"Culture secretary will decide this month whether regulators should look into deal The Evening Standard and the Independent could face a government investigation into whether they can accurately present news and guarantee freedom of expression after a mysterious Saudi investor bought substantial stakes.The announcement, made in the final weeks of Theresa May’s government, is potentially embarrassing for the Evening Standard editor, George Osborne.

There’s an extradition request from the US that is before the courts tomorrow but yesterday I signed the extradition order and certified it and that will be going in front of the courts tomorrow.”Javid’s decision opens the way to the court sending the WikiLeaks founder to the US. Assange faces an 18-count indictment, issued by the US Department of Justice, that includes charges under the Espionage Act. He is accused of soliciting and publishing classified information and conspiring to hack into a government computer.Javid said: “It is a decision ultimately for the courts, but there is a very important part of it for the home secretary and I want to see justice done at all times and we’ve got a legitimate extradition request, so I’ve signed it, but the final decision is now with the courts.”The 47-year-old Australian was too ill to appear last month at a hearing at Westminster magistrates court in relation to the US request. The hearing has been rescheduled for Friday, and depending on Assange’s condition, may take place at Belmarsh prison where he is being held. WikiLeaks releases about 470,000 classified military documents concerning American diplomacy and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It later releases a further tranche of more than 250,000 classified US diplomatic cables.A Swedish prosecutor issues a European arrest warrant for Assange over sexual assault allegations involving two Swedish women.

It comes after one of the site\u0027s main sources of leaked documents, Chelsea Manning, is given clemency.Swedish prosecutors say they have closed their seven-year sex assault investigation into Assange. British police say they would still arrest him if he leaves the embassy as he breached the terms of his bail in 2012.Britain refuses Ecuador\u0027s request to accord Assange diplomatic status, which would allow him to leave the embassy without being arrested.He loses a bid to have his British arrest warrant cancelled on health grounds.Ecuador cuts off Assange\u0027s internet access alleging he broke an agreement on interfering in other countries\u0027 affairs.US prosecutors inadvertently disclose the existence of a sealed indictment against Assange.Ecuador\u0027s President Lenin Moreno says Assange has \u0027repeatedly violated\u0027 the conditions of his asylum at the embassy.Police arrest Assange at the embassy\u0026nbspon behalf of the US after his asylum was withdrawn.

Assange denies the accusation.Assange is serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for skipping bail after he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London attempting to avoid extradition to Sweden.Swedish prosecutors dropped their rape investigation in 2017 but reopened it after Ecuador rescinded its offer of asylum to Assange in April this year and allowed British police to arrest him.Thomas Garner, an extradition lawyer at Gherson Solicitors, said Javid’s certification of the request was “an important though merely procedural step” to start the extradition process.“I would expect the court to set a preliminary timetable for the extradition process tomorrow,” he said. “It is likely to be many months before any hearing at the magistrates court and of course either side may then seek to appeal that decision in due course. Despite this, the Swedish authorities will be monitoring the process carefully as the further down the line the US proceedings get the harder it might become for the home secretary to give precedence to any competing request.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/850e5822610501f7f6ff5592fc537eeee6da304c/0_68_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3e0c7968dd41d1cd443fcc82f47391b","title":"two door cinema club false alarm review","story":"(Prolifica Inc)The Northern Irish trio have embraced electronic pop, but they fail to give their strong hooks any personalityDoes 2019 offer a more baffling musical phenomenon than the continued success of what you might call second-wave noughties indie? Not the bands that erupted into the public consciousness at the start of the decade, with their huge hit singles and era-defining albums and identifiable images eagerly co-opted by fans – Coldplay, the Killers, the Libertines et al – but the ones who came five years later, damned as “landfill indie”, so nondescript you imagined them convening for rehearsals and peering puzzled at their bandmates: “Sorry, do I know you?”These are, after all, widely held to be thin times indeed for the kind of mainstream alt-rock that was once the NME’s lifeblood: the one thing noticeable by its absence on the main stage at this year’s Glastonbury is a hot young guitar band, catapulted to fame on a firework trajectory by overheated media attention, including at least one front cover that excitedly claims “THIS BAND WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE”. Over on the Radio 1 playlist, the Amazons offer a solitary, exception-that-proves-the-rule hold-out, swamped by hip-hop, grime and pop. Given the climate, you might reasonably ask, whither the lower-ision strivers of yesteryear, their moment in the sun a decade hence?You could read this as revealing a lot about how what’s deemed fashionable doesn’t always reflect what’s actually popular. That said, a sense that fashion has moved on does infect the fourth album by Two Door Cinema Club, the anonymous Northern Irish trio whose sales peak ostensibly came with their 2010 debut Tourist History, but whose forthcoming tour nevertheless takes in – you guessed it – the O2 Arena. Tourist History dealt in then-hip angular post-punk with commercial ambitions, but their ensuing two albums amped up the electronics. On the Jacknife Lee-produced False Alarm they take over almost entirely, leaving their music somewhere in the general vicinity of the 1975 at their least arty and most radio-friendly.This isn’t, in itself, a bad idea, and not merely because it feels more modish than their initial musical approach. Some of the results feel either commonplace or, worse, flimsy and annoying – perhaps unwittingly, Satellite sounds like mid-80s Europop, and thus proves something of an endurance test if you don’t have a lasting love for the oeuvre of Modern Talking and FR David – but there are tunes here that suit the makeover. Dirty Air and Satisfaction Guaranteed have strong hooks. Nice to See You ropes in Zimbabwean band Mokoomba on backing vocals and rapper Open Mike Eagle, then spends six minutes crossing its fingers that someone will compare it to Talking Heads, or Fashion by David Bowie. No chance, but it is a decent song in its own right. Similarly, frontman Alex Trimble has described the brief Break as coming from “the McCartney school of songwriting”. That rather amounts to gilding the lily – the tinny staccato synths vaguely resemble Wonderful Christmastime and that’s about it – but it’s a sweet melodic fragment nonetheless.The lyrics are largely centred around the internet. Listeners are advised to don body armour and goggles, lest they get hit by shrapnel from the truth bombs that follow. We variously learn that social media isn’t necessarily a force for unmitigated good, that defining yourself by the number of “likes” you get is a bad idea, that the image people project online often fails to reflect reality and that some people are using it to sell us things: watch out, manufacturers of Huel, Mahabi slippers and the Noom diet system, Two Door Cinema Club have totally got your number. These are inarguable points, but it’s also inarguable that they’ve been made before, umpteen times, and in some cases by Two Door Cinema Club, whose 2016 album Gameshow also socked it to social media and consumerism.Their fusillade against the internet highlights the problem with False Alarm. It isn’t a bad album – the songs are largely alright, the production neat – but there’s nothing on it that you haven’t heard already. Moreover, Two Door Cinema Club don’t have enough personality to impose any kind of distinctive character on the material: nothing is given a unique spin or a different slant. You could say that was the trouble with noughties indie 2.0 from the start, but it didn’t stop it getting huge a decade ago, and – given the ongoing appetite for this kind of thing – you doubt if it’ll stop anyone buying False Alarm, or indeed, filling the O2 Arena.Paradise’s obscure 1981 boogie track Sizzlin’ Hot reworked by the masterful Dan Snaith into frantic-paced, full-on, four-to-the-floor disco."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc7e03b68490df6acc8422afad6249dd1969201/50_554_4280_2569/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785922addb24b9493cc05c267ea3c567","title":"private armies secret deals russia putin drive into africa","story":"A cache of leaked documents appear to show how a close Putin ally is leading a push to turn Africa into a strategic hub with echoes of Soviet-era zones of influence.

He launched his campaign this week offering to create “a party where everyone is invited”. Seven men remain in the race.McVey said: “I am pleased to have had a platform to make the case for blue-collar Conservatism, a clean break from the EU and the need to invest money into schools, policing and a proper pay rise for our public sector workers.”Some of those who are entitled to go through to the next round, including Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Sajid Javid, are likely to come under pressure to withdraw and throw their weight behind one of the frontrunners.But there was little sign of wavering after the results were announced. Raab, who secured 27 votes, said: “I’m proud and honoured to have the support of so many brilliant colleagues today. This campaign is just getting started and we’ve got a good base to build on.”Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow, who is supporting Javid, said the home secretary had come in a “strong fifth place”. “It’s all to play for,” he said after the vote. “The public figures were 17 to 19 votes, and Sajid got 23. The momentum’s building up. We’ve got Ruth Davidson on our side, so we’re really happy.”Amber Rudd, who is backing Jeremy Hunt, denied that it was disappointing to see him so far behind Johnson. “Not at all,” she told the BBC. “He came a good second, he got more than Matt and Saj combined, and that’s what we were after – a clear lead in second place. It’s only the first round, there’s a few more rounds to go. I’m delighted.”Conservative MPs, including Theresa May and the 10 leadership candidates, were given a two-hour window to cast their votes in a House of Commons committee room.The prime minister declined to say who she had voted for. Leadsom, McVey and another underdog, Rory Stewart, stationed themselves in the corridor in the hope of winning over waverers.The contenders who failed to reach the threshold of 17 MPs were automatically eliminated, under newly introduced rules aimed at preventing a drawn-out contest. Stewart just made the cut with 19 supporters. Afterwards he insisted: “We can win this. Realism, action, unity, trust.”Brexit has dominated the campaign, with Johnson promising to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, “deal or no deal”. He has won over many of the party’s leavers, including the Eurosceptic stalwarts Steve Baker, Iain Duncan Smith and Mark Francois.Outside the vote on Thursday, another Brexiter, John Redwood, said he was also supporting Johnson. “He’s rightly said that the surrender document, or withdrawal treaty, is dead and that if necessary we will leave without an agreement on the 31 October,” he said.Another ballot will now be held next Tuesday, with further rounds to follow on Wednesday and possibly Thursday, until the field is narrowed to two. Their names will then be presented to Conservative members in a postal ballot, with the winner due to be announced in the week of 21 July.The new prime minister will have just three months to prepare for Brexit by the Halloween deadline set by EU27 leaders.Johnson’s progress into the final round now appears unstoppable unless he makes a significant misstep, and the fiercest battle is between Hunt, Michael Gove and Javid for the second place on the ballot.Hunt was narrowly ahead with 43 votes in the first round, against Gove’s 37 and Javid’s 23, and the candidates’ focus will now turn to winning the second preferences of their eliminated rivals.Rudd, who is supporting Hunt, said once the race was down to a final two it would “start again” in hustings to members, in which “anything can happen”.May will remain in 10 Downing Street until her successor is chosen, at which point her three-year tenure as prime minister will come to an end.The contest was triggered after her final compromise offer on Brexit – including the promise of a House of Commons vote on a second referendum – infuriated Tory colleagues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218f77da97ce31653b55f40a885358d25009db20/0_33_1595_957/master/1595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e41952addee1ccc2b032c7df39b81359","title":"parliament is out of options to stop no deal brexit tory mp oliver letwin","story":"Senior Tory says new PM can now let UK crash out of EU if no legislation put before MPsA senior Tory MP behind cross-party efforts to block a no-deal Brexit has said parliament has now run out of options for preventing the UK from crashing out of the EU after the defeat of Labour’s motion.Oliver Letwin, a former cabinet minister, was among the signatories to a Labour-led attempt to tie the next prime minister’s hands by ruling out no deal. It was defeated by 11 votes after eight Labour MPs voted with the government and 13 abstained, cancelling out 10 Conservative rebels who voted with Labour.The defeat means parliament has now exhausted the options for preventing a no-deal exit, according to Letwin. “We have run out of all the possibilities that any of us can at the moment think of,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The interviewer Nick Robinson pointed out that MPs could not block a no-deal exit happening by default if no legislation was put before parliament.In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place. The European Court of Justice would cease to have jurisdiction over the UK, and the country would also leave various other institutions including Euratom and Europol. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment. There would be no transition period. Free movement of people into the UK from the EU27 would stop.Trade between the UK and the EU would be governed by basic WTO rules. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘No Deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke Article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Letwin said: “That’s an extremely good summary of the situation, alas.” He added: “If the government doesn’t bring something before parliament, parliament won’t have a chance to take a view on that.”He played down the prospect of Tory MPs voting down their own government to prevent no deal. Letwin said: “Evidently that’s not something any of us want to do.”He added: “I’m not confident as things stand that the current Labour leadership would know how to solve this crisis either.”Letwin said he was not sure if Boris Johnson, the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, was a “no-deal Brexiteer”. He conceded Johnson was “clearly quite likely” to become the next prime minister.The former Conservative MP Nick Boles, who flew back to the UK to vote with Labour on Wednesday, also conceded that opponents of a no-deal departure were fast running out of options, apart from a confidence vote to bring down the government.He said: “No-deal Brexit on 31 October is back to being a racing certainty. It is very hard to see where any further legislative opportunities will come from. So it’s now a question of politics – specifically whether a PM pursuing a no-deal Brexit can command and sustain the confidence of the House of Commons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

He is probably the best debater in the House of Commons, and seems to be looking forward to the Channel 4 hustings on Sunday.And this is from Dominic Raab, who came fourth today.These are from Mark Harper, who was eliminated from the contest today.Here is the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, on the results of the first round of voting.This is what Rory Stewart, the international development secretary who is standing to become Conservative leader, said about bringing down Boris Johnson if he tried to prorogue parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit.Asked what he would do, Stewart told Sky News:Number one, let’s get Boris to be straight. Does he or does he not consider locking the doors of parliament to be acceptable? That is an unconstitutional, improper, really disturbing suggestion that you try to get something through by locking the doors of parliament. Answer us. I’ve been asking for a week, ‘Boris, are you going to lock the doors of parliament?’ If so, tell people, because we want to know what kind of leader or prime minister we are voting for. But he won’t be able to. I guarantee you, if he were to try, I and every other member of parliament will sit across the road in Methodist Central Hall and we will hold our own session of parliament and we will bring him down, because you do not, ever, lock the doors on parliament in this country, or in any other country with any respect in the world.Dominic Raab is the Brexiter leadership candidate who has publicly floated the idea of proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit (because sending MPs away from the House of Commons would stop them legislating to prevent a no-deal departure). Raab is not actively advocating this, but he says it would be a mistake to rule it out.Johnson has said he is not attracted to the idea of using prorogation in this way, but today’s Times reports that, in private talks with Tory Brexiters, he has not ruled out the idea. Here’s an extract from the Times story (paywall).The former foreign secretary was said, however, to have privately assured the hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of backbenchers that he would not explicitly rule it out.Some Brexiteers have urged the next prime minister to end the parliamentary session – known as proroguing – so MPs are unable to stop a no-deal exit from the EU on October 31, which would require the Queen’s permission.“He’s told the ERG he won’t take prorogation off the table and that he’s signed up to their plan for a ‘managed no-deal’,” a source on another campaign said.A senior Brexiteer confirmed last night that Mr Johnson had discussed the option of suspending parliament at a private meeting late last week. Another said: “I didn’t hear him rule it out.”The idea of getting a shadow parliament to sit in Methodist Central Hall is not as novel an idea as it sounds. In 2002, the then Labour MP Graham Allen investigated the idea of hiring Church House at Westminster for an informal recall of parliament to discuss the threat of war with Iraq. In the event, Tony Blair did recall parliament, and Allen’s plan was dropped.Here is my colleague Rafael Behr on Boris Johnson.And here is an extract.One of the two Johnsons served as mayor of London from 2008-2016. He has liberal, metropolitan instincts – broadly pro-immigration, old-fashioned in his use of idiom, but a moderniser at heart. Then there is 2016-2019 Johnson, figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, the ultimate Brexit-booster. He is a more aggressive, isive figure – a partisan of nationalistic culture wars who has consorted with Steve Bannon. Both Johnsons are dispensing wild promises to Tory MPs behind closed doors. The self-styled “one-nation” Conservatives and rightwing ultras each seem to think the other side is being taken for a ride, which suggests they all are.Matt Hancock surpassed expectations, a spokesman for his campaign said. The spokesman went on:MPs have responded well to Matt’s energetic and positive campaign. His pro-business message, his focus on taking the fight to Corbyn and the Lib Dems, not just the Brexit party, and his argument that the Tory party “need a leader for the future, not just for now”, has gone down well with colleagues.Here is a graph with the results.Here is Jeremy Hunt commenting on the result.“Serious leader” is, of course, code for “not Boris Johnson”.Here is a Labour response to the Rory Stewart interview.Rory Stewart has just given an extraordinary interview, PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield and BuzzFeed’s Alex Wickham report. I will post the quotes in a moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72cb54ae3c8ca502ab0020455109569968145ca9/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=631fd3d97e3241a6e4c9117a909d98bd","title":"india v new zealand cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"I’m getting some more emails coming in, but can I really keep going after the brilliance below? I feel like this is the natural place to let this lovely rain-soaked day come to rest. Inspection: the dream within the dream. And I’ve got to give points for competing to Brendan Large, who also gets points for having a name like a British sketch comedy character.Now this is a bold new foray into Erasmus Land. One of the lesser-known Faraway Tree destinations. Neeraj just casually knocking it out in five minutes. Star.Oooooh. Sharad has really upped the game with this alternate poster use.Oh yes. This is exactly what was called for. Aditya is first cab off the rank.To go back to Jack’s question from earlier, this abandonment isn’t really worth anything to the Kiwis at all. It gets them one point, which can be handy for teams that need a tie-breaker to qualify for a semi-final. But New Zealand already have a vastly better net run rate than anyone in the tournament, so if they do end up level on points then it’s a win for the Land of the Long White Cloud.As for India, they miss out on a chance to go three from three, and slot in right behind En Zed at the head of the table. For now the Indians have five points, sitting third behind Australian and ahead of England. It’s a handy point for them, but they would have backed themselves to beat New Zealand, and they would have enjoyed the workout against another strong team after knocking off the Aussies in London last weekend.As for the rest of us, we’ve been deprived of a truly tasty match-up between New Zealand’s excellent pace attack and India’s powerful batting. Ferguson, Henry, Boult slinging the ball down at Rohit, Kohli, Dhoni... a damn shame. Not to mention Ross Taylor’s red-hot form against Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvi Kumar. The pitch would have been zippy for fast bowlers, and the cloud cover might have introduced another element. But no good. We may not see these two teams play at all in this World Cup, unless they meet again in the finals. A crying shame.Enough rain now, everyone. Let’s just agree this has come far enough.David Malcom emails in some classic journo war stories.“I go way back to the days of uncovered wickets. All the old guys used to talk about how it produced exciting cricket. But it also meant hanging around for hours waiting for the pitch to dry out. I remember covering as a young reporter Northants v the New Zealand tourists in the early 1970s when it was a lovely sunny day from early morning and there was no play until 3pm because of fussy umpires. Gave me time for a good interview with Richard Hadlee but really pissed off spectators. “The grounds have improved greatly since then with modern drainage but the past week has again shown there is no way of guarding against terrible weather. A long tournament like this was always going to be at risk of descending into a soggy anticlimax. I have memories of freezing in press boxes at early season county matches and watching the downpours. The UK just does not have the weather for a game which is so sensitive to rain. Pity it never took on in Spain.”Well, in Spanish-speaking countries at least, I can tell you that Cricket Mexico is doing some very good work.Here’s one of the people making it happen, Craig White. The inevitable announcement comes through, and the match has been abandoned. New Zealand and India will share points. Jack Jorgensen is an Australian living in southwest England, and writes in with some sensible meteorology. “The average rainfall figures are misleading. You want to consider average days of rain \u0026gt 1mm. This is more useful as Australian rain in March is likely more intense, leading to less time actually raining. By my reckoning Sydney has 9.9 such days in March on average, and London 7.4. So whilst London has half as much average rainfall in volume, it’s likely spread out across more days, and hence the chance of rain affecting the play is not all that different. PS: thoughts on how happy this washout might make the Kiwis?”Quite so. But if the chance of rain is not all that different, it still derails the rather silly argument that we shouldn’t play cricket in England, the place where it was invented, in June, the month where more of it has been played than any other.And a couple more ticket price emails, which have some very useful detail. Thanks everyone. Starting with Andrew Cosgrove.“Prices for tickets were in line with perceived demand, so the most expensive matches were those involving England, India and Pakistan. On the other hand, I don’t think Ind vs Pak was any more expensive than Eng vs Anyone. There were about four bands of prices, with the lower one being cheap - tickets for £18 were available, mostly for games involving Afghanistan or Bangladesh. It doesn’t seem that unreasonable. India vs Pakistan was the most oversubscribed sporting event in this country since the 2012 Olympics, making the tickets cheaper just would have made it carnage.”I can understand that logic, but the unfortunate corollary is that it reduces demand by financial clout. So basically it’s a sporting body saying it will alleviate the pressure by limiting access to wealthier people. Not exactly an unprecedented strategy in our society, but not one that survives ethical scrutiny for me.Ishfaq Razzak, meanwhile, writes that “it’s been really difficult to get tickets through the ballot but I get it, everyone wants tickets and it’s a fair way of doing it. I managed to get tickets to the Pakistan v Sri Lanka match (rained off) at £20 but the Pakistan v India match was close to a hundred! Pakistan v India is the hottest ticket around, I’ve seen offers at £800 (that’s cheap) to £1700 for Gold tickets.“It looks like the punters that have bought extra tickets are selling for at least double, I bought Pakistan v NZ at £40 ea whereas face value is £20. It’s been 20 years since the last World Cup here so I guess there’s no other way to buy tickets from friends  touts if you don’t get selected. I paid £95 (face value) to a friend who managed to get Pakistan v Bangladesh at Lord’s on 5th July. Warner stand, terrace, front row, Gold tickets. Seems like an okay price when compared to football ticket prices. Friend is selling the remaining two tickets at £150 each and he’s getting lots of interest. See you at Lord’s.”Indeed. I don’t want to know what tickets to the final will cost, especially if a couple of teams in light blue make the cut. And that umpire inspection has led to an announcement of another umpire inspection, at 3pm. Layers within layers. Wait, wasn’t Inspection that movie with di Caprio and Joseph Gordon Levitt?Can someone photoshop the poster for me in the next few minutes?It’s time for another exciting episode of Umpire Walk, the show where umpires wander about and poke the ground with umbrellas. It’s all rather Lady Bracknell, prodding something with your brolly tip to see if it’s working or express your displeasure. Now they’re meeting with a delegation of ground staff to discuss the terms of their surrender. We’ve shifted narratives, now Tyrion Lannister may be involved. In other cricketing news, England’s women are taking on the West Indies down at Chelmsford. So there’s no rain (at the moment) out Essex way. Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones are off to a good start, they’re 40 without loss in the 10th over. But it looks like it might rain there soon, too.Beaumont has made 61 and 32 so far in this series, and Jones 18 and 91. So they’ll both be keen to stay out there as long as possible.“Welcome Geoff,” writes Sreekanth Nandakumar, who is very kind to do so. “Am I the only Indian fan who hope the India-Pakistan match is abandoned due to rain ? The ICC has been charging exorbitant prices for all the India matches, especially the Pakistan one. If it is abandoned, they will be at least three quarters out of pocket which will give me absolute happiness. The UK government have even increased the visa price to the UK from Europe to around 230 Euros from 100 Euros two years back, which is insane. It is only around 20 euros to fly from BrusselsCologne to London. Normal fans have been abandoned and I see that the rain gods are not happy with that.”This is an interesting point. I didn’t realise that the ticket prices had spiked for specific games at this tournament. If anyone else has experience of this, let me know about it. What have you paid for tickets, officially? How did it vary by match? What have you paid for tickets from scalpers  touts? Drop me an email or a tweet.For context on rainy venues, here are Ric Finlay’s numbers referring to Australia’s most recent World Cup.“Afternoon Geoff,” writes Simon McMahon. “In the absence of any actual cricket, I’m getting my summer reading list in order, and so have just ordered a copy of ‘Steve Smith’s Men’, written coincidentally by someone with the same name as your good self. Any idea if it’s any good?”Simon, all I can tell say is that the man in a charlatan of the highest order. I don’t know him but I don’t trust him. I certainly don’t trust a word he wrote. Also I believe that e-book sales give him a better royalty than paper copies, but also that giving physical books as gifts is a fine way to express love or friendship.What has particularly interested me over the last week or so is how angry some people are at the fact that it’s raining. Lots of comments about how this is all the ICC’s fault or England’s fault or someone’s fault, and that the World Cup should never have been staged here, or should have been at a different time of year, or something. The interesting part is that every cricket country has rain, and washouts, and abandonments. I seem to recall sitting through a lot of rained out Tests over Boxing Day and the New Year’s week in Melbourne and Sydney. A lot of two-session days in Sri Lanka. The 2016 World T20 in India, where they played that blockbuster against Pakistan at what felt like midnight after delaying and delaying a rain-affected start in Kolkata. That was after a decision a week or so earlier to move the match from Dharamsala, where I was stationed, and where I can attest that we saw more than our share of Himalayan rain, deluges, and a massive hailstorm that blocked the roads in and out of town for a night.So, yes. Rain. It happens. Sometimes more and sometimes less than others. Maybe English grounds could look at covering their whole outfields though, so we could have got some play during the reprieves on a day like this. The rain seems to have stopped, incidentally. But even if we had full ground covers today, I can’t see that we could have got more than about 20 overs in so far.It’s testament to the hardy types that cricket attracts that there are any people still at the ground. Surely this is going to be a washout. The umpires had two hour-long delays to try to give the ground time to dry while it wasn’t raining. Now it’s raining all over that ground again. And yet the stands are a good portion full of optimistic souls in outdoor wear, wandering about with hoods up, chatting and eating their snacks and listening to a playlist that has obviously been lifted from a mid-popularity fast fashion store. Bless your dreams, all of you.Hello all. Today, we are all Virat Kohli in a beanie, leaning out of a window looking sad and cold. Who would want Virat to be sad? Monsters. But one cannot reason with weather. We drove up from Taunton to Nottingham last night through hours of teeming motorway rain, a real Douglas Adams sequence of different types of downpour. And here we are, with Type 72 (misting persistent drizzle that makes you much wetter than it has any right to by volume) causing a mushrooming of umbrellas all through the stands. And that, my friends, is me done. Thank you for making the last five hours fly by with your emails. Sure, we haven’t seen a ball bowled. And yes, we’re all very frustrated. But I hope we’ve learned a thing or two about drones along the way. What more could one want? For the next stint, I wish Geoff Lemon, to my right, good health and dry weather. Talk to you all again over the weekend. Bye! “A genuine query,” in from Avitaj Mitra. “With the washouts so far (and the potential for more in future), I’d say it’s not beyond the realms of impossibility to assume that two teams might end up with identical records. (Even the NRR might be same). Say this is the case for the 4th spot. Which team progresses in that case? (Before you say head to head result, what if the match between those two teams was also washed out?) A pretty little dilemma for the ICC, eh?”If my decade in politics taught me one thing, whenever you go through a process like this, eventually, at some stage, you end up drawing lots. This might be that.Alternatively. “Why not get all the teams together and play a game of musical chairs?” asks Uma Venkatraman. “Last four standing are the semi-finalists. Between now and July 14, there will be enough reserve days for two matches and the final.” John Little rounding us out for the time being with a bit of Old Fashioned Commonsense. “Can’t they just have reserve days starting now? It’s not bloody village cricket and they have a wedding to go to tomorrow or work on monday. How hard can it be to arrange a cricket match when even the ICC can manage it?”Harder than it sounds, according to the ICC’s statement on Monday in relation to this topic. These are massive events. But if they had their time again... This is a pretty cool radar type thing. Thanks to John Morrissey, who emailed it through earlier. It reads: “Light rain stopping in 20 min., starting again 25 min. later.” Rinse and repeat. “By the time England and Wales’s turn comes around again for the CWC,” begins John Starnuck, “meteorologists might have got even better at long-term forecasts. Not that this would necessarily be taken into account after all, who would schedule a tour of Sri Lanka during the monsoon season? Oh. Still, built-in reserve days, plus possible extensions to a day’s play to 10pm would still be worth it.”I’m a little bit worried what this will do to England’s reputation. Talking to several senior World Cup officials a few weeks before the tournament, I asked them all the same question: what keeps you up at 2am? They all said rain. “Talking of great songs,” wrote Abhijato Sensarma a while back. “Surely one wouldn’t mind if I nominate ‘Stand By’? I wasn’t that impressed by it at first, since it wasn’t exactly World Cup-esque, but those thoughts have been long abandoned... LORYN and Rudimental have composed an absolute BANGER for the ages!” I’m with you. They have nailed it with the song. On what happens if rain hits later in the comp, Andrew Gladwin has the skinny, and it is as we assumed.“If both days of the semi-finals are rained off, then higher place in the round-robin table goes through –and if final rained-off, trophy shared,” he says. “But surely the ICC should now be looking at creative ways to settle rained-out knock-out matched in the highly likely event that it happens –how about a dance-off with the Strictly Come Dancing judges?” I DECLARE A THUMB WAR!“Surely this is the kind of game where both sides would probably take the rain off,” suggests Kevin Wilson. “Helps then both with qualification seeing as they’re both likely to make the SFs.”At this stage, I’m sure that will be the chat in the dressing room. It is still raining, although not as heavily as it was 10 minutes ago when it was sheeting down.Semi-heavily. Actually, upgrade that to quite heavily. We aren’t far away from Geoff Lemon taking the baton at Trent Bridge, would you believe. I’ll get through as many emails as I can before that special ceremony takes place. “Thanks for your perseverance!” Thanks for being part of it, William Stenhouse. “I just saw that the women’s one day is at The CloudFM County Ground, so that seems apt. Still, you can multitask and OBO both of them.”Like playing two pianos, it can be done but I wouldn’t advise it. Whenver I think of the CloudFM, I wonder whether one day we can get the HatFM County Ground.Check out The Spin podcast! Subscribe in all the usual places with the excellent Emma John and her rotating panel of pundits. I’m on next week, from memory.I said that we were moving on from roof chat, and we are. But I can’t resist this from Tom Carver. “Tor Turner is on the right track but not quite there. What they need is a stadium sized one of these. Apparently Harrow school in Beijing has one over its sports fields (to keep the air pollution out), so they must come in fairly large sizes.”Hold on. You’re telling me the answer might be... a BIODOME?! Pauly Shore, at last it is your time to shine again. A lot of angry emails about rain and England and so on. Evidently last year was the outlier and it is normally very wet in June here. I suppose they could have played this in August and the Ashes in June? Alternatively, they might ban England from hosting it in 20 years from now when it is next their turn. Given broadcasters are now likely to miss an Indian fixture, you couldn’t rule that out.“Following the Guarding OBO for quite some time now, have to say its really entertaining especially when the weather is like this.” Thanks, Kshitij Sikawar in Delhi. We’re giving it our best. “We want reserve days!”There were reserve days in 1999, of course. Indeed, it allowed England vs India to continue on a second day, the hosts eliminated after collapsing. Had the game been washed out, they would have progressed to the Super Six. It was Zimbabwe’s mighty win (Neil Johnson’s masterpiece) over South Africa in Chelmsford, as rain fell in Birmingham, which set up that crazy final day in the groups. Check it out. A good time to return to drones and tarps, then. Ian Forth is with me but doesn’t want to “enter the Beefy phase of my life and grumble to anyone who’ll listen.” Lucky, then, that we have solutions. Tor Turner has just travelled from Manchester to London and “can confirm it was raining every place the train passed through,” which is far from ideal. It’s given him time to think, though. “In terms of roofs, inflatable ones would be the way to go. I know it sounds weird but stay with me.” Oh, don’t worry, I’m with you. “This company reckons it could be manufactured off site and installed in a single night. I’d like to see them manage that for a stadium mind.”Be right back, off to throw my wallet at them for all the shares they’ll give me.Elbert Matt Loubser is also into my inbox on the topic, from South Africa. He’s not keen. “I am an engineer, but not of the structural persuasion. Greatest challenges with implementing a temporary roof are matters such as the mechanics required for relatively quick setup or breakdown (rain cover times 20), man-power wouldn’t cut it and the machines required would have to be integrated with the structure of the stadium (including lighting). Cost and inconvenience would lead architects to rather install a permanent roof. But indoor cricket is another matter how high would the roof have to be? Will grass-care be assured? What will the white-clad Test Match officials have to say about this sudden change? It’s just not on.”Drones, though. Drones with tarps. With gutters that manage the flow. Et voila!Last but not least for now, M. B. Anand with his first ever email to the OBO! Welcome to the club. Make sure it is not your last.“Very interesting ideas - holding up a tarp with drones or balloons,” he begins. “Some quick calculations below to check feasibility:Problem is power. Considering most stay aloft for about half hour and the very best, costing around $7500, can last no more than a couple of hours before needing re-juicing, this is likely to be a problem.Of course, we could arrange a complicated “change of guard” as drones rotate in and out constantly....With a ground, say a circle of about 80m, the tarp weight is about 12183 kg. Given that a cubic foot of air lofts about 7 g of weight, this translates to a large spherical balloon of about 150 ft. in diameter. About a third of the size of the ground. Or many smaller ones that add up to the same volume. That seems quite feasible. Balloon wins, I think. Let’s do this!”This started with a shadecloth in space and has morphed into a hot air balloon. I’m proud of the progression. But I think, for now, I’m going to move this conversation on. Thanks for the many, many emails on it. It’s been fun. Of course it is. Within five minutes of the inspection announcement, all the covers are on again. This is the heaviest it has been since 10:15am, I’m afraid. I’m not even going to say it this time. And guess what: it’s dark again, too. I must say, your emails today are outstanding. There are a lot of them, so please don’t be angry with me if they don’t all get the attention they deserve. “Any mathematicians out there?” asks Ian Forth. “Is a compressed game likely to have a disproportionate effect on a net run rate?”“So you are telling me there is not one ICC authority member that figured out that a World Cup in England could have some serious rain affected matches? yells Hugo. “Really poor planning on their behalf accoring to me.”I can’t sign up to that one. There was 2mm of rain here last June. It sucks but it happens. Check out the days rained out during Sydney Tests over the years. But the broader point about planning, well, back to my giant umbrella bit shortly.“It’s now 5am in Edmonton in Western Canada and the games start at 3.30 am and we are anxiously huddled around the TV, but this totally sucks!!!” adds Mike Weerasooriya. Thanks for sticking it out. I really hope this happens today. The crowd outside this morning were just brilliant. Three hours should do the trick.

But nobody in the first six groups has made one yet, and in any case, this being the historically difficult US Open, it’s surely more appropriate to record the first bogey. Sam Saunders’ playing partner Carlos Ortiz has that dubious honour, dropping a shot at 1 and illustrating the importance of not finding the thicker, lusher rough off the tee. A weekender-style hack-out was his only option, a dropped shot the inevitable consequence. And the first double-bogey of the week has just been made by the 20-year-old Taiwanese amateur Kevin Yu, who couldn’t extricate himself from the thick stuff down the right of the long par-four 2nd, and he’s +2. He won’t be the last.Here we go then ... and the first shot of this year’s US Open has been hit by Sam Saunders, the 31-year-old grandson of the 1960 champion Arnold Palmer. The USGA deliberately put Saunders out first in order to honour the legacy of the King. It’s safe to say Saunders won’t be reaching the stellar heights of his grandfather - his best (and only) previous performance at a major was tie for 50th at Chambers Bay in the 2015 US Open - but at least he whistled this opening tribute down the fairway, en route to making par.Only one man has ever won the US Open in three consecutive years. Step forward Willie Anderson of North Berwick, Scotland, who emigrated to the States as a teenager and won the national championship on four occasions, in 1901, 1903, 1904 and 1905. Before his first victory, at the Myopia Hunt Club in Massachusetts, all competitors were informed that they were to dine in the kitchen, as professionals were not allowed in the clubhouse due to their reputation for boozing, carousing, effing and jeffing. Anderson responded to this news by hacking up some huge ots while shouting “naw naw naw” in a trenchant manner. Not long after, a tent was hastily erected by petrified officials and the players were able to eat their luncheon in comfort.The sensational Brooks Koepka could repeat Anderson’s three-peat this week. The 2017 and 2018 champion is the hottest thing in golf right now. The world number one recently decimated the field at the PGA, winning his fourth major title in his last eight (!) attempts. Throw in a tie for second at this year’s Masters, and we’re dealing with the sort of domination not seen since Tiger in his pomp. And like Anderson before him, he performs best when he’s propelled by a little heat under the collar. His latest PGA win was fuelled by a perceived lack of respect from the punditocracy now he’s raging because Fox Sports didn’t feature him in one of their four US Open trailers. The fact that he’s in the other three, and that one of those is about him alone, isn’t the point. Koepka’s got the funk on. Everyone else watch out!Speaking of Tiger in his pomp ... the great man’s back at the scene of his record-breaking win in 2000. He shot 65-69-71-67 - the level-par 71 was the best round, incidentally, made with wind whipping in from Carmel Bay and sending the rest of the field into a flat spin - and ended the week at -12, a mere 15 shots clear of second-placed Miguel Angel Jimenez and Ernie Els. Having finally won major number 15 at Augusta in April, the Tiger tail is up and he fancies this one. He’s one of four short-priced favourites, along with Koepka and former champions Dustin Johnson (second at the Masters and the PGA) and Rory McIlroy (winner last week in Canada after coming very close to a 59).Also much fancied this week: the in-form Patrick Cantlay, a resurgent Jordan Spieth, the 2013 winner Justin Rose, eternal bridesmaid Rickie Fowler, the grind-lovin’ Justin Thomas, the super-consistent Xander Schauffele, Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Adam Scott, Hideki Matsuyama ... we could go on.

Rafe Spall starred in the original play and will reprise his role for the new production, which is a 90-minute one-man show.“What we’re exploring is identity, a sense of powerlessness, of the guilt and shame that we have as a nation, especially about our inertia,” Dyer said in 2014. “The play highlights our anger at not feeling good enough about ourselves and the blame we apportion to other people for our own inabilities.”On Thursday Dyer told the  that in a post-Brexit world the issues brought up in the original microplay resonated more. “At the time there were people saying ‘Oh God, the football stadiums are different now, why are you always going on about racism?’ Now they understand. In the stadiums we still feel it, in the job market we still feel it, in the world we still feel it.”Dyer said becoming the first black British artist to have written, starred in and directed at the National Theatre was a huge achievement. “It’s a wonderful thing. I suppose within that it isn’t the usual question of ‘why’s it not happened before?’ I can’t think of anyone else apart from Simon Burney and Harold Pinter. It’s a very exclusive club and I’m very proud of it as an artist, regardless of colour. It’s a brilliant achievement and really unusual.”The US playwright Annie Baker will premiere her play The Antipodes and is one of six women who will direct during the season. Katy Rudd directs an adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane Fiona Buffini directs her sister Moiras play Manor Melly Still directs My Brilliant Friend Nadia Fall directs Three Sisters and Chloe Lamford co-directs The Antipodes with Baker.“With My Brilliant Friend, Paradise and Manor we’re seeing the major stages dominated by female artists for the first time in the theatre’s history,” said the National’s co-chief executive Rufus Norris. “Adaptations of classics are a theme and it’s fantastic to have Kate Tempest make her debut.”After it unveiled its previous season in March the theatre was heavily criticised as all six plays were written by men and only one was directed by a woman. “What’s changed is us putting our hands up and saying we got it wrong,” said Lisa Burger, the other co-chief executive. “We should have been better prepared to talk about balance in the announcement we were making. We’ve got much better at representation and this season shows that.”April De Angelis’s adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend, which was made for television in 2018, will come to the Olivier theatre. Fall, who is Theatre Royal Stratford East’s artistic director, will direct Inua Ellams’ adaptation of Chekhov’s Three Sisters, which will be relocated to Nigeria, and her play Welcome to Iran will come to the National in May 2020.Burger said: “This season shows that British theatre is thriving and well. I’m really proud of the range of the work that we’ve got here, with big themes.”Tony Kushner’s adaptation of Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s The Visit will star Lesley Manville, and Maxine Peake will star in Lucy Kirkwood’s The Welkin alongside Cecilia Noble. Another playwright making her National Theatre debut is Francesca Martinez with All of Us, which she also stars in and which is directed by Ian Rickson.The lineup is completed by Richard Bean and Oliver Chris’s new play Absolute Flies Again Alexander Zeldin’s Faith, Hope and Charity Chris Bush’s adaptation of Brecht’s The Caucasian Chalk Circle and Robert Lepage directs a new edition of Ex Machina’s epic The Seven Streams of the River Ota.Burger and Norris also announced the National Theatre Collection, which will give libraries, schools and universities access to some of the 10 years’ worth of NT Live productions that were originally shown in cinemas around the UK. The service will go live in September and feature Simon Godwin’s version of Twelfth Night, starring Tamsin Greig, Danny Boyle’s Frankenstein and 13 other plays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37de9b683e104cf2334f25e9368a01c378638096/0_0_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f82a8ac8f4fcd7b7afc64aa9ecbb8801","title":"seven ways to make windows 10 work better","story":"FlintyMcQwerty asked for tips to fix or avoid problems with the operating systemPlease share all your favourite tips, tricks and techniques for harnessing the power, panache and pulchritude of Windows 10. (Apologies, Jack, for my ineluctable tendency to alliterate.) FlintyMcQwertyLast week’s answer provoked a lot of discussion about Windows 10. I can’t do anything about the more hysterical complaints but many issues can be resolved by spending a few minutes in the settings app. I’m therefore accepting FlintyMcQwerty’s invitation to explain a few of them.The one thing you have to accept is that Windows 10, like Windows 8, has two applications programming interfaces, and both are required to meet the needs of a changing world. There’s an old API for traditional programs run with a mouse, and a new one for finger-friendly apps that work on touchscreen tablets and convertibles.Tens of millions of us are already using Windows 10 devices with touchscreens and we may well become the majority. However, “modern” apps are now opened, resized and closed in exactly the same way as traditional programs and they work perfectly well with mice, so why complain about them? It’s not a fundamental change like the one from character-based MS-DOS to graphical Windows.In fact, anyone who learned how to use Windows 95 when it came out should have no problem running Windows 10 today. The basic elements of a Start menu, a taskbar and clickable icons haven’t changed, even if the implementations look a little different.The quickest and easiest way to run programs in Windows 10 is to pin them to the taskbar, where they are very visible and only a click away. You should have at least nine of your most-used programs pinned because you can run them by pressing the shortcut combination of the Windows Key plus a number. WinKey-5 will run the fifth program in the line with no need to switch to the mouse. Keep the order the same and you’ll soon learn which is which.There are other ways to run programs you don’t use very often. The hallowed method is to put their icons on the desktop. The modern alternative is to pin the program’s icon to the Start menu, creating a Live Tile, which is mainly an icon in a box. The advantages are that it’s bigger and much easier to hit it’s not cluttering up your desktop and it’s not buried at the bottom of a long menu.Remove all the tiles you don’t want (right-click and select “unpin from Start”), resize the panel and group the tiles you need at the top. After that, you can run programs quickly by hitting the Windows key to open the Start menu, then clicking a tile. This is much easier than scrolling down the Start menu, especially when many programs are in sub-menus.One reader missed the “jump list”, which provided Start menu access to recently used files in Windows 7. They have not gone away. First, you get a jump list of recently used files by right-clicking an icon on the taskbar. Second, there’s a list of 20 recently used files in the “quick access” panel in file explorer. Third, the new task view provides access to the hundreds you may have used over the past few days.If your file explorer shows default folders such as documents and pictures, you can scroll up to find the “quick access” section, which has bookmarks for files and folders. If you want to get to a folder very quickly, right-click it and select “pin to quick access” to bookmark it. (Another option is “pin to Start”.)To change the default setting, open file explorer, go to the view tab, and click the down-arrow, under options on the far right. Next, select “change folder and search options” from the drop-down menu. The top line of the resulting panel says “open file explorer to:”, and you can choose either “this PC” or “quick access”.There’s an even easier way to return to something you were doing earlier: click its thumbnail image in Windows 10’s task view, aka timeline. You can call up the task view by clicking its white icon, which is next to the search box on the taskbar, or by pressing WinKey+Tab.Task view saves time-stamped thumbnails of files you have used recently. It’s usually easier to recognise and click a thumbnail than to pick a file name from a text menu.Scroll to the bottom of the task view for the option to store up to 30 days of activity online, rather than on your PC. This also lets you continue an activity on a different device. However, it may involve a loss of privacy, even if only Microsoft’s AI reads your data to make suggestions.To clear or manage your data, go to the privacy section of the settings (cogwheel) app and click “activity history”. This page has tick boxes for “store my activity history on this device” and “send my activity history to Microsoft”.Task view also lets you have multiple virtual desktops in Windows 10, simply by clicking “new desktop”. You can set up different desktops for different scenarios: one for work, one for email and one for social networking, for example. You can move rapidly between desktops by holding down Ctrl-WinKey and pressing a left or right arrow key, rather than going back to task view.Every virtual desktop has the same taskbar, icons and wallpaper but it’s cheaper than buying three or four monitors.Everybody uses a clipboard to copy something from one application and paste it into something else, usually by using Ctrl-C (copy) and Ctrl-V (paste). Windows 10’s clipboard has the option to store its history in the cloud. Now you can re-paste items you copied earlier, pin items you paste often, and copy things on one device and paste them on a different device. As with task view, there are privacy implications. However, you can control what’s allowed and clear your clipboard data from the clipboard page in the “system” section of the settings app.The cloud clipboard uses WinKey-V to paste, instead of Ctrl-V. Sadly, it doesn’t have the “smart paste” features that you get with Ctrl-Alt-V in Microsoft Word.You can have lots of different windows from different applications on screen at the same time but only one of them is “active”. However, it’s really useful to be able to scroll texts in background windows without having to click in them to make them active. To turn this feature on, go to the devices section in the settings app and open the mouse page. The last item is “scroll inactive windows when I hover over them”. Simply set the switch to on.Notifications are interruptions and Windows 10 makes it easy to avoid most of them. Go to the system section of the settings app and select the “notifications \u0026amp actions” page. You can turn off “the Windows welcome experience after updates” and Microsoft’s “tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows”. You can also go through all the apps that can send notifications and turn off the ones you don’t want to hear from, including “suggested”. Clicking an app’s icon provides fine tuning. You can allow text but turn off sounds, for example.You can also eliminate more suggestions from the personalisation section. Go to the lock-screen page to turn off “get fun facts, tips, and more from Windows and Cortana on your lock screen”. Go to the Start page to turn off “show suggestions occasionally in Start”.Also, if you don’t have Microsoft Office installed, it may be suggested. Do you have a program called Get Office in Your Start Menu? If so, you can right-click it and select “uninstall”.Maybe at least one of these tips will save you from getting stressed about something you can fix.

You could hear snatches of Swedish everywhere. When we queued up to buy water, both couples ahead of us were Swedes. An entire handball team from Gothenburg was going by rail to a tournament in Austria.“Sweden is trend-oriented: if there’s a new trend, everyone will follow it,” said Anna Maria Hilborn, an art teacher I met when my five-year-old son started spinning around a signpost on the platform with hers.Sweden’s flygskam, or flight shame, movement first came to notice in the summer of 2017 when the singer-songwriter Staffan Lindberg wrote an article co-signed by five of his famous friends, in which they announced their decision to give up flying. Among them were the popular ski commentator Björn Ferry, opera-singer Malena Ernman (the mother of climate activist Greta Thunberg), and Heidi Andersson, the eleven-times world champion arm-wrestler.“The big thing, of course, was the very warm summer last year,” Hilborn told me once we were on the train to the Rhineland city of Duisburg, the German countryside rattling by outside. “I think it affected people because it usually isn’t that hot in Sweden. It had an impact on farmers: they had to slaughter some of their animals early. And people felt it, too, of course.”Seeing the effects of climate change in the here and now made Hilborn decide that next time she took her annual trip to visit her brother in Innsbruck, Austria, she would go by train.“My personal impact won’t change a lot,” she said. “But when a percentage of people start doing something it creates a new norm. So, just by being a part of that movement and sharing it, I’m doing something.”After nearly eight years living in Malmö, I’m perhaps Swedish enough to start following national trends such as flygskam, which made the official list of new Swedish words for 2018. I signed up to the country’s Flygfritt 2019 (Flight Free 2019) campaign in February – even though, strictly speaking, I had already failed, as I’d flown to the UK at the start of January.Using the calculator on the International Railways Union’s EcoPassenger site, I realised that by taking the train, rather than flying, on my four annual visits back to the UK would cut my annual CO2 emissions by about 1.8 tonnes, if you adjust for the impact of emitting at height. That is close to half the total annual carbon emissions, excluding flights, of the average person living in Sweden. To me it seemed crazy to pass up that kind of reduction to save a few days and a few hundred pounds.“Your poor children,” my stepmother said after I announced my plan to travel overland from Malmö to my parents’ home in Surrey. My wife, while supportive, had nightmare visions of me and the children stranded on a cold station platform for the night. Though the truth is that seven-year-old Eira and five-year-old Finn loved it. In each direction, they got more than 24 hours of nearly non-stop parental attention, unlimited screen time, and Lego sets and craft equipment bought by their Swedish mum.There was the excitement of passing through five countries – Denmark, Germany, Belgium and France on the way out, plus the Netherlands on the way back – and the thrill of racing through the French countryside at 186 mph on Eurostar. At the good-value A\u0026ampO hostel we stayed at in Hamburg, Eira was inexplicably reduced to hysterical laughter by the large selection of goodies you could sprinkle on top of your yoghurt at the breakfast buffet.On the train to Duisburg, at 3½ hours the longest single leg of the journey, I also met Elin Persson and her husband Morgon, on their way to Málaga with their four children. Like Hilborn, Morgon is an artist: a glass-blower who transforms used wine and beer bottles into vases. Elin Persson conceded that many of the Swedes she had seen travelling fitted a particular demographic. And it is true that the success of the flygskam movement has generated a backlash, with politicians and columnists in Sweden attacking it as a form of one-upmanship: one where middle-class Swedes sneer at their working-class compatriots for taking charter flights to Thailand or the Canary Islands.“Mostly, it is now middle-class, but hopefully it will spread,” said Susanna Elfors, co-founder of the Tågsemester (Train Holiday) Facebook group which over the last year has gained 90,000 members.I’d been thrown together with the Perssons by a 20-minute signalling delay that meant we all risked the same domino-chain of missed connections.“You are the group leader,” the conductor informed me with mock formality as he shared my route, which had slightly better connections, with other Brussels-bound passengers. In the end, we had just four minutes to rush down the underpass and up to the right platform in Duisberg – with Finn on my shoulders, my wheeled suitcase trundling behind and Eira gamely struggling to keep up.We made it, but the experience underlines the risk of international train journeys in a system not yet designed for them. Instead of buying a ticket all the way to your final destination – as was the case before budget flights replaced international rail travel – a sequence of shorter journeys is now purchased. With the ticket I bought online from Loco2, we had reserved seats on specific Eurostar and German Intercity-Express (ICE) trains. If we missed a connection, we would have no right to take a later one.In the days before I left Malmö, I’d regretted not making more of a holiday of it. Aside from an hour and a bit in Brussels, our only stop longer than 20 minutes was the hour and a half we had in Osnabrück on the return leg. We did manage to entertain ourselves, however.Although no one said anything, German travellers seemed less indulgent of small children than those back home in Sweden. But the comfortable table seats we had booked on the German ICE trains were perfect for drawing, playing Lego and making wool pom-poms. The short trips we had on standing-only overcrowded local trains in Germany and the Netherlands were more difficult.We stayed away from the decent-looking ICE restaurant cars selling German food, such as currywurst and beef gulasch, but indulged ourselves whenever the trolley selling drinks and pretzel breads passed by (although coming from cash-free Sweden, I was astonished they didn’t take cards).In Brussels, we visited an overpriced restaurant outside the station to try the national dish – some of the worst mussels I have ever eaten. I made up for the disappointment on the return leg, by gorging on deep-fried mussels from Hoekse Vishandel outside the Hook of Holland ferry terminal.“Are there places like this all over the Netherlands?” I asked the owner. “There are,” he said. “But we’re the best.”In Osnabrück, a city in north-west Germany, we missed the medieval centre and renowned zoo but met an engineering student in Burger King who kept the children spellbound as he explained the workings of his self-built electric skateboard.On the 45-minute ferry from Germany to the Danish island of Lolland, the children threw themselves around in the wind so wildly on deck that they fell asleep as soon as we got onto the rail replacement bus to Copenhagen. Indeed, Finn was so exhausted that when, an hour later, he threw up half-digested spaghetti bolognese over his sister, he didn’t even wake up. By that time all we had left was a hop over the Öresund Straits, and a short cycle home to our apartment where, at well past midnight, the children were greeted by their relieved mother.The trip took two more days than it would have if we’d flown, but they weren’t days wasted. They might even be the best I’ve spent with Eira and Finn all year.Carbon emissions from Malmö to London By train: 53.9kg.

The presidential candidate has made jogging part of his election toolkit, from his campaign against the decidedly less athletic Ted Cruz, to repeated 5km jaunts across Iowa as he bids for the 2020 Democratic nomination.Wednesday morning saw O’Rourke’s latest display of physical prowess, as the former Texas congressman popped up in New York to run two miles with LGBTQ activists. O’Rourke is due shortly to launch a series of policies to protect gay rights.O’Rourke turned up right on time, ready for action. The 47-year-old was decked out in full running garb for the two-mile jog, mid-thigh shorts displaying willowy legs. He was wearing an Iowa Cubs baseball hat, which seemed on message given the importance of the Hawkeye State in the Democratic primaries.“Everybody ready to run?” O’Rourke asked the roughly 30 people who had assembled on a popular running path close to the Hudson River. There was a muted response. “Two miles is all we’re doing,” he added, which served to lift spirits a little.With that, O’Rourke bolted off down the pathway, surrounded by people who appeared to have varied levels of commitment to running. Most were wearing the customary shorts, T-shirts and trainers, but one man had opted for the less orthodox white denim jeans, while another wore cut-offs.Paul Humphries was dressed more traditionally, in shorts and a rainbow-emblazoned Beto for Senate T-shirt, although confessed he was not much of a trackman.“I am a runner, although not a very good one,” he said. Humphries is originally from Texas and has been living in New York for the past 15 years. Despite the Beto T-shirt, he is yet to choose a candidate to support. “It’s too early to say,” he said. “I’m still open. But I think Beto’s an important part of the conversation we’re having.”The O’Rourke campaign said the run was “in honor of Pride month”, and coincided with the unveiling of several LGBTQ-focused policies. As president, O’Rourke would take executive action to reverse Donald Trump’s ban on trans people in the military, his team said, and would create a universal healthcare system “with explicit protections against discrimination”.O’Rourke said: “Too many LGBTQ+ people still lack protection under many states’ laws and the current administration is encouraging rather than stamping out discrimination. We must ensure all Americans are treated equally no matter who they are or who they love.”O’Rourke has been criticized for an early lack of specific policy ideas – and a perceived sense of entitlement – but the Human Rights Campaign, in endorsing O’Rourke for the Senate in 2018, described him as a “proven champion of equality”. Runner Nora Moore said: “He’s an ally of so many marginalized communities and I think he walks the walk and I find that inspirational in a politician.”Moore, 36, was running with a stroller containing her four-year-old daughter Fiona. She said she has trained for two half-marathons in this fashion, and showed no signs of fatigue as the runners headed towards the finish. O’Rourke is Moore’s choice for the nomination “as of right now” she has been volunteering for his campaign in New York.She said: “I’m one of those complicit iniduals who sort of was asleep at the wheel a little bit, thought everything was great, assumed my girl Hillary was going to win, and then when it didn’t happen I just got really invested in being more involved.”Despite that, O’Rourke was defiant when the  asked about his drooping numbers.“There’s no poll taken in June the year before a presidential election that accurately predicted the outcome,” he said. He pointed to low polling numbers during his Texas Senate race.“We cannot allow polls to determine our chances. Nor as president will I allow polls to determine what we focus on. We’ll do what is right for the right reasons, regardless of the political consequences.”As for the run, O’Rourke showed no sign of tiring, unlike the .

We want your toes,’” Griffiths told the . “I thought it was a bit of a joke, really.”It was not. For more than 40 years, visitors have flocked to the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City for a chance to try the country’s most famous drink: the Sourtoe Cocktail.The beverage consists of a mummified human toe floating in a whiskey shot patrons must let the digit – or its blackened nail – touch their lips in order to receive a certificate and qualify for admittance to the Sourtoe Cocktail Club.Upon returning home to Bolton, Griffiths learned he would lose three of his toes to the frostbite. He asked the surgeon to keep them.During his recovery, he began corresponding with the Downtown Hotel about possibly donating the digits, but his physical rehabilitation and work hours complicated plans to travel to Yukon.Months passed and Griffiths kept his toes in jars “just in my bedside drawer”. Finally, after much back and forth with the hotel, he suggested simply mailing them to Canada.At the post office, he panicked after being asked what was in the polythene envelope.“I couldn’t think of anything. I didn’t want to just blatantly lie and say it was a candle or whatever.” He told the postal clerk he was mailing his toes – and wrote “Novelty gift” on the envelope.He kept one of the toes as “insurance” because, he said: “I’m not sure really you should be posting toes.”More than a month later, the toes arrived in Dawson City. “We couldn’t be happier to receive a new toe. They are very hard to come by these days,” said the hotel in a statement.Terry Lee, the hotel’s “toe expert” will now preserve the digits in rock salt for at least six weeks before they are served in whiskey.“The big toe is the money toe,” Lee told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.“We usually don’t get frostbitten toes. Usually, they’re from gout or diabetes, or they’re lawnmowers or chainsaws or accidents … to get a frostbitten toe, that’s phenomenal.” There are currently three toes in use.In recent years, the hotel has grappled with a spate of toe thefts, and the hotel now nails anyone who attempts to swipe a toe with a fine of C$2,500 (£1,500).The establishment is not trying to convince Griffiths to make the trip to the Yukon to try the cocktail. He is not sure if anyone has ever sipped the whiskey with their own toe swirling around, but is keen to be the first.“People look at you as though you’re a bit mad, he said. “But I think it’s a nice little bit of fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92290ee107330add4cdb94abc658b22d6b2618ed/0_168_3677_2206/master/3677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=753db7a8838f52317625aaf9b14bb44f","title":"hungary eyes science research as latest target for state control","story":"Academy will be managed by nationalist government in unprecedented moveThe Hungarian government is moving to bring the country’s umbrella scientific research organisation under its control, in what scientists in the country and globally say would be an unprecedented assault on academic freedoms.The far-right, anti-migration government of Viktor Orbán has sought to increase its control over numerous sectors of society since it came into office in 2010, including putting financial pressure on independent media outlets, harassing and taxing NGOs that work on issues such as migration, and moving to centralise historical research.Most notably, the Central European University, an English-language institution founded by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, is being forced to move some of its operations to Vienna after a long battle with the government.The country’s Academy of Sciences appears to be the latest target for increased state control. The academy consists of a society of distinguished scientists and intellectuals, alongside a broad research network of 15 institutes and 150 research groups comprising about 3,000 scientific researchers.The government’s plan would separate these institutes from the main academy, and create a governing board in which government-appointed delegates would have a majority. Parliament, which is dominated by Orbán’s Fidesz party, is currently debating the bill. It is expected to be passed and come into force by 1 September.Hungarian government officials say it is reasonable for the government to have a say in how state funding is used.“The academy of sciences is a sovereign institution, but not independent from national interests,” said the foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, at a conference in Bratislava last week. “It’s obvious that they should make research in areas and directions which are important from the perspective of the future competitiveness of the country.”Scientists at the academy, however, believe the move is punishment for criticism of the Orbán government made by social science researchers.“We were never afraid to criticise the government if research showed policies that were problematic,” said Emese Szilágyi, who coordinates an institute representing researchers at the academy. “The illiberal government here has reorganised many sectors already and it’s clear that this attack against the academy fits into a chain of events.”She said the vast majority of academy employees were against the plan and said they would use “every available option” to try to stop it from taking effect.László Palkovics, Hungary’s minister for trade and industry, has previously criticised the academy for straying into politics. “Their job is to give scientific advice and recommendations,” he said in an interview with a pro-government web portal last year. “In some cases the academy has moved towards being politically active and this is not their task.”László Lovász, a mathematician and the president of the academy, said there was a misunderstanding about the role of social sciences among government figures, and said criticism was legitimate if evidence-based research ended up suggesting government policy was flawed.“Research in sociology, economics, political science, can have criticism concerning certain policies, and I think it’s reasonable for the government to listen to this criticism. That is different from politics where you try to change the government,” he said at a press conference held at the academy’s grand building in central Budapest on Wednesday.Lovász said while social sciences could be the most affected by the plan, natural science could also suffer, and the shakeup would make long-term research projects and “any research beyond government priorities increasingly difficult to follow”.He said trust had been eroded by the aggressive and “improper” way in which the government had conducted negotiations with the academy. He said the initial decision to reorganise the academy’s finances was communicated by email a year ago, and the academy was given just 54 minutes in which to respond.Antonio Loprieno, the president of the European Federation of Academies of Sciences and Humanities, said it was acceptable for a government to set broad parameters for research spending, but the Hungarian law was clearly aimed at giving the government “an inappropriate level of detail” in control over research.Loprieno said the Hungarian government’s moves were unprecedented in an EU country and a worrying sign of what might be tried by governments elsewhere. “So far we are not seeing it anywhere else, but it could happen in countries that are moving towards populist governments, where there is a disregard for science, and universities and scientific institutes could become targets,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e8bf10353e70f7cb494ac192f183649d5ea7b9b/82_113_2277_1366/master/2277.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dc1aac0f629f5658e766acca3e26b8d","title":"meps create biggest far right group in european parliament","story":"ID’s influence doubtful, however, after falling short of aim of being third biggest blocMarine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini’s MEPs have joined forces with anti-immigration parties across Europe to create the biggest far-right group in the European parliament.Despite promises to become “a thorn in the flesh of the establishment”, the group of 73 MEPs falls short of Salvini’s ambition of upending the system of EU lawmaking by becoming the third-largest group in the parliament.Identity and Democracy will be led by Marco Zanni, an MEP from Italy’s League party, which enjoyed stunning success in the European elections in Italy. The League is led by Salvini, who is also Italy’s deputy prime minister and the interior minister.The ID group failed to convince Nigel Farage and his Brexit party to join.Zanni, who met Farage earlier this month, said the door remained open to the Brexit party and others, such as Spain’s Vox. “We were unable to create a united group for a number of reasons with the Brexit party,” he told journalists at a launch press conference. “It’s not a defeat, it’s a very open relationship, we are open to them if they want to cooperate.” He said it was important for all parties with a “radically different view of Europe” to join forces.However, the ID group appears to strike a different tone to the Brexit party. The UK’s chaotic attempt to leave the EU has led Eurosceptic parties to drop or drastically tone down their demands to quit the bloc. “Some people say that we want to destroy the EU, I want to contradict that,” Jörg Meuthen, of the Alternative for Germany group, another ID member, told journalists.He said the new group wanted to work collaboratively, but sometimes that meant saying no. “The EU needs to be limited and reformed,” he said, adding “we are here to be a thorn in the flesh of the establishment”.Eurosceptic parties have long been split on big issues, such as relations with Russia. While the League and Le Pen’s National Rally have warm ties with the Kremlin, Scandinavian and Baltic far-right parties see Russia as a threat to be contained.Le Pen, who leads France’s National Rally part, formerly the National Front, said different opinions on issues such as Russian sanctions were not surprising, given different cultures and traditions. “On the big issues we have a common vision and we are here to show you that,” she said.In the European parliament, Eurosceptic right-wing populists have been scattered across four groups, limiting their influence.Jussi Halla-aho, of the Finns, a Finnish party allied with British Conservatives in the last parliament, said the Eurosceptic right had long been weakened by their failure to unite. Divisions remain present. Despite a threat of expulsion from the European People’s party, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, shows no sign of seeking to remove his Fidesz MEPs from that traditional centre-right bloc.Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party is expected to remain in the Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group.Farage is hoping to resurrect a separate Eurosceptic group, the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, which would allow him to retain his primetime speaking slot in European parliament debates.But he is having trouble finding allies. Under European parliament rules, a group must consist of MEPs from at least nine countries. Being in a group allows MEPs to benefit from more EU funds and the chance to get senior jobs in drafting EU legislation.The EFDD has been a marriage of convenience with Italy’s Five Star Movement, but the Italians have yet to commit to joining Farage again. An M5S source said an alliance with the Brexit party was neither agreed nor ruled out. Le Pen said her group was “more mature” than its predecessor, because some of the parties had served in government. She was speaking shortly after it emerged she would face trial in France over publishing images of Islamic State atrocities on Twitter in December 2015, confirmed by French judicial sources. She had tweeted the images after some French media carried comments comparing her party to Islamic State.Le Pen has called the legal proceedings “shameful”, saying she was wrongly being singled out by morally questionable ruling “elites”. Le Pen’s immunity to prosecution as a member of parliament was lifted in 2017 so she could be investigated over the Twitter images. A date has not yet been set for the trial.Additional reporting by Angelique Chrisafis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7956c054365da09c795f9e26001f7a25e0fb433/0_1_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=509cadcd5b38638396a61d575481b345","title":"mexico carolina herrera fashion designer cultural appropriation","story":"Does Carolina Herrera’s Resort 2020 line evoke ‘the playful and colourful mood of a Latin holiday’ or rip off indigenous designs? Three months after calling on Spain to apologise for its colonial abuses, the Mexican government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador has found a more contemporary and cultural bone to pick.The country’s culture minister, Alejandra Frausto, has written to the Venezuelan fashion designer Carolina Herrera to demand an explanation for her company’s use of indigenous Mexican designs in its latest collection.The label says its new Resort 2020 line “takes on the playful and colourful mood of a Latin holiday” and is about “visceral reactions of delight-eclectic patterns, unexpected silhouettes, pulsating energy”.It has certainly prompted an unexpected and energetic response from the Mexican government, which has asked the brand to explain why it is using designs “whose origins are well documented”.In a letter sent to Herrera and the company’s creative director, Wes Gordon, Frausto said: “This is a matter of ethical consideration that obliges us to speak out and bring an urgent issue to the UN’s sustainable development agenda: promoting inclusion and making those who are invisible visible.”The letter, seen by the Spanish newspaper El País, singled out certain designs.It claimed that one long white dress embroidered with bright animals, colours and flowers was derived from the culture of the Tenango de Doria community in Hidalgo state “where each piece of embroidery tells the story of the community and each element has a personal, family or community meaning”.Two other dresses, it added, incorporated elements from the famous traditional shawls of Saltillo in Coahuila state.In a statement, Carolina Herrera said the collection had been conceived as a “tribute to the richness of Mexican culture” and its craft techniques.“There’s an undeniable Mexican presence in this collection,” said Gordon. “It’s something that jumps out at you and I always intended it to be something latent as a way of showing my love for this country and for all the incredible work I’ve seen there.”The designer added: “My admiration for the artisanal work has only grown as I have travelled to Mexico over the years. With this new collection, I have tried to highlight the importance of this magnificent cultural heritage.”Last month, the Mexican government said a law would be brought before the senate to “tackle the plagiarism that different indigenous peoples and communities have suffered” by recognising them as the lawful owners of their cultural and identity elements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75cac366f5f8a1e2ac2024c0e632b42e9ad80f54/0_6_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab012340aaf345be5bf7c17fbcb440ef","title":"oil tankers blasts reports gulf of oman us navy","story":"Sailors evacuated from two tankers in distress near the strategic strait of HormuzTwo oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, leaving one ablaze and the other adrift, a month after a similar incident in which four tankers in the region were struck.The US navy’s fifth fleet said it was assisting the tankers, which issued distress calls near the strategic strait of Hormuz. The crew from both tankers were evacuated.Reports of the explosions originally came from the same Hezbollah-linked news agencies in Lebanon that correctly reported attacks on tankers docked off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in May. The US blamed those attacks on Iran – an accusation Tehran has denied.The suspected attacks occurred along one of the world’s busiest oil routes, and the price of oil surged as the initial reports emerged on Thursday.Front Altair was carrying 75,000 tonnes of naphtha, a petrochemical feedstock, when it suffered a suspected torpedo hit, according to Taiwan’s state oil refiner CPC, which chartered the vessel. Other unverified reports suggested a mine attack.The vessel was on fire but afloat, said its operator Frontline, denying a report by the Iranian news agency IRNA that it had sunk.The Kokuka Courageous was damaged in a suspected attack that breached the hull above the waterline while en route from Saudi Arabia to Singapore, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said. “The ship is safely afloat,” it added.Iranian state TV reported 44 crew had been evacuated from the tankers to an Iranian port.United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is part of the Royal Navy, said it was investigating. “We are deeply concerned by reports of explosions and fires on vessels in the strait of Hormuz. We are in contact with local authorities and partners in the region,” said a UK government spokeswoman.Tensions in the Gulf have been close to boiling point for weeks as the US puts “maximum economic pressure” on Iran in an attempt to force Tehran to reopen talks about the 2015 nuclear deal, which the US pulled out of last year.The timing of Thursday’s attack was especially sensitive because it came as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, held talks with the Iranian leadership in Tehran in an effort to find a basis for discussions between the US and Iran. The Japanese stressed they were not bringing specific messages from the US president, Donald Trump, and said nothing that they had heard in the first day of talks suggested a breakthrough was imminent.Japan’s trade ministry said the two oil tankers involved in Thursday’s incidents carried “Japan-related” cargo.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described Thursday’s developments as “suspicious” and implied that the fault lay with a person or group trying to damage his country.“Suspicious doesn’t begin to describe what likely transpired this morning,” he tweeted, adding that the incidents took place while Abe was meeting Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, “for extensive and friendly talks”. Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal. The US responds by imposing sanctions on Iran\u0027s metals industry.The EU urges Iran to respect the nuclear deal and says it plans to continue trading with the country despite US sanctions.\u0026nbspThe US says it will move a Patriot missile battery into the Middle East to counter threats from Iran.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.The US embassy in Baghdad orders all non-essential government staff to leave Iraq immediately.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone.

Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Semi-official media in Iran report it has quadrupled production of the low-enriched uranium used for civilian applications. Iran is allowed to enrich uranium, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal.Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Salman hosts high-level summits in Mecca. He calls on the international community to use all means to confront Iran and accuses them of being behind \u0027terrorist operations\u0027 that targeted Saudi oil interests.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift as 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.An inquiry by the UAE into the attacks on 12 May found the sophisticated mines were used by state-like actors, but stopped short of blaming Iran or any other state as the culprit. The US national security adviser, John Bolton, said Iran was almost certainly involved. An alternative explanation is that the attacks were undertaken by Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led efforts to oust them from Yemen.Iran has repeatedly said it had no knowledge of the attacks and had not instructed any surrogate forces to attack Gulf shipping or Saudi oil installations.Senior regional officials aligned to Iran and claiming knowledge of Khamenei’s approach to the standoff say he is adamantly opposed to discussions with Washington, or a proxy, from a perceived position of weakness. The officials say Khamenei assesses that Trump likely does not want to initiate a war, but rather renegotiate the nuclear deal that his administration tore up last year.Khamanei and other Iranian leaders are understood to be wanting to enter any negotiation on their own terms, and see global energy security as a key point of leverage in Washington and Riyadh.In a sign of how the Yemen civil war and the wider US-Iranian tensions are becoming intertwined, Riyadh accused Tehran of ordering a Yemeni rebel missile strike that wounded 26 people at a Saudi airport on Wednesday. “The continuation of the Iranian regime’s aggression and reckless escalation, whether directly or through its militias, will result in grave consequences,” Saudi Arabia’s deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, said.Iran and the Yemeni rebels both follow branches of Shia Islam but Tehran has always denied providing more than moral support to the rebels.The rebels say missile and drone strikes against Saudi Arabia are one of the few ways they can retaliate after more than four years of bombing by the Saudi-led coalition, which has exacted a heavy civilian death toll in Yemen."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3924439.1560418877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory leadership candidates the opium user the buffoon and the swivel eyed loon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA combination of file pictures  shows the 10 declared contenders in the Conservative Party leadership contest.

Photograph: STFAFPGetty ImagesNext door in Britain there’s a fevered contest under way for leadership of the Tory Party and thus Britain. The right-wing Tory Party once presented itself as the pragmatic party of business. Now it’s a radical separatist sect populated by clownish demagogues.Whoever wins this contest has to appeal to the 120,000 older little Englanders with Tory party membership who wistfully recall the days of village fetes and bowling on the green and tea with vicar and asbestos in the walls and child labour in the chimneys and unrest in the colonies and the gold standard and TB.And here are the 10 people who promised to make them happy. Thursday’s vote saw three of them eliminated.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEnvironment Secretary Michael GoveWatch him hereA haunted-ventriloquist’s dummy who betrayed and renounced Boris Johnson in the last leadership contest, Gove is here to remind us how wonderful Brexit will be with his treacherous wooden hand on the tiller. He was a journalist once, which means, of course, that he is very talented.In his campaign video, cameras zoom around his pouting Pob-like lips as he speaks slowly about wanting everyone to be “author of their life story” although, typical Tory, he doesn’t go into details on the royalty split.There are also pictures of Britain to remind us where he lives, and pictures of Jeremy Corbyn to remind Tories of what they fear, and some footage of a man holding his little son’s hand to remind us that that though Gove is not of our flesh he understands human emotions and aspires to be one of us. Well, at least until Geppetto tracks him down and drags him back to his workshop. If I was on his campaign team I’d try the slogan “a velvet Gove cast in iron.”A serial leadership candidate and one of the Leave-campaign generals who fronted the Brexit attack on the nation’s economy, Leadsom has in the past said that Brexit sceptics are unpatriotic, has exaggerated her financial industry background and has claimed that those without children have no stake in the future.The latter breaks down as an argument when you look at all the parents who are doing their best to turn their children’s futures into dystopian hellscapes. Ah, feck it I’m a newspaper journalist and I need to be even-handed. One woman’s dystopian hellscape is another’s free-trade Utopia, after all.Rory Stewart is an elderly child and former opium user and the breakout star of this election cycle. He recently posted a video on Twitter in which, despite it clearly being on a tripod, he pretended to be holding his camera selfie-style.But seriously, what do people expect from him, a working knowledge of social media mores? His illicit substance of choice was OPIUM, for God’s sake. That’s the pharmacological equivalent of the Imperial System or cucumber sandwiches with the Queen.Any true Conservative should be encouraging their children to smoke opium. Indeed, in normal times Stewart would be the sort of reasonable compromising conservative who wins contests like this. However, as you’ll know from the scythe-wielding horsemen that rode by your window these are not normal times.Former Foreign Secretary Boris JohnsonWatch him hereWith Michael Gove admitted to having taken cocaine in the 1990s and Rory Stewart admitted to having taken opium in his youth, it probably took all of Boris’s willpower not to yell, “And I’m off my head on ketamine right now!”He truly is an attention-seeking buffoon, the type of hesitating, self-deprecating Englishman who charms Americans and populates Richard Curtis films and who will not hesitate to burn the country down if his hands get cold. His campaign video features him promising tame members of the electorate that he’ll leave the EU on October 31st and saying things like “stop and search” and “wealth creator” while they say things like “lawks, master Johnson you’d make as fine a Prime Minister as Pitt the Elder! Praise good Queen Bess! And bless our boys in the Crimea!”His 1980s-child-star hair cut has been surgically removed and replaced with something more coiffed. But he’s still so unreliable it looks like his own eyes don’t trust his face and are darting around seeking opportunities to escape. You just know that voting for him involves nuclear Armageddon at some point, but sure isn’t that what the Tory rank-and-file want?Matt Hancock doesn’t just like cricket, he loves it and hence his Twitter feed features footage of him playing cricket inside his office. His facility at indoor cricket demonstrates to me more ability than anyone else in the Tory clown car. Unlike some of the others, it’s unclear what his drug of choice is, but going by his following rhetorical question at a recent press conference, it’s probably acid. “If you could choose what time you would be alive? Wouldn’t you choose now?” he asked, and everyone agreed that they would not.Foreign Secretary Jeremy HuntWatch him hereHunt presents himself as a reasonable negotiator, a small business owner, a former Remainer turned pragmatic Leaver, the facilitator of peace talks in Yemen and the London Olympics. Yes, he’s a serious man, not like these flibbertigibbets to his left and right. And yet, I still think the best thing he has done is nearly brain a bystander while ringing a bell.If the Sajid Javid campaign video I just watched is anything to go by he’s a bridge-making Brexiteer who knows how to extricate his nation from the European Union, has a nice family and owns a cute dog. On Twitter he’s going with the hashtag #teamsaj which makes him seem like someone from Love Island but “love” isn’t always the word I’d associate with Javid because I’ve seen him on Question Time. On the other hand, he has a cute dog.The first thing to know about former works and pensions secretary and one-time TV presenter Esther McVey is that Lorraine Kelly hates her. This could be seen in a recent Good Morning Britain interview when, asked if she remembered working with McVey, Kelly replied with a terse “Yeah, yes I do” before changing the subject. Crivens! How has McVey displeased Lorraine Kelly, one of the few pure things left on God’s earth? And what dark times are these, that Kelly’s displeasure does not automatically rule McVey out of the contest?McVey does have some things going for her. She runs a girl-empowerment organisation called If Chloe Can, which provides her with a readymade child army to help push her odd beliefs. She believes, for example, that schoolchildren do not need to know of the existence of gay relationships and that leaving the EU without a deal will be just fine.This sounds like stuff the Tory membership might like. But then you remember that Lorraine Kelly loves each and every one of us, except for Esther McVey. There’s a lot to think about here.All you really know about former chief whip (can any of these people keep a job?) Mark Harper is that he resigned as immigration minister in 2014 when it was discovered his cleaner didn’t have permission to work in the UK. He’s a Remainer-turned-Brexiteer who believes that some extra negotiation period might be required after October 31st. Given his experience as immigration minister, however, there’s a chance he might leave before October 31st by mistake.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic RaabWatch him hereWhen Dominic Raab was Brexit Secretary he apparently realised for the first time that Britain was an island that needed to import stuff through Dover. “But what of the King’s mole machines in distant Australia?” he cried, “And the Zeppelins from the moon?” Then he resigned his position in protest over the draft withdrawal agreement he helped to negotiate.Not content with such swivel-eyed loonery, in his campaign video he swivels his whole body, like the girl in The Exorcist, before speaking in a sedated voice about his love of “fairness.”All the Tories are at this now, shamelessly pretending to care about the common man, when their endgame is actually a deregulated free-trade zone where panda meat is broiled on street by scurvy-inflicted urchins and where safari-ing oligarchs can hunt disobedient Irishmen through the asbestos-lined buildings.Oh, his campaign video also features footage of a cargo ship, to demonstrate that he knows about the existence of cargo ships now.Oh, and his neck is roughly the same width as his head, which makes him look like someone has drawn a face on a thumb.Oh, and if you parse “Dominicraab2019” carefully it reads “Domini Craab 2019” signalling, I think, that Raab is an emissary of the Crab People and that 2019 is the year they will Domin-ate. This is a campaign position as sensible as any others I’ve seen today.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

That immediately could be a huge barrier for men actually coming forward and speaking about it in the first place,” said Prof Niblock.An invisible crisis | Mental health in developing countriesThis stigma was outlined by Andy Bell, Deputy Chief Executive at the Centre for Mental Health who argued that the most effective approaches to mental health issues involve creating a comfortable space for people.Using a case study in Birmingham, he said the support was “based on relationships and building a continuous, consistent relationship with someone rather than seeing endless people, and certainly not going down the route where you have to be diagnosed with an illness and go along to a building marked mental health.”According to the Office for National Statistics, three out of four people who take their own lives are men. This is the biggest cause of death for men under 50 in England and Wales.The Health and Social Care Information Centre says that men are three times more likely than women to become alcohol dependent, which can have devastating effects, as alcohol dependent men are eight times more likely to take their own lives than men who are not alcoholics.While “younger people are much more emotionally literate” according to Ruth Sutherland, CEO of Samaritans, currently, only one in three children who need mental health services are getting the help they require.To solve this, the NHS has proposed a ten-year plan to get fully trained mental health teams into schools to make the services more accessible for young people.Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123Comment: Tory MPs who want to thwart Brexit will now have to accept that the game is upMore poor youngsters must be admitted to Scottish universities even with \u0026#39hard cases\u0026#39 of middle-class pupils missing out, ministers toldOil tankers hit in fresh \u0026#39torpedo attack\u0026#39 in Gulf of Oman amid Iran tensions - live updatesTory leadership vote result: Boris Johnson surges ahead in first round with 114 votes - latest newsComment: Despite Boris Johnson\u0026#39s big win, there is still a path to victory for Jeremy HuntHong Kong protesters attack Britain\u0026#39s response to extradition protests as pressure from Beijing growsDuckweed: why the bane of pond owners is set to become a superfoodCouncil attacked after spending £10m on cycle super highway which is little-used and causing major congestionBoy died of asthma attack after ambulance crew decided he did not need to go to hospital, inquest hears Police officer arrested after vigilante student uses Snapchat gender swap filter to pose as underage girlNature is good for your health - but only if it\u0026#39s two hours or more a week, scientists sayComment: Sorry to burst the \u0026#39Boris-mania\u0026#39 bubble, but even he will struggle to save the Tories nowMission impossible?

Tools like Global Fishing Watch allow Oceana and others to identify suspicious patterns and flag higher risk behaviors for further investigation.”Oceana carried out a test run of the technology on two vessels that were previously involved in confirmed cases of forced labour and IUU fishing and one ship that was suspected of these illegal activities. One South Korean-flagged fishing vessel with a history of law-breaking appeared to repeatedly stop transmitting its AIS. Over an almost five-year period, Oceana detected 73 apparent gaps immediately outside of Argentina’s national waters.One gap lasted almost 12 days and ended when the Argentine Coast Guard captured the vessel for fishing illegally. Migrants allege abuse at hands of EU-funded forcesAnother Taiwanese-flagged vessel, on which an alleged human trafficking victim was reported to have perished in 2011, remained at sea for up to 20 months between 2015 and 2017.In a third case study, a refrigerated cargo vessel, previously identified by Indonesia for its association with human trafficking, conducted an illegal transshipment off the coast of Somalia in 2017 before moving from port to port to try to avoid sanctions and unload its catch. The ship was ultimately prevented from landing its catch by authorities in the regional ports. The mapping platform, which uses machine-learning algorithms to interpret and distill large datasets was the “first of its kind,” Lacey Malarky, the report’s author told the . “The beauty of Global Fishing Watch is that it is free for anyone to use so it empowers governments, researchers, journalists,” she said. “AIS is a public broadcast message so this is probably one of the most cost-effective ways for a country to see what is happening in its waters, especially developing countries that have limited resources,” Ms Malarky added. “It’s a game-changer for a lot of countries that have been struggling with monitoring and enforcement.”The Oceana report also calls for a ban on transshipment at sea, the mandatory use of tamper-resistant AIS devices and an international list of vessels with track records of human rights abuses.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Human species are not believed to inhabited this region until much later.Created with Sketch.New species of ancient human discovered - in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandA foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandIt is not clear if the wolf, which is estimated to have been between two and four years old when it died, would have been larger or smaller than contemporary wolf species, though scientists said it had stronger jaws which enabled it to kill bigger animals, including bison.The 40-centimetre head was put on public display at a woolly mammoth exhibition in Tokyo last week.Dr Albert Protopopov, head of mammoth fauna studies at the Yakutia academy of sciences told the Siberian Times: “This is a unique discovery of the first ever remains of a fully grown Pleistocene wolf with its tissue preserved. We will be comparing it to modern-day wolves to understand how the species has evolved and to reconstruct its appearance.”Addressing those who suggested the head resembled that of a bear, Dr Protopopov said: “It is definitely a wolf.

Human species are not believed to inhabited this region until much later.Created with Sketch.New species of ancient human discovered - in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandA foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandIt is not clear if the wolf, which is estimated to have been between two and four years old when it died, would have been larger or smaller than contemporary wolf species, though scientists said it had stronger jaws which enabled it to kill bigger animals, including bison.The 40-centimetre head was put on public display at a woolly mammoth exhibition in Tokyo last week.Dr Albert Protopopov, head of mammoth fauna studies at the Yakutia academy of sciences told the Siberian Times: “This is a unique discovery of the first ever remains of a fully grown Pleistocene wolf with its tissue preserved. We will be comparing it to modern-day wolves to understand how the species has evolved and to reconstruct its appearance.”Addressing those who suggested the head resembled that of a bear, Dr Protopopov said: “It is definitely a wolf.

The leadership contenders’ initiatives are little more than wishful thinking.Above all, the expensive promises are just a gigantic distraction from the real task ahead: the delivery of Brexit. That is what really matters. Everything  is an irrelevance.The Tories’ entire future depends on the achievement of British independence. If that goal is reached, there is a chance of recovery, especially against the ided, ineptly-led Labour party.Butthe Tories fail to implement Brexit, they will be annihilated at the next General Election, a truth reinforced by the Peterborough by-election last week, when the Tories, in territory they have traditionally held since , were squeezed into a distant third place by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.Yet the leadership candidates continue dishing out their frivolous commitments like confetti. Here are just some of the ill-conceived promises made on the campaign trail so far...Cocaine enthusiast Michael Gove says he will abolish VAT and replace it with a sales tax.The move could be ruinously expensive for the Government, for VAT brings in almost £ billion-a-year. Most other countries in the world have a form of VAT.As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies puts it, Gove’s proposal would be “the biggest, riskiest, and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century.”The front runner Boris Johnson caused enormous controversy – and damage to himself – with his plan to cut tax for high earners by raising the  per cent threshold from £,-a-year to £,-a-year.His scheme would not only be cripplingly expensive to the Treasury, costing at least £. billion-a-year, but also is unlikely to win over less well-off voters, who should be the Tories’ prime target.According to one study yesterday, fewer than one in ten workers in the West Midlands would be winners.It might be noted, however, that MPs would be big gainers, for their £, salary is just below Boris’s proposed new threshold.Usually clear and rational, even Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been infected with the madness of the leadership contest.Is he seriously suggesting we might go to war with either of them, despite all the lessons of our failed military interventions over the last two decades.And every one per cent increase in the proportion of national income spent on defence will cost the taxpayer at least £ billion.Esther McVey likes to pose as a tough northerner, but she is a soppy left-winger when it comes to schools.Sounding like a typical Labour MP, she bleated last week about “severe under-funding in schools” and said that “it’s time we started listening to the teaching unions,” as she promised an extra £ billion-a-year.But the unions are they last people we should listen to on education.Addicted to serial whingeing, they have opposed every single sensible reform over recent years, while they have invented the so-called funding crisis for their own political ends.Joining in the prodigality, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged both an extra £. billion for the social care system and a new insurance scheme to end the supposed “injustice” of homes sold to meet care costs.But is this really a scandal  Why should ordinary taxpayers have to fork out to protect the inheritances of the affluent Home Secretary Sajid Javid promises a whopping £ million to Ireland as a “grand gesture” to solve the Brexit border problem, for which he has also advocated the use of new technology.But his proposal is both expensive and unworkable. As one Government official points out, “No Government worldwide currently controls dferent customs arrangements with no physical infrastructure at the border.”Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who sees himself as a Thatcherite, calls for slashing tax cuts for the low-paid, by raising the threshold at which employee national insurance contributions start from £ to £,, an average saving of £-a-year.He also proposes a penny off income tax for everyone, part of his drive ultimately to lower the basic rate from p to p. But such steps would signicantly shrink the tax base, as well as cost the Government as much as £ billion-a-year.Given that these candidates aspire to run the country, the leadership contest has been a depressing spectacle so far. Its excesses reflect the Tory party’s flight from serious statesmanship.Matt Hancock describes the contest as a “great festival of ideas.”It is more like a carnival of amateur illusionists desperately hoping their tired tricks will distract us from the Tories failure to deliver Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sooner or later that debt is paid.”It’s open to debate whether the disaster, as Mikhail Gorbachev’s  quote in the credits suggested, led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.What’s undeniable is that Chernobyl is one of the greatest TV dramas of the century.The beautul and touching tribute  Up paid to Lynn Johnson. Over-caffeinated tubbalump Piers Morgan once again turning Good Morning  Britain’s week into a captivating and unmissable mix of news, sport, presidential interviews, free- wheeling abuse and fantastically rude suggestions about Susanna Reid’s love le.And Harry Hill breaking off an insanely funny episode of Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by TalkSport genius Paul Hawksbee, to wonder: “Could I just live off the money from You’ve Been Framed ”Yes, but please don’t.RANDOM TV irritations: Killing Eve II posting a good mid-term shout for the most over-rated and unpleasant show of .The Sky Atlantic continuity pox who talked all over the closing credits of Chernobyl.ITV’s Clive Tyldesley sounding more like a fan than a commentator at the Euro Nations.And Love Island’s Iain Stirling “sending solidarity to the Donald Trump blimp protesters”, at the end of Good Morning Britain, like he was Lech Walesa addressing Gdansk shipyard workers, rather than the ITV dating show bloke doing the warm-up slot for Lorraine Kelly.THE week’s most eye-catching documentary began with a production assistant vox-popping some chimpanzee sex videos and a startled shopper exclaiming:  “Oh wow.“You’re really showing this on Channel  ”What  You thought better of the network behind Naked  Attraction Of course they’re showing My Gay Dog  And Other Animals, a right-on farce which attempted to prove the impossible via a mutt called Norman, whose rear end received not a moment’s peace from a humping little nuisance called Franco, an Italian Greyhound, who really should’ve been called Bruno or Tonioli.There were also “gay” lions and sheep, “bisexual” binobos and some field study input from Professor Paul Vasey, who’s been observing “lesbian” macaques for  years but, like all academics, still has more questions than answers: “Are they doing this to commun- icate about dominance “Are they doing this to form alliances “Are they doing this to reconcile conflict ”Or are they just doing this ’cos they  can’t get Wentworth on Netflix You tell me, weirdo.After a solid hour of virtue-signalling and speculation, though,  it was left to the narrator to tell us what any  three-year-old could’ve explained  minutes ago.“We can’t confirm Franco’s sexuality   per cent, however . . .”BZZZZZ.

In fact, they have all been produced and distributed by the BBC’s rivals.This week there was uproar after the BBC announced that over-s will now lose the right to their free TV licence, saving around £m per year.And we all know where theyll be splashing this cash - chasing the elusive youth market whove turned away from the BBC in their droves in favour of online streaming services like Netflix, Now TV, and Amazon Prime Video.But as a -year-old who ditched their licence fee last year - instead Im a fully paid-up member of Generation Netflix - I can tell them theyre going about it all wrong.For young people like me, it’s clear that the BBC is stuck in the past. In fact, it’s so out-of-touch that it still offers a discount for anyone whose TV only works in black and white.It’s easy to see how the Beeb’s snooty tone and we-know-best attitude earned it the nickname ‘Auntie’. Today it is more patronising than ever.Lets look at the youth-oriented BBC Three.In an attempt to appeal to young audiences, the channel focuses on niche, politically-correct content, with the latest hits including a show about a niqab-wearing parachutistand an article praising “eco warriors”.The crusty old relic BBC is trying to appear cool and relevant to the youth - but it has been duped into thinking that loud, hysterical snowflakes are representative of an entire generation.It’s clear that the BBC thinks all young people are Jeremy Corbyn-loving lefties so has skewed its content to be hyper left-wing and social justice-oriented to reflect that, when in reality we have erse opinions. Whisper it, but some of us are even right-wing.And BBC Three’s toe-curling Twitter account is a prime example of how not to communicate with young people.The account has done away with grammar entirely, and whoever runs it communicates almost exclusively in gs. Presumably, they think that’s how we all talk, but it’s not cool or edgy… it’s just awkward.Another part of the BBC’s problem is that younger people just don’t consume news and TV the same way as our parents and grandparents.While older people may be happy to wait for the news headlines on TV, we prefer to get our information on demand, via online news sites.Social media outstrips TV as the main news source for young people, with  per cent of - year olds getting their headline fix that way.These websites are less dry than the stale BBC coverage, and at least with other publications you know up-front what their biases are – they don’t pretend to be impartial while peddling a lefty editorial line like the BBC.Just look at todays BBC news headlines for examples of how dull the news can be.Less-than-riveting articles on the site include “How to cope with email overload”, alongside a piece about whether your dining room table was made from illegally-sourced wood and what your bedroom says about you. It’s not exactly gripping, public-interest journalism.In trying to be everything to everyone, the BBC is failing to satisfy anyone - certainly not young people.And it’s not just their online output which shows it up. Just compare what the rest of the BBC is showing to what’s on offer by its rivals.Netflix is currently airing new episodes of the excellent sci-fi series Black Mirror, while Sky Go viewers are going mad for nuclear disaster drama, Chernobyl.Meanwhile, the top shows on BBC iPlayer at the moment include dramas like Casualty and repeats of ancient comedies like Blackadder.And on TV tonight, while ITV has us swooning at Love Island, the BBC will be airing Holby City, Springwatch and… more repeats – this time of Live At The Apollo. Yawn.While these shows may be popular with older audiences, it’s clear that there just isn’t much there for young people.When you can stream a library of millions of shows on a laptop or tablet, it feels a bit backwards to sit down and subject yourself to a TV schedule which someone  has decided for you.Of course, it would be unfair to say that the BBC doesn’t do anything right. Fleabag, Killing Eve and Bodyguard have all proved to be very popular.But the question is: why do we all have to pay for these shows evenwe have no intention of watching them While BBC viewers are forced by law to fork out £. per year for the privilege of owning a TV, Netflix customers can pay as little as £. per year to access an ever-growing library of top-tier tele.Amazon Prime Video is similarly priced at £ per year, while Now TV will set you back £.. Sky is more expensive, but you can still find packages for £ per month.It’s no wonder that Brits are turning away from the Beeb, with nearly a million of us cancelling our licence fees every year in favour of cheaper alternatives.Surely a subscription model, like Amazon Prime or Netflix, would be a fairer way to pay for BBC TV.By scrapping the licence fee for everyone, we could force the BBC – supposedly a public service broadcaster – to actually serve the public.Until then, I’ll stick to Netflix.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many branded the concept of a licence fee as “outdated” in a world of digital streaming.

The other two cameras didn’t pick it up for some reason.But self-declared experts have said they are certain the footage had not been doctored with computer trickery.And some web sleuths claimed they had the answer to the mystery.They claimed the creature was most likely a skinny child wearing flip-flops and pants on their head.In an interview with Inside Edition, Gomez admitted her son, Bobby, likes to joke around and loves to dance.When asked whether the creature could be her son, Gomez replied: No ... I wouldnt let him out at dark by himself.She also said none of the neighbourhood children looked anything like the creature.Whatever the explanation, many Potter fans were eager to celebrate a possibleof Dobby, as the beloved character tragically died in the sixth film Deathly Hallows.Maury Wills wrote on Facebook: “Dobby came to make sure you are safe!”One Twitter user then added: “Everyone’s joking that this is Dobby but I’m here deciding not to go outside at night ever again.”Eagle-eyed Twitter users pointed out that at one stage in the video there appears to be two shadows which suggests someone could be operating an elf-like puppet.Another explanation offered was that the weird figure was superimposed onto the footage using some clever camera trickery.Reactions to Dobbys death were so emotional that writer JK Rowling was moved to apologise on Twitter in  for killing off the free elf.This year, I apologise for killing someone who didnt die during the #BattleofHogwarts, but who laid down his le to save the people whod win it.

water flowing again.This evening it opened an emergency bottled water station in Hampton after thousands of homes were left with little or no water.The move came after panic buyers emptied shops of tens of thousands of bottles of water - some were seen loading dozens into supermarket trolleys.Pictures were posted on social media showing shelves stripped bare of drinking water as people were left without supplies for hours. Many worried customers have also been tweeting to ask when emergency supplies would be issued by the authorities.Others were quick to askthey would be receiving any compensation as a result of the water supply outage.One Twitter user, who was recovering from surgery, askedanyone knew when bottled water was being distributed, adding she cant carry heavy things and my local is out of bottled.Kerry Watts also wrote: Five hours without water - surely its time to get some bottles out to the most needy Residents in Whitton, Teddington and Isleworth have also been affected and Ealing Council revealed that some residents in the borough were also without water.Parts of Ealing, Hounslow, Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith and Fulham have also been affected by the pipe

Hell, it won’t be much to give up, will it Not only that, but soon — presumably — the Beeb will be hauling -year-olds into court because they haven’t coughed up their fee.That’ll be good publicity, won’t it  And it will convince even more people that not paying the licence should be decriminalised. As it should.The BBC is insisting that this was a “tough decision to take”. And thatthey didn’t do it, they’d have to close some channels down.Really  How about sacking Gary Lineker  Does he really deserve almost million quid a year for whining about Brexit and telling you what’s coming next on Match Of The Day There are plenty more big-star salaries that could be sacriced, too.But how about getting rid of the vast swathe of middle managers in the BBC When I was a journo there I had to answer to about  bosses, most of who were inept and who usually disagreed with each other. More bosses than you could shake a stick at.There’s , people working for the BBC. If you got rid of a few thousand middle managers the output would improve and they’d have easily saved their money.Director-Generals always say they’re going to cut down on the middle managers. They never do.Director-Generals also say they’re going to spend less on consultants. Lord Hall promised precisely this. But last year they INCREASED that spending to £.million.Or how about they close down the BBC’s online service, which competes against commercial organisations and is utterly unnecessary This is the problem — well, one problem — with the Beeb. It over-reaches. It’s meant to make nice radio and TV programmes we might all enjoy. But that’s long forgotten.It now tries to do everything. And it tramples on commercial organisations which don’t have a yearly licence fee to support their grandiose schemes.Have a look at the web page for BBC jobs. They’re asking for architects, data scientists and resource schedulers.I haven’t a clue what a resource scheduler is, but I bet the BBC could get by without one. And architects This is all a real own goal by the BBC. More and more people are sick to the back teeth of its relentless political bias, its political correctness and the lack of decent stuff you might want to watch or hear.Truth is, it shouldn’t be just the pensioners who should be excused paying the licence fee.It is time it was removed from the rest of us as well.It’s long outlived its usefulness.SO, Boris has unveiled his leadership bid.Lower taxes and a definite exit from the European Union by October .I’ve always had my doubts about Boris as a Prime Minister.

Candidates for Tory leader are lining up to back a hard exit in a pitch to the partyaposs , voting members. Some are fighting against crashing out of the EU without a deal - with Jeremy Hunt branding the plan suicide. But just one was fighting to stop Brexit altogether through a second referendum, Sam Gyimah, and he dropped out before even passing the first hurdle. Whoever wins the Tory leadership contest will be in  Downing Street by the end of July, and try to put their strategy in place over the summer.  That means they will have a massive impact on how we leave the EU on October , or whether we do at all. The EU could offer an extension beyond Halloween , or Parliamentary gridlock could force a general election. Britainaposs electoral system means we vote for MPs, not a PM - who whoeveraposs in power can steer Brexit without an election by you, the public. Instead the nationaposs policy looks set to be decided by the , Tories who vote in the leadership contest. So what are the candidatesapos positions on Brexit  And how likely are they to crash us out without a deal  Weaposve profiled their positions below - carefully finding comments theyaposve made since coming out for leadership. You can also read our profiles of all the candidates, the full timetable for the race and their policies on everything  apart from Brexit.  All the candidates - ranked from most to least Brexity Dominic Raab HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The former Brexit Secretary backs leaving without a deal on October  -thataposs what it takes. He has said Britain should be getting a fairer deal and he would prefer to leave with a renegotiated deal. But he added the UK must calmly demonstrate unflinching resolve to leave in October - at the latest. Critics fear his hardline views will make him more likely to walk out of negotiations with the EU. That would plunge the UK into no-deal in October, or could force a general electionMPs revolt against the government. Mr Raab walked out of the Cabinet in November in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal and has said itaposs time for a new direction. Boris Johnson HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The frontrunner declared heaposs prepared to crash out of the EU with no deal on October . We will leave the EU on October , deal or no deal, Mr Johnson said in May . To get things done you need to be prepared to walk away. But behind the scenes heaposs been less hardline, telling moderate MPs his preference is still a negotiated exit. One insider in his camp told the Mirror: He knows that no deal would be damaging. Butyou want to renegotiate youaposve got to keep it on the table. The problem for moderate Tory MPs, members and the public is this - which Boris Johnson should they believe  Leadership rival Rory Stewart compared him to liar Pinocchio, saying Borisapos no deal promise went back on pledges he made in private. And heaposs famously chosen his views opportunistically, coming out for Leave in  at the moment of maximum impact despite writing an article for each side. He did however burnish his Brexiteer credentials by quitting Cabinet in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal. Most recently he has said he would use £ billion orce bill to secure a better deal, refusing to hand over the cash unless improved terms were on offer. That enraged EU chiefs who suggested such a move would be illegal. Sajid Javid HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The Home Secretary has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit adding: Itaposs time to rebuild trust, find unity and create new opportunities across the UK. The -year-old backed Remain in the referendum and has since positioned himself as a firm Leaver. He said the policy of a Javid administration would be to leave the EU on October  andI have to choose between no deal and no Brexit, I would pick no deal. Instead the Home Secretary said: Iaposm clear that my plan would be to leave on October . I want to leave with a deal butI have to choose between no-deal and no Brexit I would pick no deal. He said his plan is to push through a new Brexit deal that hinges on coming up with an alternative to the Irish border aposbackstopapos, saying: [Ireland] is the tail that wags the dog on this. He has pledged to offer to spend hundreds of millions on a technological solution to the Irish border question. Michael Gove HARD BREXIT RATING:    Reports suggest he is ready to delay Brexit for another year, until late , to avoid crashing out without a deal. He said there must be a proper and informed debate about the options Britain faces despite claiming we would be able to get through a no deal departure. He has confirmed that he would be prepared to delay Brexit beyond the October  deadline for days or weeks -a deal was within reach. The Leave-voting Environment Secretary was a Theresa May loyalist and urged MPs to pass her deal. Now Mr Gove is posing as a self-styled unity candidate to unite the Conservative Party, deliver Brexit and lead this great country. Meanwhile he has offered to introduce free UK citizenship for more than million EU citizens living here who would,they stay, eventually become eligible. That would waive the current £, naturalisation fee - though Commonwealth citizens in the UK would still have to pay. Like Jeremy Hunt he has suggested he believes the EU could reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, commenting: changing the prime minister changes everything. He said: We would have a full stop to the backstop, we would also have a clear approach to making sure that we have a Canada-style free trade agreement. Matt Hancock HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The Remain-voting Health Secretary said itaposs mission critical to deliver Brexit before a general election. But the next election is only due in . And heaposs refused to rule out another extension to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal on October . Heaposs said he would re-enter negotiations with the EU with a five-point plan to leave with a deal. The Health Secretary said he would immediately guarantee EU citizensapos rights, rewrite the political declaration in the Brexit deal, create an aposIrish border councilapos, seek a time limit to the border backstop , and hand £bn to border communities. He said No Deal Brexit is not a policy choice available to the next prime minister because of the deadlock in Parliament.  Mr Hancock - who chartered planes and fridges to store medicines in a no-deal - said he would have to level with people about the trade-offs. He added: I think it is much, much easier to bring people together behind a proposalyou are straightforward in advance. Jeremy Hunt HARD BREXIT RATING:    The Foreign Secretary has said pushing for No Deal Brexit would be political suicide and could make the Conservatives extinct. He added MPs could force a general election against any Prime Minister who tried - putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street by Christmas. Yet days later he said he would accept a No Deal - as a last resort and with a heavy heart. The comments are the latest stage in a long run flip-flopping opinions from Mr Hunt. He voted Remain in  but later tried to appeal to Tory Brexiteers, comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and branding himself a born-again Brexiteer and insisting no deal is better than no Brexit. In reality though, few believe he will choose a course he himself has said we would regret for generations. Instead he claims the solution is to change the Withdrawal Agreement Theresa May agreed with the EU in a new round of talks. He claimed Angela Merkel told him the EU would be willing to negotiate on the Brexit deal with a new prime minister when he she was in the UK to mark the D-Day anniversary. Mr Hunt claimed the German Chancellor told him Brussels would look at any solutions the UK puts forward to solve the Northern Irish border issue. He has said he is confident of getting a deal. Thataposs despite the fact the EU has repeatedly said it will not reopen the -page Withdrawal Agreement, which was finished in November  and has been blocked by MPs ever since. Mr Hunt also claimed he wanted Brexiteers including the DUP and Tory hardliners to join the negotiating team. But he refused to say he would involve Nigel Farage, whose Brexit Party won a landslide in the EU elections, or Jeremy Corbyn who he accused of bad faith. Rory Stewart HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The International Development Secretary is the biggest Remainer on the ticket - and has said heaposd refuse to work under a Boris Johnson government. He said No Deal will be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and dishonest that would destroy  years of reputation overnight. And he compared Boris Johnson to Pinocchio and Brexiteersapos thinking to the Wizard of Oz. Mr Stewart has met Unite chief Len McCluskey and plans citizensapos assemblies to find consensus over Brexit. He saidnecessary he would even work with Nigel Farage, adding: The whole point about this is: no red lines, talk to everyone. Eliminated candidates Esther McVey HARD BREXIT RATING:    The Tory MP for Tatton was arguably the hardest Brexiteer on the ticket and says we should get ready to leave the EU with no deal. She demanded Brexit happens deal or no deal on October , no matter how damaging for business - something she called a clean Brexit. She said the next leader of the Tories has to be a Brexiteer as the failure to deliver Brexit has left many in the party demoralised. And she refused to rule out a pact with Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, telling the : Nigel Farage is a tour de force. He has changed the narrative. He has caught the mood of the moment. Ms McVey quit as Work and Pensions Secretary in protest at Theresa Mayaposs Brexit plans. She has said she would prorogue Parliament to leave the EU without a dealshe became Prime Minister accusing MPs trying to prevent Brexit of tearing up  years of history. Ms McVey said it would not be her priority to suspend sittings in the House of Commons in the run-up to the October  deadline, but said she would be willing to use all the tools at our disposalshe won. Andrea Leadsom  HARD BREXIT RATING:    The former Cabinet minister declared she would lead Britain out the EU with or without a deal in October. Leaving the EU on October  is for me a hard, red line, she said. She previously described the UKaposs continued membership of the EU as disgusting and claimed that a Brexiteer PM would have delivered Brexit already. And she was the final Cabinet resignation in a chain that fuelled Theresa Mayaposs eventual decision to quit. She unveiled a three-step plan which made clear she is rolling up her sleeves to leave without a deal on October . The former Commons Leader would introduce immediate laws to protect EU citizensapos rights, ramp up No Deal preparations, and then hold a UK-EU summit in Belfast to in September to agree temporary trading terms to manage the impact of our exit. Mark Harper HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The Forest of Dean MP declared it just isnapost possible to leave the EU by October  and a delay will be needed. He said: One thing Iaposm not promising, as much as Iaposd like, is that we will leave deal or no-deal come October . Why  Itaposs because Iaposm being straight with you and it just isnapost possible. As a chief whip who has had to operate when the numbers were tight, I know how Parliament works and I know how to count.

The former Work and Pensions Secretary said she was undecided who to throw her support behind after she crashed out of the race. Ms McVey is reviled by many for her reputation as a welfare slasher at the department for work and pensions. But she had hoped her support for Brexit , her support for cuts to foreign aid and her championing of blue collar conservatism would appeal to her fellow Tories. Earlier this week Ms McVey had an awkward run in with her former colleague Lorraine when she appeared on Good Morning Britain, with the Scottish star awkwardly dodging questions about their time working together.    And the former cabinet minister was widely criticised after backing parents who want to take their children out of LBGBT education. Ms McVey said she believed parents should be able to take their children out of such lessons. She said: Iaposm being very clear: the final say is with the parents andparents want to take their young children - thataposs primary school children - out of  certain forms of sex education, relationship education, then that is down to them. Ms McVey became embroiled in a pubic spat after Lorraine Kelly, , appeared to snub the Tory leadership hopeful in a cringe TV segment this week. She later said Kelly’s cold reaction to her stemmed from their GMTV days when she was “promoted to be partnering with Eamonn Holmes” above the Scottish star. But her recollection of events was disputed by fellow GMTV star Fiona Phillips, who insisted McVeyaposs story didnapost add up. As Tory MPs cast their votes Ms McVey had hung around in a desperate last-minute bid for support. But she made a quiet getaway before voting even closed at noon - and declined to say whether she thought she’d got through. She told the Mirror the important thing was the  she stood on - raiding billions from foreign aid to boost schools and police. The hard Brexiteer also declined to say who she might back now. In a statement Esther McVey said she would speak to the remaining candidates before deciding who to give her support. She said: “I am extremely grateful to those people who voted for me in this election and to the fantastic team who have supported my campaign.  “I am pleased to have had a  to make the case for Blue Collar Conservatism, a clean break from the EU and the need to invest money into schools, policing and a proper pay rise for our public sector workers. “I will speak to the remaining candidates to see who is best placed to deliver on that programme. “I wish the remaining candidates well and I hope that all Conservative MPs will unite behind whoever wins this contest which is essential to prevent the disaster of a Marxist Government. “Whoever becomes the new leader will certainly receive my support.” Tory chiefs revealed the results of the first round of voting with Boris Johnson a clear frontrunner with  votes - more than double his nearest rival Jeremy Hunt. Any candidate who did not win  fellow MPsapos support was knocked today thanks to a tightening of the rules. Andrea Leadsom and Mark Harper were also booted out after earning just  and  votes respectively. But   anti-hard-Brexit outsider, the Old Etonian oddball Rory Stewart, scraped through to the next round with  MPs behind him. It leaves seven all-male candidates to be Prime Minister ahead of more MPsapos knockout rounds next week - and a vote on the final two by , Tory members. It also ramps up the competition between Jeremy Huntand cocaine-scandal-hit Michael Govein the race to be the not Boris candidate.

Sajid Javid said I want to see justice done as he cleared a key hurdle standing between the Wikileaks founder and possible decades in jail. The announcement is likely to be seen as a final show of strength by the Tory leadership contender as MPs voted on the next Prime Minister today. Mr Javid has repeatedly rejected Labouraposs pleas to block the extradition of the -year-old after he was dragged out of a ,-day stay in the Ecuadorean embassy. Assange will face his latest legal hearing tomorrow and while the final decision is for the courts, Mr Javid said he would not stand in the way of extradition.    He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Thereaposs an extradition request from the US which is before the courts tomorrow. Yesterday I signed the extradition order and certied it and that will be going in front of the curts tomorrow. Itaposs a decision ultimately for the courts but there is a very important part of it for the Home Secretary. And I want to see justice done at all times. Weaposve got a legitimate extradition request so Iaposve signed it, but the final decision is now with the courts. Assange was charged last month in the United States with receiving and publishing thousands of classied documents linked to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US Justice Department has indicted the -year-old, who is currently jailed in Britain, on  new counts that relate to his alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classied information in the history of the United States, it said. He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Cha Manning in unlawfully obtaining and disclosing classied documents related to the national defence, a statement said. The Justice Department said that by publishing unredacted versions of the leaked files, Assange put named human sources at a grave and imminent risk. After a federal grand jury ed the indictment on Thursday, WikiLeaks swtly issued a tweet describing the move as madness. It is the end of national security journalism and the first amendment, it said. Assangeaposs lawyer told the Mirror he was suffering osteoperosis and dental problems after being dragged, grey-haired and pony-tailed, by officers invited into the embassy. Assange was accused of rape by a woman he met at a conference in Sweden in August . He denied the claims but has never been tried in court over them due to his refusal to face justice. In June , Swedish prosecutors called for him to be extradited to the Sweden. But his lawyers claimed this could be a pretext to extradite him to the US, where Wikileaks’ revelations exposed military wrongdoing and humiliated the establishment. So Assange fled bail and applied for asylum in Ecuador, walking into the countryaposs embassy in London where he stayed for almost seven years.

Cha said: “I was being violently sick so my mum called the GP to make an emergency appointment, which I got straight away as the receptionist could hear my screams. “The doctor knew something was very wrong as he only had to lightly touch the back of my head and I screamed in pain.”\u2028    Cha was sent straight to her local hospital for a CT scan, which revealed a cm mass on her brain.\u2028 She was later admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.\u2028 The bride-to-be said: I was so scared – I convinced myself it was cancer and I was going to die.  “My parents were terried, too.”\u2028 Two days later, she underwent a seven-hour operation when  per cent of the orange-sized tumour was removed.\u2028 Biopsy tests revealed it was a low gradepilocytic astrocytoma.\u2028 Cha said: “I was told I was two weeks away from paralysis from the waist down as the tumour was pressing on my spinal cord.  She had to have six months off work. and says getting over surgery was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  “I had to learn to walk again, to spell and even to cut up my food.  “My parents were such a support and I’d never have accomplished all that without them.”\u2028 Love was the last thing on her mind and because of everything she had been through, Cha feared she would never meet someone who could accept her as she was.  That changed in an instant when she had her first date with Michael, also , in January , after meeting him on an online dating app.\u2028 She said: I had no confidence and was convinced no one would be interested in me as soon as I told them I had a brain tumour. “Why would anyone take the risk of getting involved with me in case I got ill again  I was also terribly self-conscious about my scars.\u2028 “I was convinced I was never going to have anyone in my le or experience getting married and having children.”\u2028 But auditor Michael dispelled that fear when Cha decided to be upfront with him right from the start.\u2028 She said: “We’d been chatting online and a week before our first date, I told him I had a brain tumour. “I wanted to be honest straight away and give him a chance to back off.\u2028 “He wasn’t fazed at all and told me a brain tumour was only part of me and that it didn’t define me.”\u2028  On their first date, Cha and Michael went for a meal and then to the cinema.\u2028 She said: “I just knew immediately we were going to be serious.\u2028 “And I loved the first question he asked me, ‘If you could choose anywhere in the world to go, where would it be ’\u2028“I replied, ‘Iceland to see the Northern Lights.’\u2028 “It felt like I’d always known Michael and I trusted him implicitly straight away.\u2028 That was it, we were a couple.”\u2028Within three months, Cha, who has now also become a Young Ambassador with The Brain Tumour Charity moved into his parents’ house before they moved out to rent their own place in July .\u2028She said: “We threw ourselves in at the deep end and have been blissfully happy ever since. “Michael is so kind and supportive. “He comes to appointments with me and looks after me when I’m feeling ill.”\u2028 And he has boosted Cha’s confidence.\u2028 She said: “Michael immediately accepted me for me.\u2028 “He tells I’m beautul every day and I tell him not to be a softie!”\u2028 Cha, an administrator for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors , now has scans every two years.

George Jackson, , had arranged to meet a girl who he believed was  for aposnon penetrative sexual activityapos, Newcastle Crown Court heard. The entertainer and former professional wrestler - who went by the name The Outlaw - was caught by paedophile hunter group Dark Justice after making contact with an online profile. Pensioner Jackson had attempted to wow judges with his singing on Britainaposs Got Talent in , Chronicle Live reports.  Jackson, who claimed he was the victim of the group, admitted attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and was given a community order.    At the sentencing hearing, his barrister askedthe sexual harm prevention order he was given could be relaxed to allow him to entertain children, but that was rejected. The court heard Jackson had posed as a man twenty years younger than his actual age when communicating with the decoy profile at the beginning of January. Alive to the possibility the profile may not be genuine, he asked whether Jessie could be trusted and was told by the decoy: Iaposm not a grass, I hate the pigs. Michael Bunch, prosecuting, said: The defendant identied he was at risk of being arrested because of her age.    He suggested they could meet up for non penetrative sexual activity and as a consequence an arrangement was made to meet the following day. Members of Dark Justice travelled to the defendantaposs home area, he having arranged a meeting near a local shop. When he turned up, he was challenged by Dark Justice and police arrived to arrest him. Mr Bunch said: He accepted he had been involved in a conversation but suggested he was as much a victim of them as they were a victim of him, suggesting he was directed towards the responses he had given and therefore denied any culpability in that regard. Defence barrister John Wilkinson askedJacksonaposs sexual harm prevention order could be relaxed to allow him to entertain children.  Mr Wilkinson said: He describes himself as an entertainer, in fact, he is a singer. He has been very keen to let me see a number of hand bills, indicating the sort of matters he would like to do,at all possible. One of those would involve his attendance at childrenaposs parties, singing at childrenaposs parties. Mr Wilkinson said parents would be present at such parties, meaning Jackson would not be with them unsupervised. Judge Robert Adams sentenced Jackson to a community order for two years with mental health treatment and rehabilitation requirements. The judge said Jackson must sign the sex offendersapos register and abide by the sexual harm prevention oder for five years.  Judge Adams made it a condition of the order that he has no contact with children without the permission of parents, who are aware of his conviction, and of social services. The order means Jackson cannot perform at childrenaposs parties. Judge Adams said: I would be failing in my public dutyI did not include that. It seems that is precisely the sort of circumstances the court ought to include in the order. The judge said the condition was necessary for the protection of the public. Mr Wilkinson said Jacksonaposs mental health problems, which include bipolar disorder, had some influence on his offending behaviour and he had been sectioned but hopes to be released from hospital soon.

Now Miss Hall has called on cops to speak to the TV star. The police need to arrest her so others will think twice and realise it isnapost a joking matter, far from it, Miss Hall said. Something so serious needs to be treated seriously.  A lot of people watch her and she is obviously a big influence and for her to joke about something like that takes away the seriousness of the act. We live in such a society today, that itaposs sad to say there are some very psychotic people out there that she might influence to actually do something like that. This morning Brand refused to apologise in the wake of a growing backlash and told The Sun she had nothing to say to people outraged by her comments. When askedshe would continue working with the BBC, she said: Iaposm not employed by the BBC, so how can they sack me   Her comments came as the Prime Minister Theresa May said the BBC should explain why it broadcast Brandaposs comments. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: The Prime Minister has been repeatedly clear that politicians should be able to go about their work and campaign without harassment, intimidation or abuse. I note that Brendan Cox has said that violence and intimidation should not be normalised and we should consistently stand against it. The Prime Minister shares this view. It is for the BBC to explain why it considers this to have been appropriate content for broadcast. Brand was asked about isions stoked by Brexit in a discussion with host Victoria Coren Mitchell on Tuesday. Brand said: Why bother with milkshake, when you could get battery acid  She added: Iaposm not gonna do it, itaposs a fantasy. At the end of show, Coren Mitchell said she hoped Brandaposs remarks had not caused offence but added that the radio series had been set up to test the boundaries of what itaposs OK to say and not say. But Sophie, from Poole,Dorset, says her comments are far from a joke. She said: Itaposs upsetting that someone like that in the public eye could even make a joke about it. I think itaposs absolutely outrageous. She should never have joked about it in the first place because itaposs not a joking matter.    There are people out there who have suffered before and for her to make a remark like that is just so upsetting. The word aposacidapos is a scary enough word as it is but for someone to say aposbattery acidapos is...I just think itaposs shocking for that to even go through her mind, to joke about it. Jo should go and to a burns unit and see what it does and seeshe can make a joke about it afterwards after seeing the trauma people have gone through.    There have been calls for the BBC to dump Brand and Sophie said: I donapost think itaposs my place to say whether she should be sacked or not but I do think she should be banned for a while so she can think about what she has said. Itaposs a serious matter and itaposs really concerning that she felt it was a normal joke. Itaposs not normal and she should be spoken to by the police.

The building in St Osyth, Essex, is known as ‘The Cage’ because of its use as a medieval prison where  so-called witches were kept while awaiting trial in . Three, including the notorious Ursula Kemp, were subsequently found guilty and hanged – but some believe their spirits have lingered at the site. Vanessa Mitchell, who has owned the building since , says her time at the house was plagued by hauntings and that a ghost there pushed her over while she was pregnant.  She fled the house in  and has been trying to sell it since, and now the home is back on the market for £,. Estate agents at Home Domus , who have taken charge of the sale, say they are pinning their hopes on a buyer who appreciates the paranormal. Spokesman Florent Lambert said: “Vanessa can’t live in the house because of the ghosts and she has tried to sell it a few times over the years without much success.  “I think it’s going to be pretty impossible to sell the house to someone that wants to live normally inside. “But there is such a big following and such a big market [for the paranormal] in the US and Japan, and England is obviously a place with a lot of history and a reputation for ghosts. “And there’s a market to turn the property into a holiday cottage with a twist – that twist being its paranormal edge. “So we are really trying to target someone that can turn it into a holiday cottage.”    Mr Lambert said his research indicated that most of the previous owners had only kept The Cage for roughly three years before selling. A previous owner had also committed suicide in the house, he found. It’s a history unlikely to appeal to potential homeowners, but the estate agent believes the building’s troubled past could make it a lucrative holiday rental.  “If you want it as a normal cottage,” he said, “you could probably earn let’s say £, to £, a year on rental, which would be a bit more than normal long-term rental. “As a paranormal cottage, however, you’re probably looking at getting at least twice that, because the market is probably not as seasonal.“That’s because you would typically use a holiday cottage during the summer, but in this case it’s not weather dependent. “Especially around Christmas and on gloomy days, it’s likely to attract tourists anyway.” The current owner also claims to have seen mysterious blood splatters at the house and to have spotted several ghosts, including what she feared was a satanic goat roaming the premises. Ursula Kemp was hanged for witchcraft after being accused of using her so-called powers to bring sickness and death to her neighbours.

Gloria and Ian Davidson spotted a dark creature with a head and neck as they drove alongside the lake on Tuesday. They stopped their car by Urquhard Bay and watched the creature for a minute before it submerged into the water again. Their sighting has been accepted and recorded as the seventh sighting of Nessie by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register. Gloria, , from Corbridge in Northumberland, told the Daily Record : We have been to Loch Ness many times, but never seen the monster before.But I always like to look at the loch - I canapost imagine how many pairs of eyes are on that loch at any one time. But I have spent periods looking at the water, because you never know. She was quite certain of what they saw as they stood about  metres away. She said: But at around .pm just after we had lunch, my husband was driving and I was in the passenger seat gazing out at the loch. Then I suddenly saw something and I said to Ian aposthereaposs something down there.apos He turned around and we got out of the car and there it was. We were very excited. It was about  metres away and definitely black. It seemed to have a neck and head. I could definitely see its back and it was a fair size. It disappeared after a minute beneath the water. I had hoped there was somethingin the loch - you always want to believe in something. All I can say is that we saw something we cannot explain. But it was animate and it was definitely not a seal.    Gary Campbell, recorder of the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings register said: This is our seventh sighting of the year and these are all very credible sightings. It is clearly Loch Ness and clearly unexplained. In terms of Nessie videos itaposs also very clear and we still donapost know what it is. It all adds to the mystery. But do these latest sightings explain the Loch Ness mystery - No  Do they add to the weight of evidence that there is something happening that is unexplained - yes. Itaposs said the first sighting in  of Nessie on January  was the earliest for  years. And the most recent sighting was recorded by a man called Mr Pycock on May . Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago, New Zealand, and his team have been taking water samples from the loch from three dferent depths on their research vessel Deepscan. The scientists collected DNA left by all creatures from their skin, scales, feathers, fur and faeces. The DNA samples were then sent to labs in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, and France to be analysed.  Prof Gemmell - an expert in genomics, ecology, population, conservation and evolutionary biology - said the data was tested against most of the main theories about the Loch Ness monster. While full details of the study are yet to be released, Prof Gemmell said one of the theories aposmightapos be correct. Is there anything deeply mysterious  It depends what you believe, he said. Weaposve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say arenapost right and one of them might be. Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the findings of the study in full next month - but would not confirm which hypothesis might be right.

An Irish Rail spokesman said: All under aposs travel for free, and we are offering the baby girl another  years until age .  We will be hoping to help mum out as well.   Passengers on board the train helped to deliver the infant, including a doctor who admitted he was terried, the Irish Mirror reported .Dr Alan Devine was on the train from when the young woman went into labour. The medical professional was on his way to a conference when the train suddenly came to a halt. He said: “I was terried to be honest. I probably shouldn’t say it but I was trying to do what they say ‘A duck in a pond’ does. It’s sliding along cool looking but underneath the legs are going crazy. It was a bit like that. “I’m a GP in training and not currently working as one. I would be far removed in dealing with this kind of situation. “Even my training when I would have assisted with births and that kind of thing, it would have been in the hospital and totally surrounded by midwives in a sterile environment. “But with this, it was totally chaotic and like ‘this is happening whether we like it or not so let’s deal with it as best we can.’ He joked: “I was listening to the American lady who was helping the woman with the breathing and was trying to keep calm myself.”    Dr Devine said three women, including two nurses, had the situation under control when he arrived. While he assisted the woman a section of the carriage was closed off and a blanket was held up by Irish Rail staff to ensure privacy as she gave birth. He added: “The whole thing was in full swing. I think it had been going on for - minutes before I even copped on. “She was in very good hands already. One of the girls, she was a nurse and there was another lady called Anne who was in contact with the ambulance service. “There was a more elderly American lady too who was also a nurse. Those three ladies were running the show and doing very well. “The two nurses were holding her hands and counting her contractions, helping her with her breathing and just reassuring her. “It was already being managed very well. I said I was a GP and askedthey needed any help and they were happy to have an extra set of hands and they were happy for me to get involved too.” He said it was a very frightening ordeal for the mother. He added: “She was terried of course. She obviously didn’t know this was going to happen so she was a little bit in shock, she was scared and was travelling on her own. “Medically there were other concerns, a baby being born on a train, you do be worried about how clean the environment is. But the mum did so well.  “I could see how painful it was to go through it and all the medication that goes with it, this poor woman had none. “Twenty minutes after I got there the baby came out with minimal fuss to be honest.” Ambulance services later arrived and transferred the woman and baby to the Coombe Hospital in Dublin. Dr Devine added: “I have been in contact with the mother since and everything is fine and going well.” A spokesman for the Coombe Hospital said that the woman involved did not wish to go public.

This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argylls got talent","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn exciting celebration of the creativity and talents of Mid Argyll young people will be on show at two fantastic events on Saturday June .In the afternoon, Lochgilphead High School’s final matinée performance of Romeo and Juliet will take place at .pm at the Joint Campus.

identied how to slow down the spread of the disease.Researchers at the University of Oxford have identied the specic antibodies produced within the immune system which help prevent the infection from spreading.Malaria starts with an infectious mosquito bite before the parasites spread to the human liver and into the blood, where they multiply -fold every  hours inside the red blood cells, leading to illness and death.The infection is caused when a protein called RH, which is found in the malaria parasite, binds to human protein.But Dr Daniel Alanine, co-author of the study published in scientic journal Cell on Thursday, said RH was ldquoa weak point in the blood-borne form of malaria.ldquoThe work just published has given us the first insight into the most effective ways for our immune system to attack RH in humans, he said.ldquoAn exciting and surprising finding to come out of this work is that a very specic type of antibody slows the invasion of malaria into red blood cells, giving the immune system more time to kill the malaria parasite.ldquoThis finding will allow us to design new vaccines which leverage this slowing effect for the first time by teaching the immune system to make this special type of antibody.Study co-author Matthew Higgins, professor of molecular parasitology at the University of Oxfordrsquos department of biochemistry, said: ldquoThis is an exciting finding because it shows that antibodies which do not prevent the parasite from getting into red blood cells might still be useful, by making the protective antibodies more potent.Simon Draper, professor of vaccinology and translational medicine at the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the university, added: ldquoWe know the key to stopping malaria is a strong immune response, and so every antibody counts.ldquoWhat we must do next is use these findings to develop an improved RH vaccine that induces more of the effective antibodies and less of the non-effective ones ndash this will ultimately make a better vaccine, and hopefully lead to an effective means of preventing malaria.Malaria kills approximately , people every year, according to the World Health

There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful meal accompanies swi agm","story":"President Jean Ives welcomed the members to the tearoom where Frances Hill provided the sustenance.The formal business included a review of the previous year’s events in which Southend#s SWI excelled, winning several events including bowls and a quiz.After a very successful year, the winter competitions# winner was Alison Eynon, who received the trophy, with Jen Ronald second and Fiona Rowland third.The retiring committee of Jean Ives, Fiona Rowland and Trish Jones were thanked for their hard work over the previous three years.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children. We were all treated like criminals, even though the majority of us hadnrsquot done anything wrong.ldquoMy daughter even turned to me at one point in tears, asking: lsquoWersquove done nothing wrong, why are we getting thrown out rsquoldquoI understand some of the behaviour was unacceptable, but there were young children on the trip and they should have been taken into account before the decision was made. To punish everyone for the actions of a small few seems very unfair.Flamingo Land did not respond for requests for a comment this week,Last week, spokesperson Andy Miller said: ldquoThe anti-social behaviour which was displayed by members of the football team in question couldnrsquot be tolerated as it was interfering with other guestsrsquo enjoyment.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  BBC   s disgraceful excesses have brought about this sorry mess","story":"As the BBC announces that from June  it will end free TV licences for over-s who do not receive pension credit, nostalgia for the Beeb of old will be tinged not just with regret but a sense of betrayal. Of course there will be thousands of this vintage who can cough up pound without a second thought, barely denting their cruise-ship budget or round-the-world jaunts. But we should be in no doubt there are just as many who, eventhey do not qualy for pension credit, will have to cut back on other essentials in order to secure this leline. And beyond them, hidden in the shadows, are those in serious poverty, who are too proud, too isolated or too uninformed, to apply for benefits they are due.The argument over whether the licence fee should be free for the elderly, however, is not, and should never be, entirely about affordability. It is a question of principle. We live in an age in which digital entertainment and news provision has become a Wild West frontier, offering myriad possibilities for those with access to online services, the skill to navigate them, and the cash to pay. Netflix, Sky, Amazon Prime and others all clamour for custom, chipping away at the BBCrsquos once-monolithic status. For a business with a glut of extremely well-paid captains at the helm, the corporation has been astonishingly slow to recognise the threat viewersrsquo changing habits pose to its future.I doubt there is anyone under  who would not blithely go where without a momentrsquos regret. Doubtless they already wonder why they should pay a licence on top of other subscription fees, especially when they can also stream much of what they want for free. But those who are over , who grew up with John Reithrsquos dream, are umbilically attached. The BBC schedule is the clock around which their day is constructed, be it The Archers, Test Match Special, the Six OrsquoClock News, or The Antiques Roadshow. Without this devoted audience, the BBC would have shrivelled long ago. It is to these stalwarts that Lord Reithrsquos baby owes its existence, and its prestige. To turf them overboard when money grows tight is not just disgraceful, it makes no sense.Announcing this decision, in the tones of a funeral director sorry for their loss, the BBC Chairman and Director-General explained the arithmetic in such a way that it seems there is no alternative. The end of Government funding for free licences will leave a pound million hole in its bank account. The alternative, they said, would be to close stations such as BBC Two and Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland Channel and Radio  Live, among others, all of which, clearly, is deemed unthinkable.Read more: Tories accused of broken promise in free TV licence rowYet the time for the unthinkable is not today. It was not even four years ago, when Westminster gave notice of pulling its subsidy. The moment for a strategic rethink and recalibration was  and more years ago. At that point, the exponential expansion of digital s was already transforming peoplersquos relationship with screen and sound. This was when the BBC needed to look hard at its role and purpose and come up with a remodelled, leaner profile, fit for a new century. Instead, it has continued to expand, astomorrow will never arrive.Many of the over-s, a generation bred to thrt, will be puzzled by the Beebrsquos fiscal philosophy. Stories of extravagant pay-outs and salaries, of a costly failed IT project, of wastefulness and excess, have dented its reputation as a wise user of licence fees. Surely, instead of penalising those on whose loyalty it has been built, it should be narrowing its focus and making ends meet For far too long the corporation has had delusions of grandeur. In trying to position itself as a front-runner in global as well as regional news, in attempting to capture every market and age group, it has spread itself too thin. In the process, its online sites have imperilled the existence of commercial media companies whose survival is not protected by licence-fee payers, as have its magazines.This is not to suggest giving programme-makers even fewer resources with which to produce the same output. Rather, it is to ask for a radical streamlining, a concentration of energies and talent, on the things the BBC has always done brilliantly: drama, documentaries, music and news. Instead of courting fickle youth, it should be actively nurturing and sustaining older viewers who depend upon it. Axing their free pass is not only an easy and predictable response, but unimaginative and short-sighted ndash symptoms, you might say, of what already ails it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9051137.jpg?type=article-full","title":"climate-for-change-bulletin-13th-june-19","story":"I took a call last week from a cleaning contractor at one of our more opulent flatted developments.We thought this might happen and now that itrsquos starting itrsquos going to pose a risk to le and property until as a country we come up with a cohesive plan of action.Dangerously ldquodaisy chaining three-pin domestic extension leads from communal sockets is going to become the norm unless the Government sits down with property factors and property owners and acts swtly.According to the consumer protection charity, Electrical Safety First, the explosion in numbers of plug-in electric vehicles in the UK has not been matched by the number of charging locations.

Furthermore, Ireland and the UK have agreed to an Exclusive Economic Zoneboundary that places Rockall within the UKs EEZ.The sole factual argument for the Republic of Ireland is that its mainland is closer to Rockall, than the Scottish mainland is to Rockall. However, the closest permanently inhabited island to Rockall is North Uist at  miles. Therefore, Rockall would be within the UKs EEZevenNorth Uist were to be used to determine the UKs EEZ, instead of St Kilda, which is  miles from Rockall.According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in : \"UNCLOS [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea] states that a rock or islet, such as Rockall, that cannot sustain human habitation or economic le of its own is not entitled to an exclusive economic zone or a continental shelf, but is entitled to a territorial sea. The UK claims a -nautical mile territorial sea around Rockall\".A -nautical mile territorial sea around Rockall equals  square miles, which is larger than Fe or East Ayrshire or South Ayrshire or Orkney or Shetland.The first literary reference to Rockall is in Martin Martins A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland published in , in which the inhabitants of St Kilda called it \"Rokabarra\".Scotland should not renounce any claim over Rockall as called for by Green MSP Andy Wightman , since by any objective opinion, Rockall belongs to Scotland.Incidentally, Rockall is further west than Ireland and is as far west as parts of mainland Iceland.Thomas Murray,Perth.NEIL Mackay says that the Scottish Government should not tell Irish fishermen to keep out of UK waters. Irish ships have been fishing off Rockall which is an uninhabited rock in the middle of the North Sea. The UK has long laid claim to Rockall as its territory because the closest inhabited land to it is, by far, North Uist. Ireland and Iceland dispute the claim, though their territories are much further away.What Mr Mackay fails to mention, however, is that Rockall is inside the boundary of the UKs Exclusive Economic Zoneand that Ireland and the UK signed an EEZ boundary agreement in . The boundaries have been agreed and Ireland is failing to honour them. It is sheer effrontery by Irish politicians to accuse the UK and Scotland of bullying when the latter have protested about Irish incursions into UK waters.The reasons that Mr Mackay gives to ignore Irish incursions are that Scotland and Ireland are historically Celtic nations and that a future independent Scotland will need Irish support in the EU. In other words, he advises us to let Ireland walk over us now because it might treat us better later on. I do not think many people in Scotland would support such a doormat policy. We expect people to keep to the agreements that they have signed, whether they are Celts, Gaels or some other tribe. Respect should be mutual, rather than one-way.Les Reid,Edinburgh.BOBBY McDonagh, former Irish Ambassador to the UK and EU, said this about the SNPs claymore-rattling over Rockall: \"The SNP Government, whose principal policy is to seek independence, is forcefully asserting its interpretation of UK rights more than the UK Government itself\". I can think of only three possible motives, none of which reflect well on my country..If its a belated sooking-up to Scots fishermen, this text I got from a prominent Aberdeenshire fisherman doesnt suggest its working: \"The Scottish fleet are totally mystied on whatrsquos it all about. It will have an ulterior motive but we have not worked out what yet. The Irish white fish fleet is very small andpossible has been decimated by the EU more than we have. Itrsquos the rest who have raped our waters\"It could be another virtue-signalling attempt to show up Westminster, or a \"power grab\" for a couple of frigates and a big tricorn hat so that Fiona Hyslop can carry out her threat that \"vessels will be deployed to take enforcement action against Irish vessels found fishing within  miles of Rockall\".

As he is a senior member of the financial services community, he knows that money has no borders, Dark Money even less.After glossing over the trivia that is the Tory Party, he turns his attack on the SNP. He writes: ldquoHave our roads, railways, hospitals and schools improved on the SNPrsquos watch  Well, roads for a start, he is obviously unaware that the first SNP Government intended to dual the A this was in its manesto and would be funded by the money set aside for the Edinburgh trams. The SNP was a minority government so was outvoted and the ruinous Edinburgh trams went ahead, at almost double the budget allocated the good citizens of Edinburgh are left with the cost, and there is an ongoing inquiry as to what went wrong. On its watch it had the Queensferry Crossing, on time and on budget, and is continuing to dual the A. The Aberdeen bypass was completed despite legal hurdles and the main contractor going bust.Problems with the railways are in the main due to the fact that the rail tracks are under the jurisdiction of Westminster, not Holyrood. The Borders Railway was also opened.The new Queen Elizabeth Hospital was opened in Glasgow, and Dumfries Infirmary and Orkney Hospital and healthcare hub were also opened. There are still problems with some of the hospitals built under PFI by Labour, but sorting them out is ruinously expensive.There are also problems with schools built under PFI, so some built in that era have had to be demolished and rebuilt. More pupils are leaving school and going on to further education, and unemployment is at its lowest for decades.Pinstripe is echoing the Scottish Tory leaders ldquoGet on with the day job which is exactly what the SNP has been doing.It is becoming clearer by the day that we are heading for a political and economic disaster for the United Kingdom, and while Scotland has been ignored and reviled, the DUP in Northern Ireland is being consulted ndash and bribed.Oh, I almost forgot, the SNP abolished prescription charges and bridge tolls, such a plethora of goodies not noticed by Pinstripe.Jim Lynch,Edinburgh EH."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9816553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"human-remains-discovered-in-dumfries-and-galloway-in-search-for-emma-faulds","story":"The -year-oldwas reported missing to police on Tuesday, April .The last confirmed sightingwas around .pm on April  when she was in Monkton, Ayrshire.Police searches had been focused around Barrhill, particularly along the A between Girvan and Newton Stewart.Police have discovered human remains in their search for Emma FauldsPolice Scotlandconfirmed that human remains havebeen found as part of their investigation into her disappearance.A spokeswoman said: ldquoOn Wednesday, June , human remains were discovered in the Galloway Forest, Dumfries and Galloway.ldquoThe family of Emma Faulds has been made aware.ldquoEnquiries are ongoing.Last month a man appeared in court charged with the murder of Ms Faulds.Ross Willox was also charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice on May  before ing to Ayr Sherf Court a week later for a second hearing.The -year-old from Ayrshire made no plea and was remanded in custody."},{"url":null,"title":"how-to-identify-and-get-rid-of-bedbugs-everything-you-need-to-know","story":":Scandal of Scottish schools four-year fight to kill off bedbugsFeasting on the blood of animals and humans, the small insects can leave a painful, itchy bite, often on exposed areas.Detecting bedbugsSigns of bedbugs can be hard to identy however there are some things to look out for including:While bedbugs do not fly or \"nest\" femalebedbugs may lay hundreds of eggs, each of which is about the size of a speck of dust.Getting rid of bedbugsIt can be a dficult task removing bed bugs once they have infested asthey can be resistant to some insecticides.In order to remove bed bugs: Clean bedding, linens, curtains, and clothing in hot water and dry them on the highest dryer setting Use a stf brush to scrub mattress seams to remove bedbugs and their eggs.:Community effort praised after bedbug outbreak at Glasgows St Brides PrimaryHoover your bed and surrounding area frequently.Encase mattress and box springs with a tightly woven, zippered cover to keep bedbugs from entering or escaping.

Huge congratulations to Margaret who has contributed so much to the area – she is an inspiration to many”.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aaron Bisset impressed industry professionals at Glasgow performance\"  Rothienorman actor signed by talent agency viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"AVA also celebrated the volunteers providing vital support services at Inverurie Day Centre.The centre is is available for older people, aged  or over and people with disabilities who enjoy social contact, but are less able to get out and about, or need support to manage day to day tasks.The Day Centre has a fantastic team of eight dedicated volunteers who supportDay Care Organisers Maggie McRitchie and Mo Ritchie to deliver activities for the service users throughout the day.

Critically, AGS in the latest approach restated their unwillingness to discuss or reopen the consultation on closing the pension scheme, which sets unacceptable preconditions for any further negotiations with Unite. Unite members at Aberdeen Airport have previously taken two twelve hour stoppages on  and  June at exactly the same time action was undertaken at Glasgow Airport. In April, Unite members at Aberdeen Airport supported strike action by . per cent on a . per cent turnout over the pay claim and the proposals to close the final salary pension scheme.Shauna Wright, Unite regional industrial officer, said: “Unite members will now undertake two further days of industrial action at Aberdeen Airport following this latest pitul attempt to ide and conquer by AGS. We want the public to understand that our members do not take this action lightly. But, AGS have repeatedly set preconditions to any negotiations by stating they will not reopen the consultation on the pension scheme, which breaks our Acas agreement with them.”“Unite members remain strong and resolute, and they are determined to stand united with their fellow members in Glasgow who are facing the same attack on their pay and pension scheme by AGS. For the record, Unite wants to reaffirm that we are always open to meaningful negotiations to seek a remedy to this dispute at any time, any place and under any auspices.

Mr Matheson said: ldquoSince the Scottish Government bought Glasgow Prestwick Airport in , we have been clear that it is our intention tothe business to the private sector when the time is right.ldquoThe senior management team at the airport has continued to engage with potential buyers and investors to discuss proposals for developing the business under new ownership.ldquoGood progress continues to be made by the airport to increase revenue, deliver operating efficiencies and pursue exciting opportunities for the future, including Spaceport.ldquoIn light of that progress, the airport will shortly place an advert in the Official Journal of the European Union inviting expressions of interest.ldquoAny proposals submitted as a result of the advert would be considered carefully before any decision was taken to est our shareholding in the airport or any part of the business.The Scottish Conservatives welcomed the decision to sell the airport.Ayr MSP John Scott said: ldquoIt is good news that Prestwick Airport is now being actively marketed for sale and I hope that a buyer can be secured at the earliest opportunity. ldquoDespite the problems the airport has faced over recent years, and the need for it to be taken over by the government in , I have always firmly believed that it has the potential for a bright future.ldquoPrestwick has all the foundations for success ndash the longest commercial runway and parallel taxiway in Scotland, a reputation of being Britainrsquos only fog-free airport, its own dedicated railway station, and a thriving aerospace campus.ldquoWhat it now needs is an owner prepared to put in the investment to take the airport forward as the major economic asset it undoubtedly is.In June last year, the airportrsquos chief executive told MSPs that passenger services from Prestwick Airport do not make any money.Giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee, Stewart Adams said: ldquoItrsquos clear that the passenger side of the business does not make money.ldquoPassenger numbers certainly need to increase but it is very dficult at the moment.Scottish Labourrsquos transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: ldquoThe government were far too slow in making the changes needed to turn Prestwick around when they bought it, and as a result itrsquos doubtful they will get back the pound million they have put in.ldquoHowever, the government cannot simply wash its hands of Prestwick.ldquoThey have a responsibility to ensure thata buyer is actually found, any sale must secure the jobs at Prestwick.ldquoAnything  would be an economic tsunami for Ayrshire and beyond.copy -.

But Dr Daniel Alanine, co-author of the study published in scientic journal Cell on Thursday, said RH was ldquoa weak point in the blood-borne form of malaria.ldquoThe work just published has given us the first insight into the most effective ways for our immune system to attack RH in humans, he said.ldquoAn exciting and surprising finding to come out of this work is that a very specic type of antibody slows the invasion of malaria into red blood cells, giving the immune system more time to kill the malaria parasite.ldquoThis finding will allow us to design new vaccines which leverage this slowing effect for the first time by teaching the immune system to make this special type of antibody. Study co-author Matthew Higgins, professor of molecular parasitology at the University of Oxfordrsquos department of biochemistry, said: ldquoThis is an exciting finding because it shows that antibodies which do not prevent the parasite from getting into red blood cells might still be useful, by making the protective antibodies more potent.Simon Draper, professor of vaccinology and translational medicine at the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the university, added: ldquoWe know the key to stopping malaria is a strong immune response, and so every antibody counts.ldquoWhat we must do next is use these findings to develop an improved RH vaccine that induces more of the effective antibodies and less of the non-effective ones ndash this will ultimately make a better vaccine, and hopefully lead to an effective means of preventing malaria.Malaria kills approximately , people every year, according to the World Health Organisation.copy -.

Barnes  Noble is the principal American book store company. They have over six hundred stores in the United States, and are a familiar presence in American shopping malls. For some years, though, they have not been doing as well as they might – a familiar story in book-selling. But now they have been acquired by the firm that already owns Waterstones, the UK’s largest book chain. Waterstones also used to have its problems,but then was itself bought by a Russian billionaire. He very wisely decided to appoint as its head a man who had a reputation for being able to sell books – James Daunt, who had built up a small string of highly-regarded book stores in London.James Daunt has the advantage in le – and business – of being one of the most agreeable people one could hope to meet. His approach was to make Waterstones bookshops friendlier, more locally-rooted places. This worked, and Waterstones recovered. Now he is going to New York to rescue Barnes  Noble on behalf of its new owner. He has said that he wants to make their stores nicer. He will probably do just that. If you want to make a business nice, the first step is to install a nice person at the top. But it won’t be easy. This is a story that has a major competitor in the wings, a company to which – and we may as well admit it – we all turn to buy everything from light bulbs to crushed flax seed, shoelaces to … books. It is very simple, and it is cheap. Light bulbs and the like may look after themselves, as their cultural implications are slight , but books are a very dferent matter. If book shops disappear because of the ease with which a website allows one-click transactions, then we shall all be immeasurably poorer. These shops are not just any old store, they are book shops – where words and ideas are laid out for us to explore.Buying a book online is undoubtedly convenient, and there is a place for it, but it does weaken the whole edice of book publication. First and foremost, it concentrates an immense amount of book selling power in the hands of a single provider, even , in theory, anybody can sell a book on line. That means that publishers might be required to give the on-line store deep discounts, and that, of course, means they will feel inclined to publish popular titles that will sell in vast numbers. Poetry, essays, and the like may not get a look-in.But it does more than that. When real bricks and mortar booksellers disappear we are denied the chance to browse. How many times do we enter a bookshop and discover an author we’ve never heard of, or a book that we would never have thought existed but that we feel we would like to read  In a real shop, you can start a le-time love affair with the works of a newly-discovered author, obscure or well-known.Bookshops are having a tough time of it, but the situation in Scotland is alleviated by the tenacity and dedication of many of our independent booksellers. These may be crop up in surprising places. One of the most applauded bookshops in Scotland is in a small Borders town – St Boswells, not a place with a very large population. It was here that Ros de la Hay, a former publisher, and her husband, Bill, set up their Main Street Trading Company. They have now added a deli to their offering, so that people can buy books, sample and purchase salami, and have a cup of coffee all at the same time . Main Street Trading was named Britain’s Best Small Shop in .Similar awards have been won further north, by the Watermill Bookshop in Pitlochry, where Jayne and Kevin Ramage have been enticing Perthshire people into buying books for some years. In St Andrews, Robert Topping, a highly regarded bookseller who has well-loved shops in England, in Ely and Bath, established a bookshop a few years ago. He hand-picks the books they stock in this bibliophile’s heaven. He will shortly be opening a new store in Edinburgh, joining booksellers such as Marie Moser, who runs Holy Corner’s gem, the Edinburgh Bookshop. These people are heroes and heroines of the book.These local bookshops, intimate in scale in an age of the big and the characterless, are little fortresses dedicated to defending an artefact that survives because we love it so much – the book. Electronic books are all very well, but you can’t touch the text you can’t smell the paper you can’t put it on a shelf to remind you of what it says you can’t wrap it up and give it as a present you can’t kiss its cover in gratitude. Actual bookshops survive because we love the physicality of the book – and want a real, physical existence rather than a virtual one. Still.

Here, in a town trademarked by its cantilever cranes and red-bricked rows of warehouses, nature reasserts her authority as the yawning expanse of the Firth of Clyde is foreshadowed by Gourock and framed by the rolling hills of Kilcreggan and Dunoon. It is an outlook which only improves during the summer months, and not on account of the erratic west coast weather the enhancement is provided entirely by the reassuring sight of the Waverley’s raked twin funnels coming into view, as she chugs down past the Tail O’ The Bank. From a distance, she appears a mere speck in the Clyde’s dull leaden-blue waters, almost insignicant against the grand canvas provided by Tom na h-Airidh and Ben Bowie. Yet all it takes for the roles to be reversed is a simple change of perspective. Stepping aboard the Waverley is to enter a world of sensory delights, a world which renders all outside it small and insignicant. Vast piston rods and cranks chatter away in unison, thrumming deep below right up against the soles of your feet. Above deck, a churn of gulls hangs expectantly over a comforting fug of hot oil and cold beer. She reserves the best, however, for when she is in full flow, as the unrelenting rhythm of her paddles scoop through the sea, an unstoppable force of industrial ingenuity thrashing ever forward through the years. Or so we hoped. The world’s last seagoing paddle steamer has been a fondly received visitor to communities scattered throughout Scotland’s western waterways for decades. When Caledonian MacBraynesensed that the days of folk heading “doon the watter” were numbered, they sold her in  for £to the Scottish branch of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society. No doubt there are some within CalMac who came to regret that decision, but equally, it would be a mistake to mock them for some perceived folly. The Waverley had lost several sailing days the previous two summer season to boiler problems, and the commercial case for her continued service was increasingly dficult to justy. CalMac, mindful of the ship’s heritage, presumed the society would tend to her in her dotage as a static attraction. Here we are, some  years and six million passengers later. The question in  is, having performed one resurrection, can she repeat the trick The boiler problems which troubled the grand old lady back then, and sporadically ever since,are now altogether more grave. The inner casings of the vast, oil-filled structures are damaged beyond repair. Their replacement is a process the steamship’s custodians liken to “open heart surgery,” and it will be expensive to boot. Waverley Steam Navigation Co Ltd, the charity set up to preserve the ship in operating condition, is hoping to raise £ million so that she canto service next summer. As Paul Semple, the general manager, concedes, it will be a “signicant struggle”. And yet for all the strain of the annual upkeep costs in the face of rising fuel costs and a stricter regulatory environment, there is undoubtedly a sound economic argument to ensure the Waverley stays afloat for years to come. The charity points out that the Waverley’s visits throughout Scotland, as well as to England and Wales, generates more than £.m for the UK economy each year. It is an impressive figure, and its real value lies in where the money goes. By virtue of the Waverley’s long-established routes to Scotland’s islands and sea lochs, she and her patrons call at small, rural communities which once thrummed with activity in their Victorian summer heydays. The Waverley alone cannot turn back the clock and fully restore their lustre, but when she arrives at one their piers teeming with  hungry and thirsty punters onboard, it is a cheering sight for local businesses. Just ask the staff in the Golfers, one of Rothesay’s great wee howffs, who can barely pull pints quickly enough to meet the demand as the tourists come ashore or those in the bustling Zaoni’s chippy, just a hop, skip, and stagger away from the boozer — ideal for those Waverley apostles in pursuit of the last fish supper before their beloved steamer sets sail for Glasgow. Of course, there are some who believe the Waverley’s proud heritage could be preserved without the expense and exertion of rendering her seaworthy once more. Those who envisage her as a floating visitor attraction would do well to look to Calornia, where the Queen Mary has been allowed to fester and decay under the watch of reckless municipal landlords. But the argument for permanently mooring the Waverley is built on deeper fault lines. It singularly fails to acknowledge how the only reason the ship is still with us at all is due to the hard work of generations of impassioned volunteers who simply refused to countenance the idea that the blast of her steam whistle would fall silent..We can, and should, rattle some cages to save an icon of Scotland’s maritime heritage, but it is a battle that will be easier won by remembering the Waverley is no museum piece. Her beauty lies in her . She wears her blood, sweat, and oil with pride.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs nicola sturgeon tells labour to back indyref2 to tackle poverty","story":"Nicola Sturgeon today urged Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard to \"see the light\" and change his position on a second independence referendum, after he backed a second EU vote.Challenged at First Ministers Questions by Mr Leonard on \"watering down\" Scottish Government commitments to eradicating fuel poverty, and asked to sign his letter to the UK government calling for the restoration of TV licences to pensioners over , Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Labour leader was raising \"reserved matters\".She said: \"Let me say to Richard Leonard the regulation of energy prices in this country is a reserved matter.

Secondly.I did understand what you said but you clearly didn’t understand it yourself.In your example, a party was standing in what was essentially a single-issue election and stated its policy with clarity and precision.Given these very specic factors, under what circumstances would this party be elected by voters who did not support the policy In order to justy your “honouring, then ignoring the plebs” insult, you created a  scenario.Incidentally.It shouldn’t make any dference but when I replied to your comment, I had no party axe to grind.No, Malcolm, it is you, not I, who fail to understand. My point referred to the LibDems conduct during and after the EU referendum # #People#s Vote# # of  June . The recent EU election is merely the latest episode.The Remain-supporting UK government sent a £ million, taxpayer funded leaflet to every UK home, recommending Remain and stating # in big, bold type # that this was a #once in a generation# event, adding, #The government will implement whatever you decide.#No party dissented. Indeed, Nick Clegg repeated it forcefully in a nationwide tv debate .The next day, LibDems leader Tim Farron furiously rejected the outcome . Since then, the LibDems, and others, have campaigned ferociously to reverse the result.They have traipsed around Brussels, encouraging EU negotiators while undermining our own, effectively, #colluding with a foreign power# to wreck Brexit. And all the while demanding a second referendum in which the people would be frightened into voting Remain by the unpalatable EU offer that they helped to ensure.I am unable to recognise that as in any way democratic.John,The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. The Liberals adopted a pro-European stance in the  advisory referendum as did the Lib Dems in the  advisory referendum.They also presented pro-European policies in all the national and European elections between those dates and up to the present.Their MPs and MEPs have been consistently elected by pro-European voters who expect them to stick to their pro-European election manestoes.There are countless dferent types of constitutional democracies around the World and they are all slightly dferent.If you watch events in the House of Commons, you will notice that there are neat rows of benches provided opposite the government’s benches.They have been there for hundreds of years and they are there for a very special reason.They exist because, in our form of constitutional democracy, the losing side is allowedto continue developing and promoting the positions set out in its own manestoes.The losing parties do this in direct opposition to the policies of the government who were elected by the majority.That is why the losing parties are called “The Opposition” and their existence is not something that contradicts democracy but is, in fact, an essential part of it.You can’t expect the opposition parties to take a vow of silence just because someone put a leaflet through your letterbox in .#The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. #But the least they should do is respect the result, not demand it is overturned.Ok., Malcolm, I seem to be having dficulty making it through the editorial filter so I#ll have to agree to disagree. Neither have I #a party axe to grind.#Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast bar and nightclub could be replaced by apartments","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For years I was liaison with the Garda, and the truth is we weren’t treated very respectfully, we never got the policing we asked for and we were not protected.“I have no objection of members of the Garda taking part in a personal capacity, but we’ve forgotten what Pride is supposed to be about. It’s about resistance and solidarity, the fact that we will defend each other in good times and bad.“That’s what it commemorates, and there’s a recalibration needed.”The Pride alternative will take place at the same time as Dublin’s main parade on June .We are absolutely delighted to announce that the proposed route for the  #DublinPride Parade and March will see usto the very heart of our city! 🌈🌈🌈 The parade will assemble on Parnell Sq on Sat, June th and will end in Merrion Square with a free outdoor event. pic igpuFjftuo— Dublin LGBTQ PrideApril , An Garda Siochana announced in April that unormed gardai will take part in this year’s parade for the first time.Announced by Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan, the move was labelled “a signicant step that demonstrates An Garda Siochana’s commitment to building the inclusive Ireland”.Queer Action Ireland says the inclusion of gardai is an affront to the foundations of Pride.“The participation of gardai in unorm in this year’s parade is in direct opposition to the liberatory principles of Pride.“The police continue to target LGBTQ+ people, sex workers, migrant and other ethnic minority people in Ireland today. Just this week, gardai have arrested migrant sex workers on both sides of the country.“Cops marching in Pride is not a sign of progress, but rather a representation of the further cooptation of our struggle. While police will make concessions and recruit from our queer and migrant populations, their role remains the same.”Queer Action Ireland also says it cannot march alongside the festival’s media partner RTE: “A broadcaster who welcomed transphobic hate speech on to the air not months ago, and whose commitment to so-called ‘balanced’ reporting has led to the perpetuation of dangerous ideas and rhetoric around the island of Ireland, that endangers the lives of the queer community.”RTE director-general Dee Forbes replied: “As Ireland’s national public media organisation, with a unique place in Ireland’s cultural landscape, we are proud to promote our vision to celebrate Ireland’s rich ersity by supporting the Dublin LGBTQ+ Pride Festival.”Pride celebrations worldwide have been criticised for over-commercialisation, with claims that large multinational corporations use the events as a marketing , without meaningful policy or advocacy behind their inclusion.“We cannot march in a parade that so readily welcomes corporations who see our community as no more than a marketing demographic,” Queer Action Ireland said.The Pride Alternative starts at pm on Rosie Hackett Bridge, and organisers say the event will be about “listening to each other, highlighting queer struggles, and drawing attention to the issues that face our community today”.Jed Dowling, director of Dublin LGBTQ Pride Festival, said: “Pride is always a mix of the personal and political.“No one owns Pride, nor should they. We never want to tell anyone what it should mean to them or how they should express it. Diversity and inclusion of all parts of our community is always welcome and never a bad thing.”Dublin’s Pride celebrations run from June  to ."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit and theresa may have inspired childrens creativity","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_dda-c-b-ac-fa_EmailA new and effective vaccine against malaria could be created after researchers identied how to slow down the spread of the disease..pushResearchers at the University of Oxford have identied the specic antibodies produced within the immune system which help prevent the infection from spreading.Malaria starts with an infectious mosquito bite before the parasites spread to the human liver and into the blood, where they multiply -fold every  hours inside the red blood cells, leading to illness and death.The infection is caused when a protein called RH, which is found in the malaria parasite, binds to human protein.Antibodies which do not prevent the parasite from getting into red blood cells might still be useful, by making the protective antibodies more potent.Study co-author Matthew Higgins, University of OxfordBut Dr Daniel Alanine, co-author of the study published in scientic journal Cell on Thursday, said RH was “a weak point in the blood-borne form of malaria”.“The work just published has given us the first insight into the most effective ways for our immune system to attack RH in humans,” he said.“An exciting and surprising finding to come out of this work is that a very specic type of antibody slows the invasion of malaria into red blood cells, giving the immune system more time to kill the malaria parasite.“This finding will allow us to design new vaccines which leverage this slowing effect for the first time by teaching the immune system to make this special type of antibody.”   Study co-author Matthew Higgins, professor of molecular parasitology at the University of Oxford’s department of biochemistry, said: “This is an exciting finding because it shows that antibodies which do not prevent the parasite from getting into red blood cells might still be useful, by making the protective antibodies more potent.”Simon Draper, professor of vaccinology and translational medicine at the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the university, added: “We know the key to stopping malaria is a strong immune response, and so every antibody counts.“What we must do next is use these findings to develop an improved RH vaccine that induces more of the effective antibodies and less of the non-effective ones – this will ultimately make a better vaccine, and hopefully lead to an effective means of preventing malaria.”Malaria kills approximately , people every year, according to the World Health Organisation."},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership contest live boris tops vote as three candidates eliminated","story":" Hi degC |

support, including seven US Navy ship passages over the past year through the strait iding China from Taiwan.China criticises the high-level visits and the naval ship passages.Chinese President Xi Jinping said in January that the two sides should be ruled like Hong Kong, which is grappling with mass street protests targeting Chinese control.Hong Kong is part of China under a “one country, two

Possible Nationalist candidates include Terry Gou, chairman of the world’s largest consumer electronics assembler, Foxconn Technology, and Han Kuo-yu, the populist mayor of southern port city

Beijing because she rejects its dialogue condition that both sides belong to a single China, and seeks a closer relationship with the United States.China has reacted by picking off five nations that had diplomatic ties with Taiwan, scaling back Taiwan-bound group tourism and flying military aircraft near the island.“Looking at the Taiwan election from China’s point of view, another term for Tsai would be a disaster,” said Denny Roy, senior fellow at the East-West Centre in Honolulu.China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the Chinese civil war, when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists lost

who ‘shook the world.’Inez was a trade union leader and human rights activist that made an indelible mark in her sphere of influence and far beyond that as well.The first woman president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions , Inez McCormack was at the forefront of the UNISON union and campaigned highly successfully for the inclusion of equality and human rights in the Good Friday Agreement in . She was also the founder of the human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights-a group that supported disadvantaged groups which she continued to advise until her death.Inez Murphy was born into the Protestant tradition in Cultra, County Down in September,  and after her initial studies won a position as a junior clerk in the Northern Ireland Civil Service at -years-old whilst working towards her A levels at night.At this tender age the budding champion of trade unionism didn’t fully appreciate what was actually happening in Northern Ireland and later recalled: “I was a puzzled young Prod. Until I was , I hadn’t knowingly met a Catholic. I was a young Protestant girl who didn’t understand that there were grave issues of inequality, injustice and ision in our society.”Inez McCormack’s first contact with Derry came in the years - when she attended Magee College. It was the era when the decision to locate Northern Ireland’s second university at Coleraine. The experience provided her with her first taste of ‘street politics’ and an initial glimpse at how power was abused. Between - she attended Trinity College in Dublin and it was there that she met Vincent McCormack.The pair married within three months of meeting and as her husband was a founding member of the Derry Labour Party, when they ed to Derry Inez had a first-hand insight of the growing Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. She was on the People’s Democracy march that was attacked at Burntollet by loyalists as it approached Derry in January,  and later described the era as “living through a historical defining moment.”Later in , having begun to study for a Diploma in Social Studies Inez McCormack began a career as a social worker in Ballymurphy, in . The West Belfast housing estate, ravaged by the Troubles also suffered great levels of social deprivation and in the midst of that an attempt was made to shut the Social Services office down and the workers were to be moved to a dferent area.Realising the need for them to stay the workers refused to leave Ballymurphy and they were advised to join a trade union to help them resist the pressure to go. Inez McCormack contacted the National Union of Public Employeesand all the workers were accepted as member with Inez acting as shop steward. By , she was working part-time for the union.NUPE would eventually become UNISON and in , Inez McCormack became the first female full-time official with the daunting task of achieving , members in the first five months of her employment.Realising that part-time women workers in the public sector were normally dismissed as ‘too dficult to organise’ and so weren’t part of a union, Inez McCormack began the process of signing them up.She said: “My whole mode of mobilising them was to make them see that their needs were real, that they were somebody.\"By the time UNISON was formed in  Inez had increased the union’s membership from  to ,. She went in to become the union’s first woman regional secretary and continued to represent low-paid women cleaners, home helps and nursing auxiliaries. Between - she was the first woman to chair the Northern Ireland committee of ICTU and became its first woman president in .Inez McCormack’s achievements were all the more remarkable coming as they did in a very male dominated world. But those achievements did not come lightly.\"At one meeting I was booed off the  and called scum. I was talking about child care and was told that it shouldnt be on a trade union agenda.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“To those \"inclined to take a stand against inequality or the abuse of human rights\", McCormack asserted that \"the fallout for the inidual can sometimes be brutal, but it is emphatically worth it,” she said.She was also a signatory to the MacBride Principles for fair employment, and succeeded in galvanising Irish-American opinion to combat the early unpopular reception to the Principles in Northern Ireland. The MacBride Principles were signed into US law in , and brought the power of US investment against the practice of religious discrimination in employment in the North.In the build-up to the  Belfast Agreement saw the adopted Derry woman running a brilliant campaign to have equality and human rights provisions included. Inez McCormack viewed this as being key to conflict resolution founded on the practice of justice.She saw that those most affected by violence in the North came from the most socially deprived communities. So, Inez McCormack’s campaign asserted the rights of the most socially excluded and she said: “Our job is to put the areas and people who are excluded at the centre of our economic and social planning and show that we can actually tackle the unjust and unstable conditions.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive

unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17676207.fermanagh-women-tell-their-stories-through-needle-and-thread/resources/images/9559549.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Traffic delays as emergency services at scene of accident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

It’s one of the areas that people have the lowest opinion of and the lowest expectations for. Duncairn Centres arts and events manager Ray Gfen“That’s the fuel in our tank, to change that and show how quality arts-led programming can impact that. It also lets the funders out there see the benefits of arts and creativity in changing society.”The arts centre is located in a predominantly nationalist area of the Antrim Road in the former Duncairn Presbyterian Church, which provides an inspiring backdrop for those within the building.This weekend will mark the second visit of RTE’s Other Voices to the centre. One of the highlights will be an acoustic performance to less than  competition winners from multi award-winning Northern Ireland band Snow Patrol on Saturday evening.The Duncairn Centre is run by the  Trust – a Christian community development group set up in . Presbyterian minister Rev Bill Shaw OBE has been the trust’s director since .Ray said: “We knew we had a good starting point in that Bill and the  Trust were highly respected here.“This is a long game. I’d say in the first year there would have been % coming from the PUL community, the rest would have been locals . “Just last year, it was up to around about -% from the PUL community. That was through programming, running specic events and targeting groups. Once we get people in to see what we’ve got they’re impressed.Traffic delays as emergency services at scene of accident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We carried out impact studies and one of the most interesting statistics we got was that % of people we surveyed from outside of the area who had attended just one event said that before the Duncairn Centre they would never have come to north Belfast.“This is why we’re here, to give people a reason to come to north Belfast, to create a shared space, to bring communities together.“This is a part of the city that has been starved artistically and creatively. We needed to go all in with this. I’m extremely proud of the work we’re doing here. We’re punching well above our weight.”He added: “Our organisation – the  Trust – is very much rooted in peace and reconciliation. “Both Bill and I are passionate about arts, and community building using arts and creativity as a vehicle to bring people together.“I think he and I are a good starting point. We come from completely dferent backgrounds.” Bill is a Presbyterian minister who was awarded an OBE for services to the community in north Belfast, while Ray comes from the nationalist community and from a family of musicians and music lovers.Ray said: “We get on extremely well. What lies at the heart of that relationship is that we love people and we want to give people a chance to shine.“We don’t ask people where they come from or what their political views are. “We are Belfast right to the very marrow of our bones. We love the city, the people, warts and all.”With the help of funding the Duncairn Centre has grown into a hub of music, arts and creativity hosting regular concerts, discussions and workshops led by artists in residence.Ray said: “A lot of what we do is about music. Music is the one thing that is relevant to everyone in every walk of le. It’s got the power to bring people together.“I look at the creative community as a moral compass because they think dferently, creatively, imaginatively, about how to overcome problems. Artists don’t really do barriers to collaboration, they celebrate dference.“We encourage discourse, but the one thing that is required is respect. Respect has to be earned through people’s actions and how they deal with each other.”Of the centre’s ethos Ray said: “We’re more than just an arts centre. It’s easy just to set a programme of classes. What makes us dferent is the thought, the follow up, the support, the empathy that underlies all of that. We’re conscious of mindfulness, community building, encouraging creativity and educating people. Then there’s purely and simply the enjoyment element – giving people a break.”try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Matheson said: ldquoSince the Scottish Government bought Glasgow Prestwick Airport in , we have been clear that it is our intention tothe business to the private sector when the time is right.ldquoThe senior management team at the airport has continued to engage with potential buyers and investors to discuss proposals for developing the business under new ownership.ldquoGood progress continues to be made by the airport to increase revenue, deliver operating efficiencies and pursue exciting opportunities for the future, including Spaceport.ldquoIn light of that progress, the airport will shortly place an advert in the Official Journal of the European Union inviting expressions of interest.ldquoAny proposals submitted as a result of the advert would be considered carefully before any decision was taken to est our shareholding in the airport or any part of the business.The Scottish Conservatives welcomed the decision to sell the airport.Ayr MSP John Scott said: ldquoIt is good news that Prestwick Airport is now being actively marketed for sale and I hope that a buyer can be secured at the earliest opportunity. ldquoDespite the problems the airport has faced over recent years, and the need for it to be taken over by the government in , I have always firmly believed that it has the potential for a bright future.ldquoPrestwick has all the foundations for success ndash the longest commercial runway and parallel taxiway in Scotland, a reputation of being Britainrsquos only fog-free airport, its own dedicated railway station, and a thriving aerospace campus.ldquoWhat it now needs is an owner prepared to put in the investment to take the airport forward as the major economic asset it undoubtedly is.In June last year, the airportrsquos chief executive told MSPs that passenger services from Prestwick Airport do not make any money.Giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee, Stewart Adams said: ldquoItrsquos clear that the passenger side of the business does not make money.ldquoPassenger numbers certainly need to increase but it is very dficult at the moment.Scottish Labourrsquos transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: ldquoThe government were far too slow in making the changes needed to turn Prestwick around when they bought it, and as a result itrsquos doubtful they will get back the pound million they have put in.ldquoHowever, the government cannot simply wash its hands of Prestwick.ldquoThey have a responsibility to ensure thata buyer is actually found, any sale must secure the jobs at Prestwick.ldquoAnything  would be an economic tsunami for Ayrshire and beyond..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Prestwick Airport to be sold off by Scottish Government article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But Dr Daniel Alanine, co-author of the study published in scientic journal Cell on Thursday, said RH was ldquoa weak point in the blood-borne form of malaria.ldquoThe work just published has given us the first insight into the most effective ways for our immune system to attack RH in humans, he said.ldquoAn exciting and surprising finding to come out of this work is that a very specic type of antibody slows the invasion of malaria into red blood cells, giving the immune system more time to kill the malaria parasite.ldquoThis finding will allow us to design new vaccines which leverage this slowing effect for the first time by teaching the immune system to make this special type of antibody. Study co-author Matthew Higgins, professor of molecular parasitology at the University of Oxfordrsquos department of biochemistry, said: ldquoThis is an exciting finding because it shows that antibodies which do not prevent the parasite from getting into red blood cells might still be useful, by making the protective antibodies more potent.Simon Draper, professor of vaccinology and translational medicine at the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the university, added: ldquoWe know the key to stopping malaria is a strong immune response, and so every antibody counts.ldquoWhat we must do next is use these findings to develop an improved RH vaccine that induces more of the effective antibodies and less of the non-effective ones ndash this will ultimately make a better vaccine, and hopefully lead to an effective means of preventing malaria.Malaria kills approximately , people every year, according to the World Health Organisation..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New malaria vaccine possible after researchers identy  uweak point u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
