A judge granted the Empire actor permission to travel to L.A. to visit him on Monday Newly-unearthed tweets from a Twitter account used by brothers - Ola and Abel Osundairo - in 2013 where they make homophobic remarks may also be used as evidence in the case. \u0027Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that n***a gay right,\u0027 Ola tweeted at a man in 2013. Another tweet read: \u0027YOU\u0027RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.\u0027 It\u0027s unclear who Ola was referring to in that tweet.The actor\u0027s explanation for a $3,500 check he gave one of the brothers, which they say was payment for the hoax, is that he was paying him for personal training.          Smollett\u0027s bond was set last week by Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke (pictured). It is unclear who gave him permission to go to California Smollett, according to prosecutors, had previously bought drugs off from one of the brothers and knew them because they had appeared on Empire as extras. On January 29, the day of the attack, he called them an hour before it happened and an hour afterwards, according to prosecutors.He also spoke to them when they were in Nigeria for two weeks afterwards.  Smollett has not entered a plea yet.He is charged with one count of filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony which carries a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine. After being released on bond last Thursday, he went immediately to the Empire set to tell his colleagues he was innocent.  On Monday, Superintendent Eddie T.

The leader of the European Research Group writes that the Northern Ireland backstop in its current form would last indefinitely and needs to be changed The Northern Ireland backstop has always been the biggest sticking point in the negotiations – and for a very good reason. I am as determined as anyone that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should remain as peaceful and problem-free as it is today.However, in its current form, the backstop – which would allow for an open border between the two countries, leaving Northern Ireland subject to certain rules of the EU\u0027s single market – would last indefinitely.May survives latest Commons showdown as hardliners start to...EU could insist on a Brexit delay of TWO YEARS if May\u0027s deal...Share this articleThe whole point of leaving the EU is to take back control, not to leave the EU with the potential for lasting effective power over trade and regulations in Northern Ireland, or any other part of the UK.If this issue can be resolved, then I would be content to support the Prime Minister\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement.Geoffrey Cox, the much-respected Attorney General, is in Brussels trying to persuade the EU to agree to a legally binding date to the backstop.          Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, is trying to secure concessions on the backstop It would be wrong to jump the gun, but if he can achieve this it would mark a fundamental change to the agreement and allow Brexiteers such as me to accept it. Once we can secure a limit to the backstop, all the other imperfections in Mrs May\u0027s deal, such as continued meddling by the European Court of Justice and our continuing to pay huge sums into EU coffers, become much less problematic.The key difference is that these are all time-limited, whereas the backstop, as currently outlined, is potentially everlasting.Once a final date is put on it, our objections to the deal, like the effects of its provisions, fade away.I really do not mind what form of words the Attorney General and the EU agree on regarding the backstop – as long as it expires before the next election and has the same legal status as the deal. And I do not agree with those who say the Withdrawal Agreement has to be reopened to solve the backstop problem. It is itself an appendix to the treaty, so I would be happy with a further appendix, as this would have equal legal force.In my view, that would satisfy most of us who are worried, and it may also help those who say the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be reopened to save face. I take a practical and not a theological attitude towards these matters.Those who have suggested that I and my Conservative colleagues in the European Research Group have gone out of our way to make things difficult for the Prime Minister could not be more wrong. Our aim has consistently been to follow the commitments made in the 2017 Tory election manifesto and implicit in the 2016 referendum result.          Prime Minister Theresa May (pictured leaving Parliament this afternoon) is still determined to keep to the March 29 departure dateThat some Cabinet ministers have undermined collective responsibility and tried to thwart Mrs May is hardly our fault.The Prime Minister says it is still her fervent hope that the UK leaves the EU on March 29. I share her sentiments.If – and I stress if – she can secure the necessary assurances on the backstop I have outlined, I would be delighted to support her deal and help avoid any delay to Brexit.It is not my job to tell other Conservative MPs what to do, but I am sure many other passionate advocates of Brexit would take the same pragmatic and patriotic view.At long last, we would have delivered our promise to the 17.4 million who voted to leave the EU in June 2016.And, as soon as that happens, we Conservatives can put our differences behind us, reunite and focus on winning the next election – and keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of Number 10. "},{"url":null,"title":"Stacey Dooley criticised Labour MP David Lammy","story":"Labour MP David Lammy criticised Stacey Dooley for appearing in a Comic Relief documentary in Uganda which promotes \u0027tired and unhelpful stereotypes\u0027 and for encouraging a \u0027white saviour\u0027 complex - sparking a war of words between the pair          The Labour MP for Tottenham (pictured from behind) said today that her comments showed she had \u0027failed to educate herself\u0027, adding on BBC News\u0027 Victoria Derbyshire show: \u0027Her Instagram conveys the age old trope that is her as the heroine and the black child as the victim and we have to stop it\u0027  Miss Dooley arrived in Uganda 5 days ago, posting pictures of her trip including holding this child.

The beginning of his bitterness when he realized that was never going to happen. #Delusional.’Now, you might expect Trump’s sons to spring to his defence and brand Cohen a liar – again.What would be far less predictable is that CNN, Trump’s least favourite news organisation, did the same.          When Cohen said he didn\u0027t want to work in the White House, Twitter exploded. Cohen himself even said he\u0027d wanted to work in the White House During a panel debate about Cohen’s testimony, CNN’s top political correspondent Dana Bash said: ‘The one potential problem that I thought Michael Cohen has is when he was asked if he wanted a job in the White House and he said no. Our reporting….all of us have been told by people in and around the process at the time he very much wanted a job at the White House.’‘Very much,’ agreed CNN anchor Jake Tapper.Tapper then played the clip of Cohen’s claim ‘because a lot of us raised our eyebrows because we knew it to not to be true.’Afterwards, he added: ‘The issue is that one sentence ‘I did not want to go to the White House. All of our reporting suggests that’s not true.’Later in his testimony, Cohen doubled down and again said ‘I did not want to go to the White House’ and insisted he had told President Trump he wanted to continue working for him as an outside personal attorney.Yet CNN reported Cohen wanted a job at the White House but was edged out by Trump’s family, and was named personal attorney to mollify him.CNN said he had been particularly keen to be Chief of Staff and was ‘crushed’ when the job went to Reince Preibus instead.I think it’s safe to assume CNN, that despises Trump as much as he despises them, would not be reporting all this as a favour to the President. They reported it because it’s true.And we know it’s true because Cohen himself admitted as much in a CNN interview with Chris Cuomo in 2016.Asked if he expected to work with Trump when he moved to the White House, Cohen replied: \u0027Oh, I certainly hope so’, adding he would ‘a hundred per cent’ accept a position.So Cohen lied yesterday again, about something relatively innocuous.And if he lied about that, then what else did he lie about?Cohen says Trump sent him signed personal checks to pay off porn stars, but was it a retainer for general services?Cohen says he overheard Roger Stone tell Trump that Julian Assange had told him in a phone call that Wikileaks was about to dump their damaging Hillary emails. But both Stone and Assange have categorically denied any such conversation ever happened.Cohen says he heard Trump spew racist abuse as they travelled through a black neighbourhood in Chicago. But there is no tape (Cohen taped a lot of things) and no witness.Cohen says Trump was aware of the infamous Tower meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer. But the detail of how Trump was supposedly imparted this news is distinctly inconclusive.In the end, most of what Cohen revealed is stuff that has yet to be independently verified or corroborated, and some of it cannot be as only Cohen and Trump were there.If it’s all true, then President Trump is undeniably facing serious charges and may well have broken several laws.But as I watched Cohen’s pathetically manipulative, sniveling and disingenuous performance yesterday, I found it very hard to believe almost anything he was saying.  As I watched Cohen’s  manipulative, sniveling and disingenuous performance yesterday, I found it very hard to believe almost anything he was saying.

Just as the creature postulated by physicist Erwin Schrödinger is both dead and alive in a box until it’s opened, so the artist in Hirst is either genuinely brilliant or absolutely terrible. Predicting if you’ll get the freaky genius or his arrogant twin is an impossible exercise in quantum criticism.Which brings us to his hobby of collecting and curating other people’s art. At his Newport Street Gallery, Hirst puts on exhibitions from his own hoard that veer from pop kitsch to porn paintings. Yet in his latest throw of the dice, he reveals his most courageous and sensitive side. What public gallery would dedicate such a generous, heartfelt exhibition to two British artists who were far from fashionable in their lifetimes and might easily sink into oblivion now they are dead?John Bellany died in 2013, his friend Alan Davie a year later. Bellany’s self-portrait in hospital and portrait of the elderly Davie are displayed, emotionally, at the start of the exhibition. They made their names as painters in the 1950s and 60s and, by the time of their deaths, were seen as part of the staid and sterile RA establishment of British art that had been thrown in to the dustbin of history by none other than Hirst and the punk-conceptual art revolution he led. Yet here is Hirst giving them a lavish elegy.The paint hits you like a shrieking sax solo in the first of Newport’s perfectly lit meditative spaces. Davie played jazz after he was demobbed following the second world war. His paintings are primal improvisations of percussive marks and slobbering riffs. His 1951 canvas Untitled Female takes us into a bedsit studio in austerity Britain where sex explodes rebelliously out of the chilly air: breasts drawn in black paint, Picasso-style, boom out of a chaos of pinks, yellows, reds. There is a graffito of the painter’s cock and balls in there, too.Davie’s paintings in this show date from the 1940s to 60s – and they are mighty. He was one of Britain’s few really convincing abstract painters. Free from any hint of gentility or St Ives-ishness, his abstractions have cojones – lots of them, crudely sketched into fierce, frenzied surfaces. While Davie is manifestly in thrall to the shamanism of Jackson Pollock, emulating not only his drips but his early obsession with Jungian mythological imagery, he also has a lot in common with Cy Twombly and Jean Dubuffet, in the way he mixes modernism and street art. In his ritualistic 1958 painting Insignia of the Gannet People, a hammer shape is delineated in white under a storm of markings while lines radiate out in a cartoon image of magic power. It looks, for all the world, like it belongs in a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat.Bellany’s paintings are interpersed with Davie’s, and they suffer for it. The best are the earliest. Bellany’s 1963 work The Crucifixion is a morbid array of pieces of dead fish, tacked up and displayed on a table in a grotesque parody of religious art. Unfortunately, in later works such as 1972’s Celtic Voyage, with its gathering of mythological characters I can’t quite care about, he strays from visceral truth into tepid painterly fringe theatre.Still, there’s nothing wrong with being made to look at an artist you wouldn’t ordinarily bother with. For this exhibition has an enthusiastic interest in the byways of art history. There’s a lot more to British art, Hirst effectively says, than pickled cows. There have been some riotous painters – and not just the handful you’ve heard of. British history looks different through less familiar eyes. Cliche has it that the 1960s were liberated. That’s not how Bellany sees Scotland in his furious 1969 triptych Homage to John Knox, with its Goya-esque panorama of bigots and witches, or his equally enraged portrayal of disapproving puritans entitled God Is Love (1968).It’s as if Hirst wants to take apart the shallow instant histories in which British art changed for ever when a young artist called Damien Hirst curated Frieze in a Docklands warehouse in London in 1988. Supposedly, he and his generation blew away the painterly cobwebs of postwar British art with readymades. It’s not like that, says this engrossing celebration of paint. What’s the difference between a painting of dead fish and a display of actual dead fish? Bellany, Davie and Hirst at their best were all young artists trying to say something about life and death, making strange art in a strange little country – sometimes getting lost, but sometimes hitting the gory vein of life.• John Bellany and Alan Davie: Cradle of Magic is at Newport Street Gallery, London, until 2 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14333506379c01533a125e03397425d7789d03ed/0_0_1800_1440/master/1800.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fedff54aab91ff416050cca38070d08 480w","title":"laura bates witch hunts never stopped now theyre online","story":"The lurid accusations and arbitrary punishments meted out in centuries long gone are all too reminiscent of the way young women are harassed and blamed todayIf you were tried for witchcraft in early modern Scotland, one of the surest ways to be convicted was to confess. Of course, you didn’t need to confess to be convicted, and confession wasn’t always voluntary. This problem led to a practice called “waking the witch”: a form of torture that involved depriving the accused of sleep for days on end, until they were so exhausted they would hallucinate and babble incoherently. These “ravings” would often later be used as evidence of guilt.It sounds barbaric and antiquated: accusing a woman of being strange and unnatural, driving her mad with constant prodding, depriving her of sleep. But it also sounds chillingly familiar. I was reminded of a teenage girl I had recently met who, after an incident involving a boy at her school had gone viral on social media, began being bombarded with abuse by her peers. They called her a slut and a slag on multiple internet platforms. They shared embarrassing photographs of her, while forever escalating rumours started to spread. But unlike my own adolescence, when some escape from school could always be found at home, this young woman’s life had become a prison of endless abuse. The alerts and notifications pinged directly to her phone, vibrating through the night, causing her to become more and more panicked as sleep deprivation set in. Having initially rejected the labels others were assigning to her, she started to fear that they were right. It’s hard to hold on to who you are when dozens of people are telling you that you’re worthless. Does this sound like an exaggeration? For thousands of teenage girls across the UK, it isn’t.As I dug deeper, uncovering the details of inidual trials, I was struck by the similarities between the women then and the virtual witch hunts young women are going through today. “Dunking”, where a woman was submerged in water as either punishment for being a “scold” or to ascertain her guilt in a case of witchcraft, reminded me of the girls I meet now who find themselves trapped between two bad outcomes. Like being put under enormous pressure to share nude photographs, then rejected for being frigid if they refuse or castigated as sluts when they relent.Many trials – like the memorable case of the woman accused of cursing a man by giving him a permanent erection – suggested that women’s feminine wiles gave them unfair control over men, whose own sexual behaviour was framed as involuntary. I read the stories on train journeys, on my way to school visits where I would meet girls who had been punished for school dress-code violations, who were told that the sight of their shoulders, knees or bra straps was unfair to male teachers or risked distracting the boys. I heard from girls who had been sexually harassed or even assaulted by boys at school, groped and upskirted as they climbed stairs between lessons. In some cases, their predominantly male supervisors’ only answer was “boys will be boys”, with any blame placed on their own dress or behaviour. (“He probably just likes you: did you do something to lead him on?”) Girls whose images were shared online without their consent were frequently given punishments equal to or greater than those who had done the sharing. Many were forced out of school altogether, some because of sexual bullying and others after enduring draconian punishments for the crime of being a victim.The parallels kept mounting. Women accused of being somehow inherently dangerous and powerful. Their bodies blamed for causing innocent men to behave in ways they could not control. Punished and shamed for their sexuality, their guilt determined and punishment executed by groups of powerful men.And even today, young women who dare to call themselves feminists risk attracting the same label: witch.As I spoke out about what I had seen and heard on my school visits, people often responded by bemoaning the perils of social media and the problems they had created for young women. As if these were new and startling issues that had arisen purely because of technology.One day, I stumbled across the story of a young woman named Maggie, who lived in a tiny fishing village in Fife in the mid-17th century. Her treatment by her local community 400 years ago seemed near-identical to the experiences of the girls I work with today. As I read about unmarried, pregnant Maggie who was confined to the “cutty-stool”, a three-legged chair raised above the church congregation on Sunday, so she could be humiliated by the minister in front of her neighbours, I knew I had to tell these stories side by side. Derided as a “harlot” and a “limmer” despite being the victim of abuse, Maggie was accused of witchcraft after the man who had harassed, impregnated and then abandoned her was lost in a fishing accident.I wanted to give a voice to the girls whose stories still aren’t being heard, whose accusations are so often disbelieved and whose bodies are blamed for their own injuries. I wanted to remember the women whose voices have been lost to history, never allowed to speak out or record their own version of events. And most of all, I wanted the opportunity to say: Look! This isn’t a new story. It’s not a modern invention or a problem created by the internet. It won’t go away on its own, unless we do something to change it. These stories  four centuries.

But nothing is certain in the face of a hostile Home OfficeAs theatre, Brexit loses out to drying paint. It is mostly excruciating. Time and again we are promised a high noon shoot-out with cabinet walkouts and armies of pitchfork-wielding Tory rebels, but then anti-climax: the real drama happens behind the scenes as our flawed heroine surrenders, leaving a damp squib finale in the Commons. It’s like the Richard II scene when the king calls off mortal combat between two nobles: that doesn’t end well. Today’s virtually Brexit–free front pages tell the story: no fighting is boring, boring, boring.Yet what happened this week in Brexit has been momentous, even if we were denied catharsis. Battle honours go to Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin demanding the Commons’ right to vote down a no deal and extend article 50. They have saved the nation from the utter catastrophe revealed in the no-deal documents Anna Soubry prised from the cabinet. Backing for the CooperLetwin amendment from an unprecedented 20 ministers threatening resignation forced Queen Theresa to concede: she is ordering her troops to vote for a contradiction to her every Brexit word so far.Climbdowns don’t come more dramatic. If there is an ounce of tragedy in her story, it’s here: she could have been a leader had she ruled out the appalling prospect of no deal from day one, had she convened all sides with flexibility instead of with her impossible red lines. Look what else was revealed last night: when the tide went out, the ERG were revealed to be swimming naked, with only 20 – just 20! – of their hardest of hardliners voting against the amendment that would deny their yearned-for no deal. It is almost tragic that May has been held captive by lunatics who turn out to be only a Potemkin army, all noise and striped waistcoats, no trousers.The next hero is the one lone Tory who voted for Labour’s far better Brexit plan to stay in the customs union and close to the single market – Ken Clarke, father of the house, whose every wise and witty utterance routs the brainless inanities of the David Davis, Andrea Leadsom, Iain Duncan Smith, Mark Francois stupid party. Jacob Rees-Mogg, meanwhile, filled the London Palladium this week – an apt venue for this music hall grotesque.But the surprise hero was an unknown, Tory MP Alberto Costa, who rode to the rescue of EU citizens living here and Brits living abroad, together numbering at least 5 million. Their rights will be assured in any kind of Brexit. All this time May has resisted giving security to people whose lives are deeply, invisibly, inisibly interwoven into the fabric of British life. Her hostile environment has terrified families, some of whom have departed already, unwelcome under her chill xenophobic glare. What a mighty, swerving U-turn – and why should Costa be forced to resign his role as a parliamentary private secretary for his actions? Last night the whole house unanimously nodded through with no vote what should have been pledged the day after the EU-hating referendum result.But Costa will have to keep campaigning. The hostile environment in the Home Office still needs to be vanquished with the registration scheme revised, otherwise, as the House of Lords EU justice sub-committee chair, Helena Kennedy, has warned, the home secretary faces “another immigration policy scandal”. The committee’s letter to the home secretary highlights the disaster lying ahead: the Home Office has learnt no lessons from the Windrush scandal, ploughing on with an EU settlement scheme riddled with faults.Applicants can only apply online and only on android phones. As with Windrush, the unknowing will suddenly find themselves unable to work, use the NHS or rent a property if they don’t register by the two-year cut-off date with all the correct old documents, which many won’t have: the3million campaign is indunated with examples of vulnerable people at risk of being wrongly deported.The Lords committee has taken plentiful evidence about those who can’t use computers, can’t fill out forms, are in care homes with dementia or are EU children in care whose councils may not register them. Human lives are infinitely complex: what happens to domestic violence victims and others whose husbands won’t register to bring in their children? What happens to the unregistered who return to their native country to care for aged parents, but find they are barred from returning, even if their children are here? Why are none given a document to show they belong here? Instead, they get a letter saying they are registered, but a warning saying that the letter is not a legal certificate.The only evidence is their number inside the Home Office computer, which any would-be employer or landlord has to access via a government computer to confirm. Many employers and landlords will avoid the complexity and choose someone else instead. Why not issue everyone entitled with a welcoming document?The tone has been hostile, not friendly. Meanwhile, figures released today show the number of EU migrants coming to Britain is falling fast – now at its lowest level since 2009 – with the number of non-EU migrants conversely at its highest since 2004. Was this the intention of the referendum?Rollout begins in a month, the government boasting its two pilots went swimmingly, but they only tried it on universities and NHS employees – the competent young and IT-experienced. What of the Italian grandmother living here since the war, who never knew she needed to register – and has no correct documents? What of the Bulgarian whose passport is in Cyrillic? There is no office to visit and no “settled status” certificate at the end of the process.

The results are conclusive. George Galloway shouldn’t have gone on Celebrity Big Brother: 13 years later, the image of Galloway pretending to lick milk from a bowl held by Rula Lenska, another contestant, still overshadows in most minds anything else he has ever done.Penny Mordaunt shouldn’t have gone on the ing show Splash: like it or not her political legacy will now include one spectacular belly flop, lovingly captured and replayed in slow motion from four angles during the show. And Nadine Dorries shouldn’t have gone on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, for which she was suspended from the Tory party, just a few days before she was humiliatingly booted out of the jungle itself.It is therefore difficult to imagine what has possessed Dorries – at this serious time in national politics – to go on another reality TV show. This one, ITV’s The Junk Food Experiment, marketed itself as a pseudo-scientific investigation, feeding five celebrities nothing but pizzas and fried chicken and seeing what happens. This is both a tired idea and a disgusting one, and involves, as all of these types of programmes do, close-ups of celebrity meat sweats, close-ups of open-mouthed chewing, and a bit where burgers are whizzed up in a blender.Much of the programme is dedicated to discussing Dorries’ bowel movements, which feature both in coy voiceover (“Nadine has always had a cordial relationship with her lavatory, but this diet has definitely led to an outbreak of hostilities …), and from the source herself (“I’m passing rabbit pellets!”) as the camera pans grandly across the Palace of Westminster. At one point she produces a stool sample in the loo of her House of Commons office (the camera films the toilet door during the process, waiting for the flush), and later sits at her desk as she is given the results over Skype.Dorries claims she is doing it to raise awareness of obesity – a good idea, in theory – but the viewer may wonder whether her job as an MP might be an even better platform from which to do this – particularly at the point in the show where she has eaten so much junk food that she cannot remember her House of Commons speech on obesity. It is a rare politician whose career is helped by public humiliation. Can she really hope to wield greater influence on obesity legislation now that ITV viewers have seen her stool samples?Politicians who go on reality TV tend to justify it in three ways. Raising awareness for some cause, starting discussions about politics, or to “humanise” politicians. All three are flawed. MPs are in possession of far more power than most to champion a particular cause – it is a waste of their time to “raise awareness” in such indirect ways as charity challenges or TV shows. Any attempt to discuss politics will probably be cut out by producers. And the public tend to want their MPs professional and capable, not eating kangaroo testicles. Humanisation is overrated, particularly when it involves time away from politicians’ real jobs (or “day jobs” as Dorries’ is referred to in The Junk Food Experiment).The real reason Dorries is on the programme may instead have been revealed quite accidentally, as she introduced herself to Peter Andre in the first few minutes of the programme. “You don’t know who I am do you?” she said cheerfully, as Andre searched his memory. “I’m Nadine. I was in the jungle?” Politicians who go on reality TV do it for one reason: vanity.• Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6f560865b9240018cc34cd2a057784c077659ae/0_176_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e2dbfc65fd46b412ce981b8bdaa34a7","title":"roman britain phalluses hadrians wall","story":"Leave an image of a penis up long enough, and it will become part of our national heritage. The rush to record inscriptions made in a Cumbrian quarry in AD 207 has cast a spotlight on the rich legacy of graffiti in Britain by the Romans. Masons sourcing stone blocks for the nearby fortifications of Hadrian’s Wall carved a date, a phallus and the caricature of an officer. They were not alone in leaving their mark. Hunting for images of phalluses is one of the great pleasures of walking the wall. Look attentively enough, and they can be found repeatedly along its line.Graffiti was always a mark of Roman life. In Rome, the right to draw it was widely regarded as a civic prerogative. In a society rigidly stratified by wealth and rank it provided an essential safety valve. Slogans scrawled across the city served up to everyone who could read such a relentless dishing of dirt that people fretted that its sheer weight might bring walls crashing down. Even the illiterate would defecate on the monuments of those who had offended them. Soldiers, by virtue of the oath of duty they swore when signing up to the army, had abdicated the rights that were the essence of citizenship – but many were the legionaries who sought to ease their boredom by scratching doodles on quarry walls. Tiles stamped with a unit’s name would often bear graffiti. Ferocious though military discipline invariably was, it did not serve to iron out all the habits of civilian life.Which was why, carved on to bridge abutments, mile castles and the courtyards of headquarters, phalluses were such an invariable feature of the empire’s northern frontier. The preoccupation with male genitalia was common across the Roman world. In Rome, the phallus was everywhere to be seen, protecting doorways as a symbol of good luck, guarding crossroads, or scaring off birds in gardens. Ramrod size in a male was much admired. A generously endowed man hitting the bath-house might well be greeted, as one Roman writer put it, with “a round of nervous applause”. A citizen equipped with such a weapon, particularly a young one, “in whom a degree of animal-spirits was natural”, could hardly be expected to keep it permanently sheathed.Even the sternest of moralists acknowledged this. To the Roman mind, a brothel was not so different to a latrine: dirty and disreputable, yes, but serving an essential purpose as a receptacle of human waste. A man could no more be expected to ignore his sexual needs than he could a full bladder. Not for nothing did the same word, meio, mean both “urinate” and “ejaculate”. A thrust or two, deep and quick, like the stabbing of a sword into the guts, and the business would be done. A Roman penis was something potent, masterful, prodigious.Naturally, to provincials in a military zone such as the one stretching south from Hadrian’s Wall, the implications tended to be alarming. A phallus that in Rome might serve as a good luck symbol was liable to appear far more menacing when it appeared above the doorway of a fort. To any native straying into the vicinity of Hadrian’s Wall without the requisite documentation, it would have served as a peculiarly intimidating reminder of Roman power. Rape was an accepted way for the military to enforce their authority. It was the rape of Boudicca and her daughters, after all, that precipitated a crisis that almost reversed the conquest of Britain.A penis was not simply a penis. Its association with weaponry – swords, spears, arrows – was taken for granted by everyone who spoke Latin. Hardwired into the language was the assumption that to rape someone was to stab them. A legionary, when he fought, would thrust with his sword at the stomach of his enemy, spilling out the guts, desanguinating his foe. No less than the sword, the penis served a Roman soldier as the emblem of his power.The masons who 1,812 years ago carved a phallus on the Written Rock of Gelt at Hadrian’s Wall were not just indulging in a bit of Carry On-style cheekiness. They were making a statement that every native would have understood. At much the same time, at the opposite end of the empire, a traveller named Lauricius was riding through Jordan. At Wadi Rum, he paused to carve his own piece of graffiti. There was no phallus this time, but the message was identical. “The Romans always win.”• Tom Holland is a journalist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb12310e55350b31e48ec8f1c0679dd98cf0940/0_236_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6012e39c6b8a866826779559ff4f0713","title":"school stockport close early fridays lack funding","story":"Teaching unions warn schools are at ‘absolute breaking point’ following budget cutsA state school in Greater Manchester is to close early on Fridays from September and charge parents who cannot pick their children up at lunchtime, in what teaching unions said was a sign that schools are “at absolute breaking point”.Vale View primary in Reddish, Stockport, is believed to be one of at least 25 schools in England to take the drastic measure of shortening the school week in order to cut costs.The chair of governors raised hackles among parents by trying to sell the half-day as a boon for families. “With such busy lives, we are sure many families will want to take advantage of their children finishing earlier one day a week a great opportunity to catch up, tackle homework or just have some quality family time,” wrote Dr Ricky van Deursen in a letter to parents earlier this month.The headteacher, Helen Hannah, said the remark was “well intentioned” but understood why it angered parents who worked or had children at different schools. Yet she insisted there was no alternative.Statutory pay rises had led to a £100,000 budgetary black hole and she was already making “double-figure” redundancies out of a staff of 90, Hannah said. Reneging on the early Friday closure would lead to more layoffs and bigger class sizes of up to 40 children, she warned.From September, classes will finish at 12.45pm each Friday. Parents who will not be able to pick up their children early will have to pay £3.50 per child to cover the costs of an after-school club.Governors said they had already cut almost £400,000 from the school’s budget since January 2017. Art therapy is due to stop in July, saving £9,500, and support for speech and language therapy has already been reduced by £16,000.The school has saved a further £50,000 by cutting subsidies for school trips, £40,000 on support for pupils sitting their year 6 Sats exams, £100,000 on resources and £136,000 by not replacing teaching assistants when they left or retired.One parent said he was troubled by the move: “Not just because of the impact on the children, but on all the staff as well. This is a school that tries very hard for all of the children, so I believe them when they say that this is the least worst option.” The father criticised the chair of governors, who “could have demonstrated better understanding of parents’ situations by not suggesting that they enjoy more leisure time with their children … Many families around here are scraping by and making do as it is, and this change absolutely will not help them or be welcomed.”Schools in Stockport, one of Greater Manchester’s wealthier boroughs, got a raw deal, said Hannah, the headteacher since 2017. Reddish is one of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods, but pupils there receive £650 less than their counterparts a few streets away in Manchester, she said.“Running a school in Stockport costs exactly the same in terms of teachers’ salaries and the cost of providing a good curriculum, and yet a comparable Manchester school half a mile away would receive £350,000 more per year in basic funding,” Hannah added.The school insisted children’s learning would not be jeopardised and timetabled teaching time would be reduced by just 20 minutes each week because the school day would be slightly extended from Monday to Thursday.Hannah said she had received 21 emails from parents of the 550 pupils about the change. “Half were supportive and half were against. The emails against focus on the inconvenience of the closure on Fridays and the cost of childcare: even though it is reasonably priced, it’s a cost that parents have got to find,” she said.She insisted the change was definitely happening “unless there was a significant change in funding”.Andrew Gwynne, the local Labour MP, urged the government to increase school funding: “My message to ministers is clear: don’t hide behind false statistics suggesting you are protecting school budgets. This is a direct consequence of cutting the per-pupil funding in deprived communities like Reddish and the children in Reddish deserve a proper, decent, full-time education.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said shortening the school week should be ringing alarm bells for the government.“School budgets are at absolute breaking point. School leaders have made all the obvious savings – now they are faced with having to make major changes to the way they provide education,” he said.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the trend of early closures in England was connected to the funding cuts many schools were facing.“Headteachers are having to make decisions that no one working in schools and colleges ever thought they would have to make,” he said.The government said it did not know how many schools had introduced half-days because they are not required to notify the Department for Education (DfE). But Hannah said she had liaised with headteachers in Calderdale, Bradford, Manchester, Birmingham and London who “have all done similar or are doing so”.A DfE spokesperson said: “Any changes made to the school day need to be reasonable and parents need to be adequately consulted before changes are made, so that they can make alternative arrangements for childcare.“We have protected the core schools budget overall in real terms since 2010, and put an additional £1.3bn into core schools funding across 2018-19 and 2019-20, over and above plans set out at the last spending review.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3abecd8debf3b17b8c945b404dee5c66172ef04/0_282_8272_4965/master/8272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=416d2925cca52da4637105a476d479ef","title":"pests homes spider man bug biolgist 5000 species","story":"Biologist Rob Dunn is the David Attenborough of the domestic sphere, uncovering everything from microbes in the shower to spiders in the basement. He goes on safari in the dusty corners of one Copenhagen homeThe good news is that I will never be home alone again. The bad news – well, it’s not in fact bad news, but it is slightly unsettling – is that I share my home with at least 5,000 other species: wasps, flies, spiders, silverfish and an exotic bunch of wild bacteria.All that information is apparently contained in a patch of grey dust I have just swabbed with my right index finger from a door frame in my living room. It’s like a DNA test of my house, says Rob Dunn, a 43-year-old American biologist who has come to my house in Copenhagen to hunt microbial life. He carries no lab gear and his blue crewneck jumper and striped Oxford shirt are hardly the combat suit of an exterminator. But with every discovery we make, with every spider we find lurking in the corner or each swab of dust, he displays an almost childlike sense of excitement. He swears and smiles, even whoops with delight: “This dust sample contains bacteria, your body microbes, your wife’s body microbes, your child’s body microbes. If you smoke weed we would find marijuana DNA in there. Everything is visible, but it’s also present in every breath. Every time you inhale, you inhale that story of your home.”Dunn is to house insects and indoor bacteria what Marie Kondo is to neatly folded shirts. He wants us to study the wildlife in our homes and realise that what we discover should spark much more joy than fear. When he began working as a biologist he went to the jungle to study wild beasts, but now his research is dedicated to species much closer to home: to the flies, spiders and bacteria hidden in every nook and cranny of our kitchens, bathrooms and basements. To the “jungle of everyday life”, as he describes it in his new book.Dunn is in Copenhagen for work and has agreed to come to my home to go through dusty corners and spider webs to point out where I might find some of the 5,000 species I bunk with. I suspect our 110-year-old house, shared with another family, is a fertile hunting ground, and Dunn seems optimistic. Using a screwdriver and tweezers, he pokes at light fittings and sifts through the basement, which can be a mould-friendly hangout during sticky, wet summers. While I’m making coffee, Dunn lets out a yelp: “Oh yes, this is good!” He has spotted a globe-shaped lamp hanging in the basement hallway, and in the bottom of the hazy glass cover is a Pollockesque pattern of dead wildlife. He tips the contents of the lamp on to a fold-out table and uses the tweezers to organise the harvest: two types of fly, a wasp, a meal moth, some aphids and various planthoppers. He takes a closer look at two of the dead flies: “I can tell they are likely to be the same species, but I don’t know for sure until I look at their genitals.”He turns to the silver-shiny meal moth. “Isn’t it just beautiful? It moved in with humans in ancient Egypt and has moved with humans again and again.”But how would it have ended up in our home?“This meal moth could have come in with grains.”Like from a box of cereal?Dunn wants us to see our homes the way we see our gardens. There are pests and pathogens we need to control – those that make us sick – but we also want to preserve ersity. He says fewer than 100 species of bacteria, protists and viruses cause nearly all infectious diseases today. We try to keep these in check with vaccinations and antibiotics, and by washing our hands. But that leaves us with a jungle of tens of thousands of other species, many of which we know little about, but which Dunn’s work suggests can often be more beneficial than harmful. For example, studies have shown that a higher ersity of bacteria on people’s skin – bacteria linked to soil and plants – can reduce the risk of allergies. He also mentions the discovery of a bug that could be a new source of useful enzymes: by testing the microbes in the gut of the camel cricket, found in many American homes, Dunn’s research team discovered bacteria that were able to break down industrial waste and turn it into energy. Making “cool discoveries” like this and enlisting the public to sieve through their homes for wildlife has spurred interest in a field he says has been neglected for too long.“The first drawings of microscopic life are all of household species,” says Dunn, “but once we figured out the germ theory of disease it shifted, and both scientists and the public started to think that what was indoors belonged to pest control. Ecologists went to the Galapagos, we went to the rainforest, but it pushed us away from the home and it left us with this huge blind spot.”I’m not sure I’m ready for an in-house pet spider, but while our natural inclination might be to shriek or stamp them out, Dunn wants us to protect them. “The natural enemies of the pests in our homes are very often, whether you like it or not, spiders,” he writes in Never Home Alone: “If you kill the spiders in your home (and this is precisely what we do with many kinds of pesticide applications), you do so at your own expense.”The curse of pesticides brings us to the bathroom and another key area of his research: shower heads. Dunn and his team asked people from across the US and Europe to send in swabs from their shower heads. And within the biofilm – “a fancy word for the gunk” that builds up inside them – they discovered a pathogen, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), that is linked to lung disease in people with weak immune systems. What they didn’t know was why this pathogen seemed more prevalent in some regions than others. “There was more of the NTM in the US and in particular in chlorinated water,” says Dunn. They came to the conclusion that “residual chlorine kills all the competing bacteria and just leaves the NTM, which are chlorine-intolerant.” And when the competition is eliminated, the pathogens thrive.He unscrews the shower head from the hose and runs his finger along the rubber fitting. There is very little biofilm-gunk, which he credits to the quality of the local water supply. “Most of Copenhagen still has untreated groundwater that relies on the wild bioersity of crustaceans and bacteria to clean it. But if you break that – like we do in the US – it’s super-expensive to fix it and it sucks. And it makes you sick.”Crustaceans? “Yes, in some cases you can encounter small crustaceans in the tap water here. Denmark tastes like bioersity.”We continue through the living room and kitchen. He pulls a book from the shelf to test for book lice, and picks up a log of firewood that has a spidery, grey pattern of reindeer lichen growing on the bark. In the kitchen he checks the dishwasher soaptray for a particular form of bacteria that is otherwise only found “in the faeces of tropical fruit bats”. Even our salt jar is apparently full of life: “Almost every crystal of salt has bacteria inside, and when you brine something in salt, those bacteria contribute to the flavours of the brine. The longer it sits in the brine, the more the microbes in the brine are going to contribute to it. Isn’t that cool?”Food is an area where Dunn has found the influence of microbes and bacteria to be more palatable to people he meets. Food is alive – whether it’s sourdough bread, kimchi or beer – and we are cool with that. Much more so than with the spider crawling across our windowsill. Dunn describes a study of how specific microbes found on bakers’ skin influence sourdough starters and the flavour of bread. His team gathered 15 bakers at a facility in Belgium and tasked each of them with making sourdough starters from identical ingredients. When they tested the bakers’ hands afterwards, it showed a close relationship between the microbial makeup of each starter and the bacteria found on the skin of the baker who made it. In his book Dunn describes how the bakers and biologists, drunk on spontaneously fermented Belgian beer, tucked into the breads and broke into an impromptu toast: “‘To bread, and to microbes!’ And to a house in which both are delicious. ‘To bread and to microbes!’ And houses in which we are all healthy. ‘To bread and to microbes!’ And to lives filled with wild species we have yet to study or understand, species that float like mysteries all around us and offer services we are only beginning to measure.” Our house tour and inspection has come to an end. I’m curious about the professor’s verdict. Is this a happy, fungi-rich, insect-thriving home? “You have a lot of species that I think of as being part of a healthy house,” Dunn says. “To me, your house is rich in bioersity and seems dominated by those things that you either shouldn’t worry about, or that are beneficial. Also, I don’t see antimicrobial products all over the place.”He points to the leftovers of a coffee kombucha-glazed Danish pastry we were eating earlier. “And then you have things that spark joy for you: fermented pastries, salt that’s alive and healthy water from Denmark that we know is alive.”As he says goodbye and walks down the garden path, I spot a tiny moth in our living room, flapping frantically in the corner. I don’t freak out or necessarily feel any great joy, but I leave the moth be. After all, there are 5,000 of us here, and you need to give your housemates some privacy.• Never Home Alone by Rob Dunn is published in the UK by Basic Books (£22.99) on 14 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2fcbd1b8f378f744783a219a53726dce3a0366/0_169_4307_2584/master/4307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=524f17bbcef17722ed55f1f80cf5328f","title":"chloe gives highlands twist to its traditional parisian chic","story":"Natacha Ramsay-Levi’s designs are inspired by UK scenery as she remembers Karl LagerfeldWhere do French girls go on holiday? Hiking in the Scottish Highlands, according to the Chloé’s creative director, Natacha Ramsay-Levi. The designer, whose adopted brand has been the ultimate purveyor of ultra feminine and Parisian chic since its inception in 1952, may have had a Mediterranean-beach-hopping and souvenir-shopping woman on her moodboard last season, but now she is kitting out her customer for a winter expedition.Chloé being the luxury house that it is, however, meant Ramsay-Levi didn’t let the ruggedness run away with her. This was about as polished as explorer-chic gets, with smooth leather handbags and hardware adding shine. A continuation from last season’s souvenir chic, necklaces took on a talismanic theme, she said, featuring horn and shark-tooth shaped charms and resin amulets. Tufts of horse hair were also prominent on the accessories, making a nod – along with the galloping horse soundtrack – to the house’s equestrian roots.Its heritage was a focus of today’s show with the company paying tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, who was the house’s creative director for a total of 25 years, spread over two stints. “His joyous capturing of the spirit of the Chloé woman is eternally treasured by us and by everyone who felt the freedom and beauty of wearing his clothes,” said the show notes. 39-year-old Ramsay-Levi – who arrived at the house in 2017 – paid her own tribute backstage after the show, revealing that his designs at the house regularly inform her own.“For me Karl Lagerfeld is what I have known of Chloé since I was a child … It was always about a strong femininity and glamour.

Enjoy might not be the first thing that springs to mind, but it might be time to get onboard as, over the past year or so, adding a handful of mushrooms to your hot drink, chocolate or energy bar has become an increasingly normal thing for people to do.Reishi, boletus, cordyceps and lion’s mane sound less like mushrooms and more like things you reluctantly take as a last ditch attempt to clear up a patch of eczema – and, indeed, high claims have been made for their supposed health benefits. Most sellers talk up their products’ antibacterial, antiviral and immune-enhancing properties, but don’t go so big on the fact that, say, cordyceps are parasitic fungi that grow on insects (mmmm, is that my stomach rumbling?).So, does parasitic fungi grown on insects taste nice when dropped into an espresso? Fans online have described mushroom coffee as tasting somewhere between tea and coffee (which sounds like the kind of thing you get from the ’s office drinks machine no matter what you order), so I headed to Planet Organic in north London for one of its Superfood coffees, a combo of reishi, maca, espresso and hazelnut mylk. The barista describes them as a popular choice: “Not world famous, but they have a … cult following.” As if by magic, the person queuing behind me steps up to order a mushroom coffee. “And she’s not even being paid by the  to do it,” I think to myself.The drink tastes surprisingly non-weird: there is a slightly unusual bitter finish, but it doesn’t exactly scream: “Oi, you’ve got mushrooms in your drink, you weirdo.”This lack of mushroomness turns out to be a regular occurrence in the world of shroom food. For instance, you probably wouldn’t detect any mushroom in Pollen and Grace’s hazelnut, praline and reishi Super Square unless you had been forewarned – maybe not even then. The variety of mushroom chocolates I test also taste overwhelmingly funghi-free: Hifas da Terra’s agaricus blazei chocolate tastes like slightly dusty dark chocolate, whereas its chocolate, marron glace and boletus is nothing more alarming than “pleasantly nutty”. Only its chocolate blend of cordyceps sinensis and pollen feels suitably earthy – enjoyable for me as a lover of both mushrooms and weirdness, but arguably less so for my colleagues, whom I caught screwing their faces in disgust as they sampled it. After a week of mushroom eating, the only thing I can find that tastes definitively of mushrooms are Other Food’s slightly more traditional oyster and shiitake chips – whole mushrooms crisped up and marketed as a healthy alternative to crisps.None of these products come cheap, it should be noted. The chocolate bars could set you back £6 to £8 for a 100g bar, while even the bag of crisps pushes £3. Is it worth it? That really depends how much you believe the health-benefits spiel. To me, the shroom craze appears to be just the latest stage in the wellness era, where increasingly strange-sounding powders and potions are disguised in your drink in return for a hefty price tag. It might make sense to save your cash for making a fancy risotto instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93a4f9c50ad406b50a62403876ee408eb5019ec7/0_180_4463_2677/master/4463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6e8bb7805c6ef203237ea5a56cb487f","title":"claudio ranieri sack fulham premier league scott parker","story":"• Italian set to depart after three and a half months in the job• Scott Parker asked to take charge of team for rest of seasonClaudio Ranieri is set to be sacked by Fulham, with the club’s directors and supporters having lost confidence in him.

This was only the fourth time he has completed 90 minutes under Ole Gunnar Solskjær and they were his first goals in almost two months, and yet there is a sense Lukaku as much as anybody is benefiting from the burst of Norwegian sunshine over Old Trafford.Perhaps it does not seem like much for the 10th most expensive signing in history to pull level with the presenter of a daytime-TV property show. It should be acknowledged there is some evidence football was played before 1992 and some forwards may have amassed many more goals before the Premier League existed. But still, Lukaku now stands only two goals behind Ian Wright (who admittedly was 28 at the start of the first Premier League season) and nine behind Steven Gerrard in the overall rankings. He is 25.There is something slightly unsettling about Lukaku. He is a player who seems to draw disproportionate criticism. There is something about him that feels unconvincing. His first touch occasionally seems heavy. His movement at times seems unimaginative. He is capable of missing fairly straightforward chances, as he did early on at Selhurst Park.But then he is also capable of executing finishes such as the two that brought his goals. Receiving the ball from Luke Shaw for the first, he let the ball run outside his right foot, which took him away from Martin Kelly but not near enough to James McArthur for the midfielder to make a block, while also giving him enough space to shape the ball round James Tomkins and into the bottom corner past Vicente Guaita, who was probably unsighted by the defenders. It was somehow both clinical and graceful.The second demonstrated great awareness even before the skill of the finish. As Victor Lindelöf’s header dropped, it would have been easy for Lukaku to come to the ball, to challenge Jeffrey Schlupp. Instead, he read the trajectory and let the ball drop over his shoulder, using his body to hold off Schlupp, and then had the athleticism and technique to get over the ball at the top of its bounce and hook it past Guaita.So what then, is the problem? Lukaku scores goals consistently, getting into double figures in the league in each of the past seven seasons, something all the more remarkable given only two have been spent with a “big six” side. He has a remarkable range of attributes, technical and physical. The issue, perhaps, is that he is not quite what he appears to be. The most striking thing about Lukaku is his size. He has the physique of a classic target man, and that allows him to do things that are impossible for others. And yet he is not a target man.He can play with his back to goal but it is not necessarily his preferred position. There were times under José Mourinho when he became isolated. Some players thrive on that. Salomón Rondón, for instance, the bulk of his international experience with Venezuela being not only as a lone forward but as a lonely forward, is adept at playing as far away from his teammates as possible, relishing the challenge of turning a loose ball into a free-kick or a throw-in.But that is not Lukaku. His best two performances in the past 12 months have probably both come on the right wing, for Belgium against Brazil in the World Cup quarter-finals and for United at Arsenal in the FA Cup. On neither occasion was he playing as an orthodox winger both times his job was essentially to stay high up the pitch behind an attacking left-back. On both occasions he was devastating on the counter. Lukaku may have a chest that seems to demand the ball be pinged into it but he is probably better with the ball played in front of him.There are those moments of occasional clumsiness. Perhaps they are the result of an occasional loss of concentration but such aberrations do seem to be a feature of big players in general, as though it is very difficult when bulk begins to go the wrong way to make the necessary adjustments.In target men, that might be forgiven, but there Lukaku falls victim of the underlying recognition that he is an all-round striker, simultaneously both target man and not target man so nobody knows quite what standards to apply. It is worth remembering, though, amid all the doubts, that the only player younger than him who has scored more Premier League goals is Harry Kane, who was born 10 weeks after Lukaku.He scores goals, is tactically adaptable, capable of technical excellence and happens to be big and strong as well. Perhaps he is not such an obvious part of Solskjær’s vision as the more mobile trio of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard but as a back-up and a more physical option, Lukaku still has plenty to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d3b007f215f8e3fc3f0274c06deeef44e4fee2/7_0_2175_1305/master/2175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b71a079c5e3acbb7666d01f9493f96a","title":"the most perfect camera angles of great football moments","story":"The perfect angle can enhance the most perfect moments in football, so which are the best?

But then something like this comes along, a perfect shot from a perfect angle of a perfect pass, and the rest of it just melts away for a little while.The perfect camera angle can certainly enhance a moment of brilliance, to give a moment we’ve all seen a thousand times something extra. Take John McGinn’s goal for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday earlier this season: it would have been pretty special if the only surviving record was via a bad courtroom artist, but this angle, perfectly capturing the power, technique and fade, makes it even more special. See also this shot of Benjamin Pavard’s goal against Argentina, Cuco Martina’s physics-defier against Arsenal and naturally there are plenty of that Roberto Carlos free-kick.What about this one of Georghe Hagi’s strike from downtown for Romania against Colombia in the 1994 World Cup? The angle from behind of Michael Essien’s thriker against Arsenal is especially enjoyable for one kid in the crowd flinching, convinced the ball was going to hit him, before it swerved round a corner and into the net. And on that theme, enjoy Ibrahima Sissoko’s effort for Monaco from this season. Or indeed Phil Coutinho versus Switzerland at the World Cup.Cameras seem to follow Tom Huddlestone’s best moments around perfectly, but a favourite is watching this one zoot through Rafa van der Vaart’s legs. Gio van Bronckhorst caught this one against Uruguay real nice, and so did the camera operator.The low angle shot of Ronaldinho’s debut strike for Barcelona captures the broiling excitement splendidly. This one of Aaron Ramsey scoring against Galatasaray is special not just because it catches the strike delightfully, but also Wojciech Szczęsny’s reaction to it. The reverse angle of Josimar in 1986 is always worth watching. Can a good angle enhance a penalty? You bet it can.And finally, let’s return to a goal, and the most perfect angle from one of the most perfect moments in World Cup history: gol di Grosso.Which ones have we missed?

These tournaments are key for building momentum and confidence, and for helping the coaches decide which 23 players will go to the World Cup.Phil Neville said before flying to the US that “the door is not shut on any player with ambitions of making the squad” but it’s certainly closing fast. By now I expect he will have a good idea of what his first-choice team will be, and most of the back-up players he is planning to take. Some of them, such as Seattle’s Jodie Taylor and Chelsea’s Fran Kirby, have not been playing regularly for their clubs, so it will be important to build their confidence on the international stage.England got a fantastic result in their first game against Brazil, winning 2-1 after going 1-0 down from a dubious penalty. The first-half performance was nervy and sloppy with lots of possession lost in defensive and midfield areas, but in the second half there was more urgency, and the midfield and forwards won the ball back higher up the pitch, leading to crossing opportunities which the Brazil goalkeeper struggled to deal with. This type of positive reaction will be needed in abundance during difficult matches at the World Cup. A second victory over Brazil in five months will also give England a massive morale boost, and the knowledge they can beat the other top teams, even when not at their best.England go into this World Cup with the pressure of expectation to win the tournament, which we didn’t have in 2015 in Canada. They will be among the favourites but, like in the men’s competition last year, there are a lot of teams who will travel with genuine title hopes. Gone are the days when you thought only Germany or USA could win it.There are half a dozen teams I think could lift the trophy, with USA, France, Japan, Australia, England and the Netherlands in with a good chance. Germany and Canada were among the six top seeds and could come through the pack but I wouldn’t put them among my favourites. Germany have changed manager since the 2017 European Championship but they limped through that tournament and I’m not convinced they have the cutting edge. John Herdman left Canada’s women’s team last year to become manager of their men’s side, and without his huge influence they remain in transition.I’m particularly intrigued to see how France get on. They have so much talent but though they won the SheBelieves Cup last year they never seem to get over the line in major tournaments. Psychologically they can be fragile, so it will be really interesting to see if home support strengthens them, or if they struggle with the additional pressure of being the host nation.Australia are ranked No 6 in the world but I think they’ve got a great chance. They have had to overcome some upheaval this year but they have a great squad, excellent fitness levels, are strong in defence and they have arguably the best striker in the world in Sam Kerr. I play with a lot of the Italian national team players at Juventus, and I’d love to see them do well, but with Australia and Brazil in their group it isn’t going to be easy for them.Once this week’s international competitions are over the players will go back to their clubs and focus on the conclusion to the league campaigns. The end of the season is in sight but it’s still far enough away that you can put the World Cup to the back of your mind. Once you get to the final weeks of the season, into April and May, that’s when the excitement really kicks in.There does come a time, in the final weeks before a big tournament, when you become conscious as a player of the need to avoid injury. As a forward it is always a bit easier to avoid the kind of challenges that can cause impact injuries. If you’re running through on goal, there are two months until the World Cup, it’s a 50‑50 ball and some crazy keeper’s coming out and is about to take your leg off, I think a forward who’s wise enough will protect themselves. We can be tackled but referees are there to police dangerous challenges. Forwards are protected by the laws of the game and the way it’s played, while defenders and midfielders have to throw themselves about a bit more.My own preparations for the World Cup are also in full swing. I’ve been out of the England team for three years, so I’m well adjusted to not being part of the squad, but I will be involved in a different way. My focus now is on another passion of mine: the media work.Having played in three World Cups I’ve had fabulous experiences and opportunities, and another has opened for me over the past three years – working at major international tournaments and being right in the heart of the action as a pundit. I will be preparing as seriously as if I was in the England team, watching the opposition, trying to identify strengths and weaknesses, the tactics and personalities. It will be my job to know all the stuff that people at home might not know. This week I will be watching everything I can, as the squads gather around the world. It will soon be summer, and the time is going to fly.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

It’s something anyone who cares about their financial future should consider.The old adage that investments can go down as well as up remains true, but investing makes sense for anyone keen to see a high rate of return over the long term. Yet a common misconception prevails that cash savings are safe, whereas investments are risky.That’s not true, according to Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment platform Willis Owen. He believes anyone looking to save money over a period of 10 years or more should seriously consider investments.“Cash savings aren’t what they once were, and don’t deliver over the long term because they offer interest rates below the rate of inflation. That means the spending power of your savings actually falls over time,” he says.“More than ever before, we need to invest for retirement.”Opening a cash Isa is one thing, but investing in stocks and shares can feel scary by comparison. Lowcock thinks we should see it as a natural progression, and says investing isn’t as risky as its reputation suggests.“If you’re investing for the long term, there are ways of building a portfolio that aren’t high-risk,” he says. “While there’ll be lots of volatility in the underlying investments over the long term, investments in stock markets generally go up over that time period.”With so many fund options out there, picking solutions for your own investment can be complex. Willis Owen has developed a virtual investment tool called Play, which enables users to become seasoned investors without parting with a penny. It replicates what happens on the stock market, so users can research funds and invest up to £10,000 of virtual money in a portfolio.“It’s like taking a car for a test drive before you buy” says Jason Chapman, managing director of Willis Owen. “With little or no investment experience, you can get to grips with everyday investment risks and opportunities, and experience everything from picking a sum and making an investment decision to handling the transaction and monitoring the portfolio.”A virtual investment tool helped Andrew Buchanan, 24, get to grips with investing in the US stock market. “I wanted to better understand what influenced the share price of the major blue-chip companies in the US, so my goal in using the tool was to test my theories on various pieces of financial news, without putting any capital at risk,” he says.“I’d read about various trading strategies, and the tool enabled me to put them to the test to see how they played out in practice. I also wanted to learn more about the metrics that were available, and I could see the sort of data people were using in the pits.”Virtual investment tools aren’t just for those who are new to investing, however. Seasoned investors can replicate their live portfolio and try out different investment strategies risk-free.Jacqueline Mitton has been investing in unit trusts for more than 30 years, managing her own portfolio for most of that time. Using Play allowed her to experiment with an investment strategy that she was too nervous to apply to her live portfolio.“In my live portfolio, my investment strategy has been rather cautious I’m not a risk taker by nature, and I didn’t imagine I’d invest in any of my Play funds in the real world,” she says. “But building on what I’ve learned, I’ve now decided to put aside a sum of money for investing more adventurously.”Owning your financial future can be a daunting prospect. But using investment products is as easy as any other money-related activity, be that transferring your balance to a new credit card or taking your lunch to work to save cash. A virtual investment tool can help users develop confidence – the lack of which holds many people back from investing.“There’s a conception that investing is complex, but the actual transaction can be done as easily as buying something from Amazon,” says Lowcock.Nonetheless, there’s a big difference between spending £5.99 on a book and putting £1,000 into an Isa. “Investing is a completely different feeling and experience it’s not a physical product and you don’t get next-day delivery on it. Play enables you to gain essential expertise and build confidence before taking that first step.”With a live investment portfolio, mistakes can be costly. With a virtual tool, you can apply valuable lessons learned to your live portfolio. “You will make mistakes as an investor, regardless of whether you’re new, very experienced or even a professional, but how you handle those mistakes is crucial to your success,” says Lowcock.“One of the biggest investing mistakes most people make is selling the moment their investments fall in value and the markets drop, but with a virtual portfolio you can afford to wait and watch it recover, because you’re not losing anything.”It’s no surprise that people put off decisions about investing, but Chapman recommends spending as much time planning for your retirement and financial future as you do planning your next holiday. You don’t need a meaningful sum of money to invest, either.“People worry that their investment could fall significantly in value, but that’s unlikely to happen if you’re well ersified, and you can start investing with as little as £25-£50 per month,” he says.“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket buy a range of funds to reduce the risk and ensure you’ve got exposure to other markets beyond the UK, where people are concerned about Brexit,” he advises.“If you’re not putting too much in up front then just enjoy the experience,” adds Lowcock. “And remember why you’re doing this – for your family’s future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae8b3ef382a033076d2f10cb06dd04266f21d64/2017_190_4262_2557/master/4262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=123c62c6ca7012e11defe065f7411778","title":"my dad was proud of me for organising my pension how one freelancer shored up her future","story":"For the self-employed, a pension can seem impossible – but it doesn’t have to beFreelance writer Rachel Spencer was 34 when she made the leap and set up her first pension – caving in after her financially savvy father badgered her to do it. “My dad was really amazing with money and he explained to me that that a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) was a great way of generating a lot of money if you put in a decent amount every year. Back then it was the glory days of journalism, so I put in about £500 a month for two to three years.” A decade later, Spencer is happy to have been swayed by her father. “I’ve made a decent amount of money through it so far, with £18,000 saved from putting in £12,000,” she says.Spencer, who lives in Newcastle with her partner and also runs a PR consultancy called Publicity for Pet Businesses, was attracted to the flexibility offered by a Sipp. “I didn’t want the commitment of putting into a pension forever,” she says. “I was earning good money at the time and thought rather than wasting it I would start plotting ahead for when I’m older. In my early 30s I was single and I didn’t have other big commitments – and I knew, as a freelancer, income can be hit and miss and you don’t know what’s round the corner. My dad died a few years ago, but I know he was proud of me for organising my pension.”Sipps put the customer in the driving seat, rather than leaving the pension provider to allocate your money to different funds. You decide when, where and how you invest your money, whether that’s in inidual stocks and shares and government and corporate bonds, or exchange-traded funds and commercial property.“A Sipp allows you to be in charge of the investment decisions,” explains Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen. “Previously, people didn’t have control over their pensions. Now you can choose where to invest, or you can delegate it to another party. You can be risky or cautious, or somewhere in between. At Willis Owen, we research funds, provide starter portfolios and offer help to anyone investing. We also offer a one-stop shop fund solution, where the manager is making decisions on your behalf to suit your appetite for risk.”Lowcock says Sipps provide more transparency than your typical pension. “Even if you’ve delegated it to someone else, you can still log in and see your investments 24 hours a day,” he says. “You can also move your investments around quite easily.”Organising a Sipp is straightforward: just apply online at the provider you choose and invest a minimum of £25. The whole process takes about 10-15 minutes, although Lowcock warns that if finances are tight and you’re already worried about making your mortgage repayments, you should think carefully before choosing a Sipp investments can go up or down.You can also press pause on your Sipp if those contributions are needed elsewhere. Spencer, now 43, bought her first house in Warrington when she was just 25, and invested in a property in Lymm in Cheshire with the profits. She has since bought a second property, in Newcastle. “I like the fact I can stop paying into it when I need to focus on other things in my life, but I will restart it again soon,” she says.Looking ahead, Spencer is set to be financially comfortable in her retirement. “I know I’ll have property income and a safety net from my pension.” But there won’t be any sitting on her laurels, as the pet-lover plans to set up a dog-friendly holiday home business.“I spend as much time as possible travelling and seeing different places with my dog, Patch, so I would love to be able to create my own weekend retreats for dogs and their owners,” she says. “I’ve always been a grafter and I can’t imagine doing nothing in my retirement, so creating amazing experiences for other crazy dog people like me would be ideal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c304e6fa18274d2bc5fe3c7c3568cd692af8ebb/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd907e73f186f5f81838579cdfdc6e4","title":"struggling to sleep share your experiences","story":"If you have problems sleeping at night we’d like to hear from you is planning a new video project about sleep.We’re hoping to understand more about how people are affected by sleep problems and would like readers to tell us how they navigate sleepless nights.We want to include first-person video testimony from our readers.

However, it was not clear whether sleeping more on the weekend could balance the books and prevent such an uptick.Now researchers say the signs are that it does not. Even if people have lie-ins at the weekend after a busy week, they found any benefits are transient, and that by the middle of another working week the body’s metabolism is just as disrupted, if not more so, than if they had not slept in. Writing in the journal Current Biology, Wright and colleagues described how they studied 36 participants who spent 13 nights in the laboratory, the first three nights getting about eight hours sleep.While eight people were allowed to continue with this pattern for the rest of the study, two groups of 14 people went on to have their sleep deprived, getting just under five hours a night. However, while one group was allowed to indulge in lie-ins and set their own bedtimes after four nights, those in the other group were not. After the weekend, both groups had a further two nights of sleep deprivation before being allowed to recover.The results revealed those who were allowed to lie in did, with men sleeping more than women and participants not rising until about noon on the Saturday. But the team said that, even in that case, the total number of hours slept did not make up for the number of hours lost earlier in the week.Moreover, by monitoring levels of the hormone melatonin, the team found participants’ internal body clocks were shifted to a greater extent when sleep deprivation was combined with lie-ins than if a sleep pattern was consistent.All participants went from a restricted diet to eating whatever they wanted after the first three nights – with all showing a similar uptick in calories consumed.While those who consistently had eight hours sleep a night showed no clear change in body weight at the end of the study, participants in the other two groups put on weight to similar degrees, gaining just under 1.5kg on average while they also developed a reduced sensitivity to insulin, a key hormone in regulating blood sugar levels. Further analysis suggested such effects could, at least in part, be down to participants in both groups snacking more after dinner on sleep-deprivation days, which the researchers say may disrupt metabolism in a number of ways. Research has previously suggested that, while consistently failing to get enough sleep can increase the risk of an early death, a weekend lie-in might counter the effect. But Wright said it is not just mortality, but staying healthy that matters.Others note that, while the latest study is small, it suggests lie-ins might not be enough to compensate for a working week of little slumber after all.Dr Stuart Peirson, an expert in sleep and circadian clocks from the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said: “You may live as long but this data, certainly in the short term, suggests there can be metabolic consequences.”But Peirson noted that the study did not take into account cognitive prowess, which he said might have benefited from some catch-up snoozing among the sleep deprived."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c50da4dda228a52fbe95d62ef36c8552ad87ebe/0_127_2313_1388/master/2313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4fd3484715a2a723c182855f8261fc4","title":"contribute podcast clothing fashion sustainable","story":"We’d love to hear your thoughts about the environmental and ethical impact of ‘fast fashion’, and how we as iniduals and nations can rethink attitudes to shoppingIn the next episode of our We Need to Talk About podcast, we’ll be exploring how an inidual can rethink their relationship to clothes and make easy choices towards sustainable shopping. We’ll be looking at the psychological cycles of buying, as well as the changes that need to come from government level. We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording. To share your questions, reflections and ideas with them, please email us at: weneedtotalkabout@… providing your question along with your name, age, and country of residence.The fashion industry is big business. In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e4346a540e85d5e653f3f70a3e118d0ddf29ca/0_250_5035_3021/master/5035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a08d5e9d7d85e0a3c344f40cdac37d2c","title":"thank you for soundtracking my life readers tributes to mark hollis","story":"You have been reacting to the news Mark Hollis, lead singer of Talk Talk, has died at the age of 64Spirit of Eden is simply brilliant and one of the top ten albums of all time for me. I worked at both EMI and PolyGram (where they later signed to Polydor) and remember being staggered at the ambition, scope and sound of the albums he delivered. In my opinion, way beyond anything anyone else was doing at the time. Today, on my way to do the shopping I will listen once again to the music of a man who I genuinely think was a genius.Anybody who has never experienced the album, please do yourself a favour and sit down and listen to it. It is not instant and needs working at to appreciate it. But what that is brilliant comes to you without hard work? It needs time and works in its entirety as it does not have a “hit” anywhere near it. It is not designed for, nor does it work in today’s Spotify or iTunes single track format, nor did it for radio andor MTV at the time. The compression that the internet gives does no justice to the atmosphere achieved on the original vinyl either. But I will guarantee that once it has got into you, it will be with you forever, like all good things will satisfy your soul. A genuine masterpiece. Leon DepopeIt’s funny how things affect you. It makes no difference functionally, since Mark Hollis disappeared from public life in 1998, and I certainly never met him, but I’m heartbroken.He said (and I’m very much paraphrasing here) that he’d done everything he set out to do with those later albums, Laughing Stock especially, and that’s why he slowed down and eventually stopped. I suppose because he was able to express himself so perfectly, to listen to those records is to know him intimately. I always loved who I heard in them. A sweet soul, and an awkward bastard. I still cry every time I listen to Laughing Stock after more than a decade of listening to it on average every few days.Even if I imagined the person I heard, It makes me so sad to know that he’s not around any more. So effortly blessed. Andrew SamoyedIf there’s such a thing as a vibration of the human spirit, Mark Hollis knew how to make music to match its timbre.What an amazing, profound, integrity filled man he was. With some musicians you always look at their careers and think what might have been. Well, there’s no such regrets here.Farewell Mark, you’ve given me more inspiration then any artist on this planet. jesusjuice89We’ve lost a great, singular talent. Together with his bandmates in Talk Talk he produced some of the most incredible music to have ever emerged from the UK. Talk Talk’s progression over five records is utterly ridiculous. Genius.Living in the Netherlands, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy, the essence of my Englishness. AnhagaTo this day I still listen in awe at what manifests forth and out of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock especially in the darkest hours of time and of the soul. I cannot put my finger on it but as I get immersed in all the storm, swirl and silence of the music all I ever experience is light and rapture. To me they are the most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to, and yet I can only listen to them alone, the experience is too personal and intense to share. They are the most spiritual musical experience I have ever had and I cannot begin to document how much of an impact they have had on me and my life. Thank you, Mark Hollis. thegreatdarginiI’m struggling on this one so unexpected. I always had this feeling he’d just emerge again one day, drop an album – no fuss, no build-up … and, of course, it would be perfect. Just like Laughing Stock, just like the solo album and, of course, just like Spirit of Eden. When most of the music from the end of the 20th century is long forgotten those albums will still be played, admired and loved.Thanks (along with Paul and Lee) for helping to soundtrack my life, Mark. Love to your friends and family. As the trees come into leaf over the next few weeks I’ll do what I always do at this time of year - play The Colour of Spring over and over again. Mitch44I first heard Spirit of Eden when I was a sixth-form student almost 30 years ago. I’d heard nothing like it in my life. I knew of the early New Romantic Talk Talk, and some pretty catchy songs, but this? It was just from a different world ... I must have listened to that album thousands of times since and it still gives me goosebumps. There is simply nothing much to compare it with – perhaps only Laughing Stock and Hollis’s wonderful solo album.Some say that Bark Psychosis are their nearest comparison. They’re good, but they’re not Talk Talk. And Hex is great, but it’s not Spirit of Eden. Nothing can top that ... I always held out a faint hope he’d break cover and give us something new to wonder over. Sadly, what was always likely is now certain. Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time. There will be goosebumps, all over again ... thanks Mark, you were a genius.

Her latest, Crushing, is a bold reclamationGrowing up in the Blue Mountains just outside Sydney, Julia Jacklin was as drawn to Top 40 pop artists of the early 2000s – think Britney and Avril – as she was to the Billy Bragg and Doris Day records in her parents’ record collection. Life in suburbia informed her 2016 debut, Don’t Let the Kids Win. She confessed, on this collection of coming-of-age songs that blended folk and country traditions and was held together by her measured yet otherworldly voice, to her fear of failing at this new, hopeful life as a musician.Failure never came to pass – the album drew comparisons with the likes of Angel Olsen and Sharon Van Etten and found success in the UK, a country long receptive to the charms of Australia’s finest shaggy songwriters. As she found her footing, Jacklin learned that success meant leaving behind everything that felt familiar. She is a relatively new transplant to Melbourne, where we meet. Eight months ago, she packed up her life in Sydney after realising, following years on the road, that her “sense of home was not in a city any more, it was in people”.“Lyrically, it’s quite a bit more basic than I used to write,” she says of her excellent new album, Crushing. “I always thought my second record would be really produced, like, ‘Watch out world, here I am!’ That’s how it always feels: that you’ve got to be a bigger, better version of yourself. But I was too tired to try to be anything more than I was.”Who she was changed suddenly and without warning. As an intense touring cycle wrapped up, her long-term relationship ended and she returned home to Sydney to find a city that “didn’t really look the same”. Her gut reaction was to retreat into her new normal: more touring, a transient life she’d come to rely on and resent in equal measure. “With touring, I felt like I was just this thing that was getting from A to B,” Jacklin says, the powerlessness of that reality manifesting in a resigned shrug. “I felt totally disconnected from my own thoughts and my own wants and needs.”Jacklin has spoken before of the early self-doubt that threatened to derail her potential, and how the process of performing her work on tour, to increasing crowds, reinforced the facts that she was deserving and legitimate. During the two years she spent on the road – “a really wonderful, turbo time of growth” – she also discovered that success in the music world was reliant on accepting its hazy parameters. “The social and business lines are just so murky,” she says. “Which I don’t love.”Being treated as an artist made her feel infantilised, and suspicious that industry associates who were “too nice” were withholding essential information in a misguided attempt to protect Jacklin from reality. “Sometimes you’ve got to just be this fun, social person who’s happy to go out to a million industry drinks. Sometimes I just want to know what the numbers and figures and facts are, so I can just do my job. It feels like people treat you like a toddler and they hide all the business stuff. I’m an adult who’s doing this for a living. This is my life. This is my livelihood. I want to know the ins and outs.”Jacklin says she has shared this experience with other female artists, who understand how “constantly working with men” can often mean that advocating for her own needs leads to being interpreted as demanding or distant. “At the beginning it feels like, if you aren’t really fun and entertaining, that they won’t sign you, and you might be ruining your chances,” she says. She found herself confronting the hurdle of being likable on the road as well, where she held back from asking for the space she needed – mentally, physically and emotionally – “because it just felt like that was too needy or whatever”.To survive playing songs about her emotions every night, she also had to hold those emotions at arm’s-length, which led to a period of deep disassociation. “It was a really intense time: incredible highs that you just can’t even believe, like playing your songs to thousands of people who have bought tickets to see you. But then also not seeing family and friends for months and months at a time, and trying to maintain the most composed, happy version of yourself in order to keep the whole thing going.”This disconnect made its way on to Crushing in the form of a recurring lyrical motif about her body. “I don’t want to be touched all the time  I raised my body up to be mine,” she sings – joyfully – on Head Alone. “If I’m in a relationship and also really busy, I just kind of give up the sense that this is my body and my life,” she explains.As she sits across from me describing the period in her life that inspired Crushing, it’s all very clearly in the past tense. She is confident and clear-eyed as she talks about entering this new phase of her career with “a much stronger sense of self”. Uniting the loose ends that were, for a long time, her body and mind – and connecting her ambitions to her newfound acceptance that she may not be thought of kindly for articulating what she wants – was obstacle-ridden but ultimately empowering. The result is a body of work that looks you in the eye, says what it means, and reflects every part of her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a560dffd9e5f30818eceea0960fac955c3bdebaf/0_121_5105_3062/master/5105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433dec13629644f11199c1906e5a06e3","title":"hard brexit tories a party within a party","story":"’s Dan Sabbagh and Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan explore whether the European Research Group is as influential as ever - or has it overplayed its hand on Brexit?

I’m totally proud that a little lowly backbench MP like me has been able to unite the House of Commons on this contentious Brexit issue over one of the least contentious subjects and bring the government to the dispatch box and vote in favour.”He added: “I’ll be writing to Donald Tusk seeking a meeting with a cross-party delegation from parliament to ask him to engage in a positive manner with the Council of Europe and ask him to give serious consideration to a unanimous mandate for the European commission to carve out part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens’ rights and have it as a special treaty in international law.”Campaign groups British in Europe and the3million in the UK who had met Costa just a few weeks ago to press their case said they were delighted with the amendment.In an extraordinary development on Wednesday Costa was forced to quit his job for speaking out but hours later won cross-party support for the amendment.Many now believe he should be reinstated as parliamentary private secretary to the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, but Costa says he doesn’t “give a stuff about being a junior aide” and if he had to resign over the rights of 5 million people “so be it”.Costa’s move seemed to hit quicksand after he tabled the amendment, with Theresa May indicating government disapproval. She told the house the EU had said ringfencing rights across the bloc was unworkable as they did not have “legal authority” to do so.After consulting Prof Stijn Smismans, professor of EU law at Cardiff University, Costa confirmed that the commission did not have the authority but that was to miss the point.Smismans, pointed out that the Council of Europe “can revise that mandate at any time. There is no legal hurdle at all”.As part of the plan Costa also wants the no-deal citizens’ treaty to have a transition period, as originally envisaged up to the end of 2021 at least.This would enable the resumption of negotiation on citizens’ rights that were omitted from the withdrawal agreement because they were due to be part of the second phase of Brexit negotiations on freedom of movement issues and the future relationship between the EU and the UK.This would be a boon for the estimated 1 million British nationals in Europe who, as it currently stands, will not be allow to work or offer a service in a second member state. It prevents, for example, British nationals who live in Germany or Belgium, entering Luxembourg to work, and prevents British nationals in Spain or Italy offering services ranging from accountancy to law to translation to do so from their home state."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35843ba020a412740de730e98f7ad4b704cc8319/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03118e701cc573720568e1e2e25af5fd","title":"extension article 50 must be one off brussels eu27 uk brexit delay","story":"Diplomats say EU27 hates idea of UK asking for further Brexit delay if first proves insufficientBrussels is to insist that any Brexit delay is a one-off, according to senior EU diplomats, setting the stage for Theresa May to present MPs with the choice of her deal or a chaotic no-deal exit this summer.The prime minister has suggested that she will seek a two-month extension if her deal is again voted down in the Commons in mid-March, to allow further time for negotiations.But EU27 heads of state and government are said by senior sources to hate the idea of the UK then asking for a further delay when the initial extension proves to be insufficient for renegotiations.It is understood that key member states are planning to put the European council president, Donald Tusk, under pressure to put into writing that the extension will not be repeated. “Some member states will insist on that being on paper,” said one diplomat.May is expected to put her deal to the Commons again on 12 March, and then seek an extension of article 50 if it fails to pass.EU diplomats say EU27 leaders will not want to discuss the length or terms of the delay when they meet for a European council summit on 21 March but merely sign off a mandated extension request made by May in the nine days after the vote.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he would only agree to an extension, which would require unanimity of the EU27 leaders, if there was a clear purpose to it.On Thursday, the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, in a joint press conference with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Vienna told reporters: “If this extension should take place it is also necessary to ask the question: what is the goal for the time frame, what good does this extension do? Does it ensure that we will be able to finish all the work? But if this is the way out to prevent a hard Brexit then we will support this path.”It is understood that May was told during recent discussions with Tusk and European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, that the Commons vote on 12 March, even if the meaningful vote is lost, should provide a clear path as to how the deal could be saved.“A short extension without a mandate, or something from Westminster, will be very difficult,” one EU diplomat said. “If Westminster is not able to say anything, I don’t think the European council will buy it. What the European council will try to avoid is a discussion at the European council.A 21-month extension, delaying Brexit to 2021, is being pushed by some senior EU officials and diplomats to allow plans for the future relationship to develop, and for there even to be a change of personnel in Downing Street.But there is resistance among member states who fear the EU will be blamed for trapping the UK in the bloc. “It is like playing the kingmaker, it isn’t sensible to intervene in domestic politics like that,” said one sceptic of the idea.A delegation of Dutch MPs, who recently visited Westminster to examine the most probable outcome of the Brexit impasse, have reported to their parliament that a no-deal scenario know appeared “likely”. They warn that British MPs were “unable to reach agreement let alone make a proposal” to unlock the talks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbce5d0a24f3a2bd471b82ea9d00c9637f2c40c6/0_96_3751_2251/master/3751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8e91782c08b89c10595182df26f132b","title":"john mcdonnell amendment second brexit referendum could happen next week","story":"Labour to push for another vote if May’s Brexit deal fails, shadow chancellor confirmsLabour will vote for a second referendum on Brexit when Theresa May tries to get her deal through parliament in the next fortnight, John McDonnell has said.The shadow chancellor said the Labour leadership would either support or put forward an amendment calling for a public vote when MPs are asked to back the government’s withdrawal agreement, which is likely to take place on 12 March.Speaking on ITV’s Peston on Wednesday night, he said Labour was looking to push for another referendum at the earliest opportunity.He said: “When the meaningful vote comes back – and we are told maybe that might be on 12 March – there are rumours today that it could be next week … That’s the time when we will have to put the amendment up.”McDonnell stressed that Jeremy Corbyn’s party would also continue to press for its own Brexit vision and was still calling for a general election.The chances of a second Brexit referendum have increased significantly since Labour said it would support calls for a public vote.Labour sources said Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was now consulting widely across the parliamentary party to find a form of words that could command majority support.Some senior members of the party are reluctant to back a second referendum if it entails giving any support to May’s withdrawal deal, so work is being done on how to avoid this outcome.The vote could be tight because up to 10 Conservative MPs back a second referendum, while about 20 Labour MPs with leave-voting seats are resisting that prospect. However, the numbers are shifting and more Tories could add their support to the people’s vote campaign.Labour’s Brexit blueprint was defeated by 323 votes to 240 in the Commons on Wednesday night and Corbyn confirmed Labour would now back a referendum if faced with a “damaging Tory Brexit” or a no-deal departure from the European Union. But he insisted that Labour would also continue to support “other available options” to prevent either the prime minister’s deal or the UK crashing out without an agreement.On ITV’s Peston, the shadow chancellor set out Labour’s approach, saying the move would be made when May next risks a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal. “That’s the time when we will have to put the amendment up,” he said.The party was willing to do what it can to ensure that the consequences of a no-deal Brexit were avoided, he added: “We have argued in our manifesto that we’ll respect the referendum but that we would not allow Theresa May to inflict upon us a reckless Brexit deal … That would be catastrophic for our economy.”He dismissed Peston’s claims that there were slim chances of passing the amendment, arguing that MPs were worried about jobs and would consider voting alongside Labour.McDonnell said: “There is a chance we could win it, and I’ll tell you why. People are worried about their constituencies, they’re worried about jobs, they are worried about the economy.” He added: “Either a deal will go through which will protect jobs and the economy or, to get some deal through, it will be conditional on going back to the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d416c05ea4c30f18c1414bed40e0140fa62ed15/0_0_1555_933/master/1555.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e55c30425b646e44a81305b48bce77c2 440w","title":"junior minister george eustice resigns over article 50 vote","story":"Minister resigns in protest against Theresa May agreeing to possible Brexit delayAgriculture minister George Eustice has resigned from the government over Theresa May’s decision to allow a vote on delaying article 50, saying it would be “the final humiliation of our country”.Eustice, a long-standing Brexiter and former Ukip candidate, said he wanted to be free to participate in debates in parliament in the coming weeks, saying he resigned with “tremendous sadness”.The ex-minister said he would vote for May’s withdrawal agreement but said he felt he had “stuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats”.Eustice said he felt the prime minister had been “terribly undermined” by ministers and MPs who did not want the referendum result to be carried out.“I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,” he said in his resignation letter. Though he said the prime minister had shown “tenacity and resilience”, he suggested both the prime minister and parliament had lost its nerve. “What our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it,” he said.Eustice, the MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, also criticised the conduct of the Brussels negotiators. “I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations,” he said.“They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave.“If the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.”Eustice said that MPs should be prepared to vote to leave with no deal and “have the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards”.A former farmer, Eustice stood for Ukip in 1999 and worked on the no campaign against the euro but then worked for the Conservative party under Michael Howard, eventually becoming press secretary to David Cameron when he was leader of the opposition.In his letter to the prime minister said that he would “do what I can from the backbenches to try to salvage this sorry situation and I hope that, when the moment comes, parliament will not let our country down”.May announced on Tuesday for the first time that she would give MPs a vote on seeking an extension to the article 50 process if the House of Commons failed to pass her Brexit deal on 12 March. First MPs will be given a vote on 13 March on whether to leave the EU without a deal, followed by one the next day on whether ministers should seek an extension.The announcement led to a revolt in parliament on Wednesday night by Conservative Eurosceptics, 20 of whom voted against an amendment setting out the schedule of votes, with more than 80 abstaining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98258a5a93a8cc061755365b24ba27306250b5de/0_17_1371_823/master/1371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c9dd472815b926ab6b3c9f63feed1b6","title":"brexit latest news developments mcdonnell says theres chance labour could win vote for second referendum politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenHere is Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the resignation of his junior minister and fellow Brexiter George Eustice.Here is Theresa May’s response to George Eustice’s resignation letter. By the standard of these things, it is warm and complimentary. The Russell Group is calling on Sajid Javid to scrap plans for a 36-month visa for EU nationals coming to the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit because it discriminates against Scottish universities, which offer four year degrees.Describing the plans, which would also penalise future EU students wanting to study engineering or medicine courses, which also last longer than three years, as “a kick in the teeth” for Scottish universities, the Russell Group head of policy Jess Cole said: Introducing a non-extendable, three-year visa for EU nationals would be bizarre. It’s a kick in the teeth to Scottish universities, given nearly every undergraduate course in Scotland is four years, and to courses such as medicine and engineering, which are also longer. This makes no sense for the NHS and industry, given the doctors and engineers we need.This policy actively discriminates against Scottish universities as our undergraduate degrees are typically four years in length. This is an oversight by the UK government but one which will inflict disproportionate damage to our institutions and must be rectified as a matter of urgency.It’s not quite the Jarrow March, although it follows a similar route – next month a group of pro-Brexit protesters , led by Nigel Farage, are due to stage a walk from Sunderland to London to “voice their deep disappointment at the ongoing betrayal of the referendum result”.The event is being organised by Leave Means Leave, whose founder and chair, Richard Tice and John Longworth, will be among the planned “core group” of marchers who will trek the entire 270 or so miles.Farage, the former Ukip leader who is setting up a new pro-Brexit party, will be there for the start – Sunderland was chosen as the first city to record a vote for leave in 2016 – and on yet-to-be-confirmed other legs to be fitted round his “pre-existing commitments”, a spokesman for Leave Means Leave said.The march will end with a rally in Parliament Square on 29 March, the planned Brexit date, though of course it might end up not being then.In a quote released by the organisers, Farage said:The Westminster elite are in the process of betraying the British people over Brexit. All of us who want Britain to be a great country once again accept that we must be prepared to stand up for what we believe in and fight for our independence.The European commission has rejected the UK parliament’s call for a mini deal guaranteeing citizens’ rights in the event of the withdrawal agreement being rejected. Last night the Commons approved without opposition the amendment tabled by the Tory MP Alberto Costa saying the government should ask the EU “to adopt part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens’ rights ... whatever the outcome of negotiations on other aspects of the withdrawal agreement.” The government originally opposed the amendment, on the grounds that the EU would never agree, although it changed its mind yesterday hours ahead of the vote.And today we’ve discovered that Theresa May’s initial assessment was right according to the EU, the Costa plan is a non-starter. This is what the European commission’s spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a Brussels briefing when asked if the EU was willing to strike a deal of the kind proposed by Costa. She replied:We will not negotiate mini-deals because negotiating such mini-deals outside the withdrawal agreement would imply that the negotiations have failed.Andreeva said that the best way to protect the continuing rights of expat citizens was “through the withdrawal agreement”. Last night most Tory MPs voted alongside the opposition to back an amendment approving Theresa May’s decision to allow the Commons a possible vote on extending article 50. Dozens of Conservatives abstained, but only 20 voted against. They were all hardline Brexiters, but they were small in number, and they lost the vote by a majority of almost 500. The rebellion seemed contained.But George Eustice’s resignation shows that it is not just the Brexiter ultras who are furious about the prospect of article 50 being extended. He is one of the Brexiter pragmatists - in his letter he says that he accepts the need for compromise, and will vote for Theresa May’s deal - but felt strongly enough about this to leave government.Here are some of the main points from his letter. (See 2.47pm.)We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of “no deal” the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window.Now if there is a no deal there is no more discussion. There is no more negotiation. It is over and each side will take its own unilateral contingency measures, and we will take them in such areas as aviation, but this does not mean mini-deals in the case of a no deal. We want a deal. We want an overall agreement otherwise each will take their own contingency measures on their own side. I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on George Eustice’s resignation.To make sense of George Eustice’s resignation, it helps to know that, although he is not the most vocal of the Brexiters in government, he is probably the only one who once stood as a Ukip candidate. That was back in 1999, when he failed to get elected as an MP. He subsequently joined the Conservatives, working for David Cameron as his press secretary when Cameron was opposition leader, before being elected MP for Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall in 2010.Here is the full text of George Eustice’s resignation letter. Here is his resignation letter in full.It is with tremendous sadness that I have decided to resign from the government following the decision this week to allow the postponement of our exit from the EU. Since parliament is now in direct control of events, I want to be free to participate in the critical debate that will take place in the weeks ahead.It has been an honour to work alongside so many talented iniduals at Defra over the past five years. Defra has phenomenal expertise and, more than any other government department, has embraced the opportunities posed by our exit from the EU. I have particularly welcomed the chance to craft two new Bills on farming and fisheries, which are the first for half a century, as we have prepared the ground to restore self-government in this country.I will vote for your withdrawal agreement when it returns to the House and I very much hope that the attorney general succeeds in securing final changes so that others might too. Although I campaigned to leave, I have always supported compromise to achieve a reconciliation in our country. Leaving the EU would represent an historic change and it is natural that some people will feel apprehensive. I have been open to the idea of using our existing membership of the EEA as an exit mechanism and I supported your approach outlined at Chequers when others did not. I have stuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats. However, I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country.I appreciate that you have been terribly undermined by those in parliament who refuse to respect the referendum result. You have shown tenacity and resilience over the past year. However, what our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it.As a Defra Minister, I have enjoyed good relations with the European commission and with ministers from other member states. However, I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of Parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.We must therefore have the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of “no deal” the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window.I will do what I can from the back benches to try to salvage this sorry situation and I hope that, when the moment comes, Parliament will not let our country down.George Eustice, the Brexiter fisheries minister, has just announced his resignation from the government. He says he is opposed to Theresa May’s decision to allow MPs a vote on extending article 50.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, has moved to quell concerns in Ireland after reports that Britain wanted to start a “beef trade war”.Downing Street said there was still no firm date for the publication of the schedule of tariffs which was due last week. Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, told the Irish parliament that Lidington rang him to tell him he was concerned about the reports over beef wars and “made it clear to me that they were not coming from the British government”.Coveney told MPs in the Dail there were “elements within the Westminster system that are frustrated that they cannot get over this issue of the backstop and want to see some pressure being applied to Ireland.”Government briefings to food sector interests suggest that while tariffs threaten price rises, quotas will be used to counter that in areas such as beef where Britain relies on imports. This would mean little or no price rises on foods like beef and dairy imports. The advisory group also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the UK government’s proposed salary threshold, under which people earning less than £30,000 would not be allowed admittance to the UK.So there is a communications campaign, but of course citizens and businesses are aware of that but they also look at the front pages and the news bulletins and they make a judgment, their own judgments, about the likelihood of no deal on 29 March. And here is some more reaction to the immigration figures. (See 11.06am.)From Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretaryThe data simply confirms the fakery behind the government’s immigration policy. Once again the number of migrants coming here vastly outstrips its unworkable 100,000 net migration target.From Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of OxfordThe overall story the data tell on EU migration is clear - Britain is not as attractive to EU migrants as it was a couple of years ago. EU net migration happened to be unusually high in the run-up to the referendum so at least some of this decline would probably have happened anyway even without Brexit.From Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: It is a real concern that non-EU net migration has risen still further to more than a quarter of a million even before the government has implemented its proposals to loosen the work permit system.These are from the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge in Brussels.Here is some reaction to the migration figures out this morning, showing a sharp fall in net migration from the EU since the referendum, but an increase in net migration from outside the EU. (See 11.06am.)From Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesmanHospitals, schools and social care providers are already struggling to hire the staff they need, and Brexit is making that problem so much worse.Even before we’ve left the EU, the chaos created by Tory ministers and the nasty rhetoric of Brexiters is putting off the EU workers that our public services badly need.From Matthew Fell, the CBI’s chief UK policy directorThese figures confirm fewer EU workers are coming to the UK, exacerbating labour and skills shortages across many sectors, from farm labourers to engineers.Businesses cannot succeed without access skills and labour, which is why it’s so important the government delivers a post-Brexit immigration system which is both open and controlled.From Tej Parikh, an economist at the Institute of DirectorsWith job vacancies at record highs, recruiting from abroad has never been more crucial for British businesses. Flexible and hassle-free access to international skillsets is part and parcel of having a globally competitive skills regime, so adjusting to the government’s post-Brexit immigration agenda, with its new restrictions, will present some challenges. Already, firms across the retail, hospitality and construction sectors are facing obstacles as some EU workers are returning home, while it’s also becoming harder to attract labour from Europe amidst the uncertain political climate.From Stephen Clarke, an economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktankWhile UK politicians are seemingly unable to provide any clarity on where Britain is heading post-Brexit, EU migrants are increasingly doing so – by leaving.EU migration is now at its lowest level in a decade – a fall that is being driven by fewer EU migrants coming to the UK for work. In contrast, migration from the rest of the world is close to a record high, though many of these migrants are coming to study rather than work.Post-Brexit Britain’s migration system is still to be decided, and is years away from coming into effect. But many areas of the labour market – particularly firms in high-turnover sectors like hospitality who are reliant on the free movement of EU workers – are going to have to adjust to lower migration well before the new system is in place.From Prof Jonathan Portes, a fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, an academic networkToday’s migration statistics show a continued fall in EU migration – indeed, comparing today’s data with the most recent labour force statistics, it is very likely that more Europeans are now leaving the UK than are arriving. This undoubtedly reflects the impact of Brexit on the attractiveness of the UK to other Europeans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22aa2951b6d24e94156bc39f357fa977d2821a2/407_1122_4968_2980/master/4968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be9d23f673dec88a511377ff0fac5ea2","title":"nanjing review royal exchange manchester jude christian","story":"Royal Exchange, ManchesterJude Christian’s solo show confronts historical brutality and personal heritage by dwelling in the grey areasIt’s hard to pin down Nanjing, Jude Christian’s elusive new solo show.

Brutal, indeed, feels like too mild a word for the atrocities Christian describes. But this is no simple telling of a history that remains relatively unknown in the UK. The narrative of Nanjing is complicated by Christian, revealing the tangled threads that tie it to other human-made horrors.Though better known as a director, Christian is a delicate and thoughtful writer, deftly handling the moral complexity of her material. She asks us what we would die for, what we would kill for, what we would forgive.Nanjing is a show that dwells in the grey, avoiding extremes of black and white while recognising the appeal of absolutes.If it sounds like a detached academic exercise, Elayce Ismail’s production is far from it. The show has a quiet, measured sense of ritual, building a meditative but haunting mood. A large white sheet becomes shroud, dress and billowing mushroom cloud, while carefully placed rocks both mark and mourn the lives Christian remembers. At the end, as she sets down the final stone, her central question lingers: how far would you go to fight for peace?

Can this be done with basic tech knowledge and zero experience of web design or coding? There’s a bewildering number of services offering to host websites, sell domain names, provide easy-to-use templates and so on at a range of prices. What are the catches with the free or cheap services on offer?We have a Facebook group but nobody in the association is very keen to keep this active. RobinIt’s a pity you don’t like the idea of using Facebook because this is generally the quickest and easiest way for a small group to get online. In fact, if an organisation has a physical manifestation – a school, park or church, allotments, a restaurant or so on – then it may already have a Facebook page. If so, you can apply to take it over. If that fails, you can start your own page and compete with it.Using Facebook has advantages: it’s free, you don’t need to do any programming and it’s likely most of your users will already have accounts. Facebook pages are also easily accessible to members’ spouses, children and relatives who wouldn’t visit a website.Facebook groups are different from Facebook pages. Facebook groups are more like chatrooms, and you can keep them private if you like. You could use a Facebook page for news and a private Facebook group to publish minutes and debate issues, among other things.When the web took off back in the 1990s, it was like the opening of America’s midwest, and millions of people went “digital homesteading” on sites such as GeoCities. Building websites with HTML turned out to require more effort, and more taste, than most people possessed. There were lots of good sites but most were dire.In the early 2000s, homesteading was replaced by blogging, which didn’t require any programming skills. Templates removed the need for design skills, or even taste. Although the basic diary structure of a blog didn’t suit every purpose, the free WordPress software made most things possible, for those who were willing to make the effort … or pay someone to put their website together.After the blogging boom, we saw the rise of the drag-and-drop website builder, which is where we are today. Drag-and-drop systems let you build websites quickly and easily by plonking pre-written components onto your developing webpage, with no programming required.If you’re rejecting Facebook, it comes down to a choice between WordPress and a drag-and-drop system. If you think you might be willing to give WordPress a go, read one of the dozens of online guides, such as How to Start a WordPress Blog the Right Way in 7 Easy Steps (2019). There’s a companion half-hour YouTube video.There are more than a dozen drag-and-drop website builders, and they all work in pretty much the same way with modules you just drop into place. They make it reasonably easy to update your website or transform it just by switching to a different template.Many drag-and-drop website builders come with some sort of hosting arrangement and a website address, so you don’t need to take out a domain name in advance. Of course, many domain name sellers and hosting providers use drag-and-drop website builders to attract people to buy domain names and sign up for web hosting packages. GoDaddy is a well-known example.Sites built with drag-and-drop website builders should now be “mobile friendly”, adapting to work on smartphones not just in PC web browsers. This is something to check.But there are some drawbacks. The main one is that drag-and-drop websites can be very hard to customise, and you mess with template code at your peril. Second, not every website builder will have all the options you need, so, without expensive customisation, it may be impossible to do what you want. Third, your website may look exactly like hundreds of other websites, and some people will instantly spot common templates. This might not bother you but it looks bad on a commercial website.Fourth, your website may be locked to the fortunes of the drag-and-drop software supplier or web host. You’re at their mercy if they have technical problems, if response times drop, or your traffic explodes. You might not be able to move your website to a host with a different website builder and end up having to rebuild the whole thing from scratch.Not all web hosting services come with unlimited bandwidth, and the free limit could be as low as 2GB. Find out what the limit is, and what happens if you exceed it.A local site might not expect to get more than a few hundred visits per month, and if your page is small – 500,000 or less – then you probably won’t have to worry about bandwidth charges. However, there’s always the risk of something going viral. A post with a photo of a cute kid with a puppy, or whatever, shared on social media, could get thousands or even millions of hits.It’s better to have your website go offline when it reaches a bandwidth limit than be faced with a huge bill.Three independent drag-and-drop website builders currently stand out from the crowd – Wix, Weebly and Squarespace – and there are lots of comparison reviews online.All three allow you to create a free test site so you can find out how well they work, and both Wix and Weebly will let you publish it. The main drawbacks are that you can’t use your own domain name, and that they will put their advert on your site. There may be storage and bandwidth limitations as well.Wix and Weebly are happy to host free personal sites because the failures cost nothing and the successful users will eventually move up to a paid plan. Squarespace doesn’t want free users: it targets commercial users, from creative freelancers and small businesses to large organisations.Wix’s paid plans start at £3 per month with 500MB of storage and 1GB of bandwidth, but the “best buy” offers 10GB of storage and unlimited bandwidth for £8.50 a month. The latter includes a free domain name for the first year.You should try all three to see which you like best, but I suspect you won’t want to pay Squarespace’s prices. Otherwise, a free Weebly account – which has unlimited bandwidth – looks like the best bet, if all your content fits into 500MB.Have you got a question?

Moments earlier, a rock the size of my head had come crashing down. Myself and my fellow climbers shouted at the top of our voices and watched with relief as it came thudding to a halt a couple of hundred metres beneath us. No one was hurt.And, truth be told, it was all my fault. I have only been climbing for little more than a year, and I’d been abseiling down an adjacent face in Rockaway Gully, Tasmania, when I dislodged the rock with my foot. I’d been hoping to get a better shot of my guide John Fischer, who was about to give our climbing trip another dramatic twist. But we’ll get to that later.I’d come to Hobart principally for the Australian Wooden Boat Festival, an event held every two years to celebrate all types of sailing vessels, from tall ships and dinghies to canoes and kayaks. The docks of the old whaling port were awash with masts and sails, and sunburnt sailors littered the harbour.I’d rowed into town with a crew of Scots and Tasmanians aboard a traditional five-oared St Ayles skiff. We’d been part of a 10-day small sailing and rowing boat expedition from Recherche Bay in far south Tasmania to the boat festival, a distance of 100 nautical miles. By the time we arrived, we all poured into the historic Hope and Anchor Tavern on Macquarie Street to down a few well-earned ales amid the cutlasses, hagbuts and harpoons that decorate the walls, and lead the raucous mob in rowdy sea shanties.From there, we dragged ourselves down Liverpool Street to crash at the comfortably crummy Pickled Frog Backpackers hostel, which boasts that, over the years, it’s “hosted sailors, whalers, smugglers, gold-diggers, daredevils and wanderers” (12-bed dorms from Aus$26£14 a night). The following morning, I surveyed the litter of casualties curled up on the worn sofas of the lounge, and began to think about my other purpose in visiting Hobart: climbing.Mount Wellington is 20 minutes from Hobart, and has 400 climbing routes tucked in the rock formations beneath its summit. One of them is a circuit called the Organ Pipes, where the dolerite rock is similar to basalt: columnar with “splitter cracks” and as grippy as rough sandpaper.My guide was tousle-haired John Fischer, aka Crazy John, an American immigrant to Tasmania, who in 2015 made Isle of Rock, the first film about rock climbing on the island. We were going to climb Fiddlesticks on Flange Buttress, a medium grade 60m gem of a climb, executed in two pitches. I gracefully declined John’s offer to lead and instead followed his fluid and skilful upward motion, playing out rope. John also offers non-climbers an abseiling-only option opening up the roped experience to all, regardless of ability.By the time we were halfway up, the clouds were parting, the sun was flashing a smile and the views down the Derwent and across to Bruny Island were stunning. “It is one of the better routes of its grade in the whole country,” John said. The hard bits are not too hard, the rock is extremely grippy and all I had to do was trust in the rubber of my climbing shoes. After a celebratory chat at the top, we abseiled back down to our packs.John has a touch of the “dirtbag” about him. And that is not at all pejorative. American climber Fred “Dirtbag” Beckey (14 January 1923 – 30 October 2017) slept in cars, ate junk food, eschewed patronage and just lived to climb, claiming hundreds of first ascents. “Will belay for food” read his cardboard hitchhiking sign. John had not brought any lunch and had asked fellow climber David Tan to meet him at the summit with a cheeseburger from the urban valley below. It was eagerly anticipated, yet when David arrived he had brought no such luxuries. Instead, he rummaged around in his van like an ibis, a bird unaffectionately nicknamed the “bin-chicken”, to find a curried veggie pie – only a bit past its “sell by date” – and proffered it as an apology.By the afternoon, John and David were scaling Albert’s Tomb, a 10-metre needle of rock which is extremely difficult to climb.They were vying with some real life bin-chickens for a perch atop the narrow column. But John’s aim was more ambitious: to jump to the adjacent cliff-face and back, a feat he had performed years earlier. I was watching from on a nearby face, peering anxiously through my camera. David was egging him on from below.Suddenly, John sprang forward and, somehow, his palms stuck to the coarse cliff opposite.He climbed a little higher and then dropped like a hawk back on to the table top of the plinth. I exhaled and took my finger off the shutter button."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aec3bdd101d90ce7019506f069eb76e9c8129fd/0_4_1461_877/master/1461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff9d880efe09bc362e7e8b015b7ec6bc","title":"fbi finds 2000 human bones indiana home ","story":"Bones were found to be a part of a collection of over 40,000 artifacts in the home of Don Miller, an artifacts collectorThe FBI has discovered about 2,000 human bones at the home of an extreme artifacts collector in rural Indiana.The bones were found to be a part of a collection of over 40,000 artifacts in the home of Don Miller, a second world war veteran and former electrical engineer, CBS reported on Tuesday.The FBI started investigating Miller’s home in 2014 after the agency determined he may have illegally obtained items in his collection, potentially violating local and federal laws. Miller, who died in 2015 at the age of 91, was never charged with a crime for his artifacts.“When I first went into his house and saw the size of the collection, it was unlike anything we’d ever seen,” Tim Carpenter, head of the FBI’s art crime unit, told CBS.In recollections of his life told to the Indianapolis Star, friends and co-workers detailed Miller’s stories of traveling the world, doing missionary work and going on amateur archaeology expeditions. Miller told CBS in 2014 that he had traveled to 200 countries to collect artifacts.Miller displayed his finds at his house, inviting people to tour his collection as if they were visiting a museum. In a tour given to the Indianapolis Star in 1998, the paper reported Miller having bullets from civil war battlegrounds, a canoe from the Amazon river and two eggs “believe to have been laid by dinosaurs in China”, according to the paperThe FBI determined that half of Miller’s collection was Native American artifacts. Almost all the human remains are believed to be from Native American burial sites.Native American burial sites are protected under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which gives Native Americans the right to determine what to do with artifacts found in burial sites. Archaeological digs of burial sites must also receive approval under the statute.Though prohibited by various state and federal laws, stealing items, including human remains, from Native American burial sites is not completely uncommon in the United States. Three men in Ohio were sentenced in 2016 for illegally selling Native American human remains, while a fourth was charged for purchasing the remains.“Unfortunately, there is somewhat of a market, not necessarily for the human remains themselves, but oftentimes what’s buried with them,” Francis McManamon, founding director of the Center for Digital Antiquity at Arizona State University and former chief archaeologist for the National Park Service, told the . “Pottery, jewelry, other kinds of art objects that people will pay a lot of money for.”Since the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act was passed in 1990, the federal government has regularly prosecuted those who illegally obtain Native American artifacts, McManamon said. In 2009, the federal government indicted 24 people in its largest sting operation to crack down on illegal artifact collecting. The FBI focused the operation on 256 Native American artifacts that it valued at $335,685.It is unclear whether the FBI has determined that Miller violated the act. The sheer size of his collection may make it impossible to determine exactly what crimes were committed, according to the Indianapolis Star.The FBI told the  in a statement that “efforts to identify and return the artifacts is ongoing”.Pete Coffey, an Arikara tribal official in North Dakota, is working with the FBI to bring remains found in Miller’s home back to the tribe.“All too often here we have been treated as curiosities rather than a people,” Coffey told CBS, noting the remains could very well belong to a relative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3f9bd24a087dba328c43d1a958765d05db8a958/0_97_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ee12b1d1f53cb13514b5916a937a5db","title":"mark meadows obama kenya birther republican","story":"A prominent Republican congressman who this week furiously denied being racist has falsely suggested at least twice that Barack Obama was born in Africa.Mark Meadows promised supporters during the 2012 election campaign that he and Republican colleagues would send Obama home “to Kenya or wherever”.Meadows, of North Carolina, grew emotional and red-faced on Wednesday when he was accused of carrying out a racist stunt during a congressional hearing.He had tried to counter allegations made by Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former legal fixer, that Trump was racist by bringing Lynne Patton, a black Trump administration official and Trump family friend, with him to the hearing. Patton has said she does not believe Trump is racist.Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic congresswoman from Michigan, said later in the hearing that using a black woman as “a prop” was “racist in itself”. Meadows angrily demanded Tlaib withdraw the remark and said he had black relatives and friends. Tlaib said she did not accuse Meadows himself of being racist.Following the clash, video footage recorded during the 2012 campaign was unearthed in which Meadows dabbled with the racist “birther” conspiracy theory pushed for years by Trump and other Republicans.Proponents of the theory falsely alleged that Obama, who was born in the US state of Hawaii, was born in Africa and therefore ineligible for the presidency.During a forum held by the Blue Ridge Tea Party Patriots conservative group on 12 June 2012, Meadows and fellow Republican candidate Vance Patterson were asked if they would investigate Obama’s birthplace.“Yes,” Meadows responded. He went on to say: “If we do our job from a grassroots perspective, we won’t have to worry about it. We’ll send him back home to Kenya or wherever it is. We’ll send him back home.”Steve Morris, of the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, on Wednesday published a recording of Meadows standing in front of a “Tea Party Express” bus at an event on 9 June 2012.“What we’re going to do is take back our country,” Meadows said. “2012 is the time that we’re going to send Mr Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is. We’re gonna do it.”In an interview with Roll Call in 2012, Meadows said he had used a “poor choice of words” and acknowledged that Obama was an American citizen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7349cf8f4fc6892ca268e97f81526d2346c512/0_205_3382_2029/master/3382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b1690642c964273a8bc35344a78770","title":"theresa may backs ally jordan king abdullah underwrites world bank loan","story":"Prime minister in diplomatic push with King Abdullah II at major London conferenceBritain launched an economic and diplomatic push to protect Jordan as an oasis of political stability in the Middle East by staging a conference designed to rescue the debt-ridden country, and help its leader, mainly by an injection of private sector investment.The crowded London conference was attended by Jordan’s King Abdullah II, the British prime minister, Theresa May, the bulk of the Jordanian cabinet, the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and a host of economic experts.Jordan has faced summer street protests directed at the severity of its six-year economic consolidation programme. Sporadic protests over tax rises are continuing, showing the government’s limited room for manoeuvre.The IMF-backed programme has been described as the most draconian anywhere in the world since the financial crash, dwarfing the cutbacks in public spending seen even in Portugal, and broadly matching those in Greece. The aim of the conference was to showcase Jordan’s potential as a country in which to invest rather than raise aid.At one point, the summer riots in its capital, Amman, led to unfounded rumours that the king might abdicate amid signs that members of the Jordanian royal family were circling to succeed him.Jordan, although touted as a source of political stability in an unstable region, is on its seventh prime minister since 2011, with critics claiming the king uses his ministers as a lightning rod for his own unpopular policies.The current prime minister, Omar al-Razzaz, appointed after the street protests and a former World Bank economist, insists Jordan’s economy is showing signs of an upturn, but the fear is that if the fiscal consolidation is not accompanied by export-led growth and private sector investment, sizeable street protests will recommence.Many of the country’s most skilled workers have left for Saudi Arabia or increasingly Turkey. But Saudi Arabia is also trying to address its unemployment issues by substituting indigenous labour in jobs previously done by migrants. The London conference heard that for every 100 Jordanian managers working in Jordan, 80 are currently working in Saudi Arabia.A further exodus is likely to occur if Jordan cannot change the structure of its economy. Educated women are pouring out of Jordan’s universities but are unlikely to be accommodated in the current public sector structures.Economic planners have attempted to highlight what they say are Jordan’s strengths: a skilled young workforce, strength in services, access to markets and commitment to green energy.King Abdullah told the conference “the world understands the importance of a strong and prosperous Jordan”, insisting the country has the resilience to withstand the turmoil in the region. He said it “was a centrepiece for the values in which the world depends on mutual respect, moderation and inter-faith harmony”.May praised Jordan’s role as a steadfast ally in the fight against terrorism and announced the UK was underwriting a $250m World Bank loan to make it easier for Jordan to borrow at lower interest rates. It would also invest in helping young Jordanians learn the English language, she said.There was little open discussion of political reform in Jordan at the conference. The government is appointed by the King and parliament has a largely consultative role."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Research says staring at screen for more than three hours a day affects language skillsIrish face severe challenges over rising emissions \u0026ndash European Commission reportMan, in his 70s, argued that mother failed in moral duty to make proper provision for himPeople rank climate change, waste, water quality and pollution as biggest issues \u0026ndash pollFine Gael TD Noel Rock accuses Labour\u0026rsquos Aodh\u0026aacuten \u0026Oacute R\u0026iacuteord\u0026aacutein of being a \u0026lsquoserial objector\u0026rsquoOne Year On: Winter storm of 2018 delivered more snow than seen in decadesMother and sister want answers over Alan Hawe\u0026rsquos murder of wife and their three sonsJudge knows one of the witnesses , a former Anglo Irish bank official, sociallyThe Duke and Duchess are on a two-day visit to Northern IrelandDenis O\u0026rsquoBrien is suing the publisher of Sunday Business Post over articles in 2015Ian Elliott defends standards in the youth organisationVaradkar: publicly-funded hospitals need to recognise not everyone is CatholicFrankie, Freddie, Theodore, Bella, Ada and Bonnie enter top 100"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3809713.1551356105!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"baby names most popular names for irish newborns in 2018 revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAgain?

It is also a strong determinant of identity as many Irish forenames feature the mark.Activists say the failure by State agencies to recognise the correct spelling of Irish names highlights the structural and cultural inequalities faced by speakers of the language when interacting with State institutions.The decision to reverse the practice of not recognising the síneadh fada was welcomed this month by the Coimisinéir Teanga, Rónán Ó Domhnaill.The coimisinéir said it highlighted the need for the Government to amend the Official Languages Bill “in order to place a responsibility upon public bodies to facilitate the síneadh fada”.While the baby names list will include the síneadh fada, an online app which allows users to research the instances of name usage going back to 1964 will not be updated in time for this morning’s publication. The CSO confirmed that the interactive app will cater for names that include the síneadh fada but said it will require more time to update the latest data set."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3809899.1551366063!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"this day last year it was 18 degrees colder as beast from the east struck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSnow drifts make roads virtually impassable in Rathmore, Co Kildare. Photograph: Niall SeargentThe , Thursday, March 1st, 2018: ‘People urged to stay indoors for blizzard’.That was the front page of our newspaper on this day last year, as the Beast from the East threatened to bring the most severe blizzard seen in decades.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pleaded for people to stay indoors as the weather system met Storm Emma and its 100kmh gales.The Beast lived up to its name delivering more snow than had been seen since the 1980s. All flights in and out of Dublin and Cork airports were cancelled, as were most forms of public transport.Schools were closed and supermarkets were cleared of fresh stock as people panicked over red weather warnings and severe conditions.A Lidl on Fortunestown Lane in Tallaght was looted with a mechanical digger, which was used to take the roof off the building and lift out the safe. The building was destroyed in the process.Roads were treacherous, almost 150,000 homes lost power and many employees were sent home from work as the worst of the forecasted snow did, indeed, land.A number of people sleeping rough and refusing to go into emergency hostels were sectioned and taken into care under the Mental Health Act. One woman, with serious mental health issues, was sectioned after being found sleeping in a hole in a wall.The snow was so deep that in one instance gardai had to ask a woman they were trying to rescue to put her handbag on the roof of her car so they could locate her.Water restrictions were put in place after the storm put serious pressure on reserves and hospital outpatient appointments had to be rescheduled.In total, 3,300 local authority staff, 2,200 iniduals from the fire service, 1,900 Civil Defence volunteers and 1,300 troops from the Defence Forces were involved in the clean-up operation.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy justified the State’s response as proportionate and attributed the precautions as one of the reasons why the storm had ran smoothly.The country was largely back up and running by the following Wednesday, almost a week after the beast landed.The Phoenix Park weather station recorded a temperature of minus 4 degrees on this day last year. Today, temperatures are forecast to reach 14 degrees in some places.Simon Bracken, a journalist with The , shares his own tale of woe here:“Ball burst, go home.” My housemate thinks I’m mad. I’m contemplating making what Theresa Mannion would deem an extremely “unnecessary journey”. It’s February 28th, 2018, the Beast from the East is on its way and the country is going into lockdown.For weeks I’ve been planning a trip to Bristol. Booked flights, concert tickets and a week off work. Today is the day. Timing has always been one of my strong points.Ryanair cancelled my first flight which was supposed to leave at 12.30pm. And my second. Dublin Airport is a no-go zone. Cork is soldiering on but will soon call it a day. Shannon is the only one left standing.There is a flight from Shannon to London Stansted at 11pm. It’s a leap of faith - if I go and the flight is cancelled I could be stuck in the airport for days.Leo Varadkar is warning of “exceptional blizzard-like” conditions on Thursday and imploring people to avoid doing exactly what I’m about to. It’s only going to get worse from here.Thirty minutes on the bus into Dublin city centre, two hours on the train from Heuston station to Limerick. Another half-hour on the bus from Limerick to Shannon.I make it to Shannon. There isn’t the slightest indication of the chaos elsewhere and, oddly, not a hint of snow or wind. The place is practically deserted apart from the disparate band of pilgrims who’ve dragged themselves here, hoping to catch the last chopper out of Saigon.We make our way to the gate, and we wait. And we wait. Everyone is nervous. Swapping stories of how they ended up here.“How far do you have to go when you get to London?”The attendant announces there’ll be another 45-minute wait as they de-ice the plane. Everyone troops off to the bar to pass the time and settle some nerves. Minutes later pints are being downed as we’re called back. The attendant misheard. It was 4-5 minutes.Finally, mercifully, we board the plane and head for London shortly after midnight.Arriving at Stansted we get a sense of what all the fuss was about. It’s absolutely Baltic and snowing heavily. We troop into the arrivals area. People are scattered everywhere. Some trying to sleep, babies foiling those plans. Others desperately looking for a way out of there before the hammer comes down.There are no buses to Bristol at this hour so it’s either stick it out here for the night and hope for the best in the morning or try to get to Paddington to catch the first train.I head out into the night again and join the enormous queue for the buses. My hands are numb, my gloves having long since given up on the enterprise.There is a man at the front of the queue who has been standing in the wrong line for about 30 minutes. He looks fit to strangle the frozen steward who is trying to break the news that he will have to line up again. Everyone is nearing breaking point.Eventually the bus arrives, and a handful of people trudge on board. While I’m thawing out, in the seat in front of me an Italian girl takes out a bread roll she can barely hold. Rarely has food been so welcome.Along comes the extraordinarily dedicated driver. “No eating on the bus”. The girl looks ready to cry.I skate along the ice into a deserted Paddington station at about 2am and I wander up to the machine to buy a ticket. That’ll be £100. One-way. At 5am. In the middle of a blizzard. The mind boggles.By 4am a band of zombies have gathered at the station. It appears to be snowing inside if that’s even possible. Thankfully for us, the girl running the coffee station takes pity on us and opens early. The restorative power of a cuppa never ceases to amaze.The 5.19 to Swansea arrives and I hop on and almost instantly fall asleep.As the train rolls into Bristol Temple Meads it has just gone 7am. One flight, two trains, three buses, suspected frostbite and almost 24 hours with no sleep. But I’ve made it.I read that Paddington has closed for the day. That was one of the last trains out. I feel like Indiana Jones. Only without his nice warm fedora.I wander into WH Smith’s and get something to eat and wait. And I wait.I look up. There she is. Wrapped up in a parka with a beaming smile and tears in her eyes. It was all worth it."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3808767.1551296156!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"france germany cast doubt on eu support for delay to brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel discussed Brexit at a joint press conference at the Elysée Palace. Photograph: Christophe MorinBloombergPresident Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday cast doubt on his and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s willingness to accept a possible vote in the British parliament to delay the UK’s departure from the European Union.“The withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU] cannot be renegotiated,” Mr Macron said. “If the British need more time, we can examine a request for a delay if it is justified by new British choices. But we can in no event accept an extension without a clear understanding of the objective being pursued.“As our negotiator Michel Barnier says, we don’t need time,” Mr Macron continued. “We need decisions. The time has come for the British to make choices and give us what we deserve as partners, friends and allies, that is to say, a clear vision and a shared plan for the future.”One month after Mr Macron and Dr Merkel signed a new treaty on Franco-German cooperation at Aachen, the mood of their joint press conference was laborious, almost lugubrious.In EU parliamentary elections three months from now, Dr Merkel fears gains by the far-right AfD. Mr Macron hopes to avert a win by the far-right leader Marine Le Pen.Yet Europe’s two most powerful leaders barely alluded to the big issues: Donald Trump’s disengagement from Europe Vladimir Putin’s determination to undermine the liberal European project Chinese economic competition migration.Mr Macron’s assertion that the Franco-German relationship is “strong, efficient and enables us to … be the two essential actors of a European policy that is better and better co-ordinated” rang hollow.Mr Macron and Dr Merkel vaunted the same “achievements” they cite at every meeting, including the June 2018 Meseberg accord, which promised a budget for the euro zone, and plans to build a Franco-German fighter aircraft and tank.Franco-German relationsDr Merkel has braked Mr Macron’s ardour through long and fraught negotiations. He pleaded for a euro zone budget of tens of billions of euros. The agreement finally reached with Germany and approved by EU finance ministers last December falls far short of Mr Macron’s ambitions. It mentions only a “budgetary instrument,” whose characteristics are supposed to be defined in June 2019.Mr Macron called Franco-German defence co-operation “unprecedented” and said it is “progressing, advancing, with real work by our armed forces and our industrialists”.The German Spiegel Online website reported that the Aachen Treaty was almost not signed, because of a Franco-German dispute over policy on arms sales. Dr Merkel wanted an EU boycott on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia after the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. France considers that weapons sales are in its own strategic interest, and Mr Macron refused.France refused to allow restrictions on German arms sales to apply to materiel produced in joint projects. According to Spiegel Online, the Aachen Treaty was salvaged with a secret annex stating that neither government will attempt to block exports by the other.A recent crisis over the Nord Stream II gas pipeline between Russia and Germany brought Paris and Berlin to the brink of an open row. In the end, France compromised on a move to shift the power of decision from Germany to Brussels, but French recalcitrance was interpreted as a warning to Berlin.Mr Macron confirmed that the Dutch government had not informed France of its intention to equal Air France’s 14.3 per cent share of Air France-KLM. The announcement on Tuesday night was seen as hostile and comparable to a corporate raid. It was “up to the Dutch government to clarify its intentions,” Mr Macron said.Also on Tuesday, the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner asked French authorities to refrain from using riot guns known as LBDs. Since he supports European decisions, Mr Macron was asked, would he comply with the recommendation?“The best way to avoid their use is for people to stop thinking Saturday afternoons are made for breaking windows, attacking institutions and the forces of order,” Mr Macron said. Gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protestors have demonstrated for the past 15 consecutive Saturdays.“I will not leave the forces of order with no means of ensuring public order or of defending themselves against people who come with weapons and the worst intentions,” the French president concluded.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This is important because most scientists agree that any life on Mars would have to occur below the surface to escape the harsh surface conditions where high radiation, low temperature and lack of water make life unlikely.We found microbes adapted to high salt levels, similar to what may be expected in the Martian subsurface. These microbes are very different from those previously known to occur on the surface of deserts.Nasa finds new form of DNA in search for alien lifeBoth Nasa and the European Space Agency are preparing to send rovers to Mars in 2020. Those will roam over the surface and look for evidence of life, either in the past or the present, as well as drilling under the surface in an attempt to pull up any microbial life that might be hiding beneath there.Testing of this kind helps ensure that the missions succeed and shows that rovers should be able to deal with the harsh environment on Mars.The core of the Atacama Desert in Chile is extremely dry, experiencing decades without rainfall. It has high surface UV radiation exposure and is comprised of very salty soil. It\u0027s the closest match we have on Earth to Mars, which makes it good for testing simulated missions to this planet, said Pointing in a statement.The rover was put into the Atacama Desert to see if it would be able to pull up sediment samples as deep as 80cm\u0026nbspbeneath the surface. The samples it did gather were then compared with those taken by hand – and researchers found they were similar, suggesting that the rover was a success.The same test also found the microbes were living in patches across the surface, related to the difficult environment in which it was living.These results confirm a basic ecological rule that microbial life is patchy in Earth\u0027s most extreme habitats, which hints that past or present life on other planets may also exhibit patchiness, explain study co-authors Nathalie Cabrol and Kim Warren-Rhodes of The SETI Institute.While this will make detection more challenging, our findings provide possible signposts to guide the exploration for life on Mars, demonstrating that it is possible to detect life with smart robotic search and sampling strategies.Scientists now hope they can drill even further into the surface and see how deep microbial life might be able to thrive.Mars missions hope to drill to approximately 2m and so having an Earth-based comparison will help identify potential problems and the interpretation of results once rovers are deployed there, said Pointing.Ecological studies that help us predict the habitable areas for microbial communities in Earth\u0027s most extreme environments will also be critical to finding life on other planets.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now they\u0027re branching out so a lot of their businesses have been very good.With little real-world testing, it is difficult to say whether the usefulness of foldable phones will lead to them replacing traditional smartphones on any significant scale. Should this prove to be the case, however, Apple may once again hope that being late to the game pays off.There are already signs that Apple may be developing a foldable gadget, with a patent for a Flexible display device published earlier this month.\u0026nbspRenders\u0026nbspcreated by Dutch designer Roy Gilsing\u0026nbsphave imagined\u0026nbspwhat a folding Apple phone might look like.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) posted a 6.7 per cent increase in revenue, from €22.9bn (£19.6bn) to €24.4bn, while pre-tax profit increased by 11.2 per cent, rising from €2bn to €2.9bn.The company said the improved numbers came in spite of a jump in fuel costs, which were up 30 per cent over the year. IAG was also hit by a net foreign exchange impact of €129m in 2018. The group said it was continuing to “evaluate and prepare for the potential changes following the UK’s decision to leave the EU”.“As we move into 2019, there is continued political uncertainty, fuel-price volatility and the ongoing risk of impact to our operations and reputation as the frequency, nature and sophistication of cyberattacks increases,” IAG said.Created with Sketch.

If you go back a year, people were saying, ‘will we be able to fly at all?’ I dismissed all of that and I think I’ve been proven correct.”Earlier this month, IAG placed a limit on non-EU shareholders, but said UK residents would be treated in the same way as those from the EU even after Brexit.Mr Walsh said: “This is nothing to do with Brexit. It’s actually been in our articles since we created IAG back in 2011. It was in all of the merger documentation that we issued to shareholders and was approved by shareholders.”Shares in IAG rose 2.4 per cent in early trading.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He tells Andy Martin how he worked his way back to successClick to followThe IndependentBack in 2007, Queen Elizabeth II was shown, in a short clip, seemingly stomping out of a photoshoot with Annie Leibovitz, muttering under her breath, clearly bad-tempered, having taken offence at the suggestion she should take her crown off. Not scandalous, surely? No, but it was an early example of fake news. In fact, the Queen had arrived in a bit of a mood\u0026nbspbut had also enjoyed the shoot, and only unfortunate editing\u0026nbspturned it around and made more of a drama out of it. The tabloids then piled in and talked of betrayal or treason, calling for heads to roll.\u0026nbspOne of the heads belonged to David Frank, then chief executive of RDF Television, now cofounder and executive chairman of TRX (or The RightsXchange), an online marketplace for television.His head is still on his shoulders. He didn’t end up in the Tower of London. “It was a perfect storm of misfortune,” he recalls, sitting in a boardroom in Somerset House, a stone’s throw from the Thames. “Just an amazing cockup.” There was an out-of-the-blue phone call from the BBC\u0026nbspasking\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspthey had\u0026nbspany material that could be included in a showreel for their forthcoming documentary series, The Royal Family at Work. An editor noticed\u0026nbspthey had a tape – thrown together by way of a pitch to other TV companies elsewhere in Europe. It wasn’t supposed to be shown on television at all. But the helpful editor, unbeknownst to higher powers, had it couriered over to the BBC and the offending item duly appeared on the Nine O’clock News.Then, as Frank recalls:\u0026nbsp“The shit really hit the fan.” Apologies and resignations (including the controller of the BBC and RDF’s creative director) all round. “The BBC and ITV suspended operations with us, pending inquiries. Our share price collapsed. It went from something like 270 pence to 60 pence in a couple of months.” It was the worst crisis Frank had ever experienced. “We became the story.”\u0026nbspThe royal to do\u0026nbspbecame known as Queengate, or Crowngate.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II: Life in pictures  Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II on a walk-about in Portsmouth during her Silver Jubilee tour of Great Britain, 1977The future Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth II (R) pictured with her younger sister Princess Margaret (L) in 1933The 9-year-old Elizabeth attends an aristocratic wedding with her mother and younger sister.

David Frank is the first CEO I’ve interviewed who once worked for The Independent. He\u0026nbspoffered me this encouragement: “The barriers to entering TV are incredibly low. It’s not that complicated, telly – no more than journalism.” He was born in Kenya in 1958, studied law at Oxford\u0026nbspand was employed as a lawyer for a grand total of 6 weeks until his exam results came through. Which is when he was fired. “I didn’t really fancy being a lawyer anyway,” Frank says. He went into investment banking\u0026nbspbut soon dropped out and started writing a column for The Independent\u0026nbspabout\u0026nbspcapital markets instead. He had a notion he could do something similar for television and applied for 20 jobs at the BBC but\u0026nbspdidn’t even get interviewed. Then, through a friendly contact, he fluked a job as a presenterinterviewer\u0026nbspdoing news and current affairs segments for a number of news programmes. “I loved all that,” he says. “But the BBC was anything but a meritocracy. You had to wait till somebody died before you could get a better job. There was a feeling of Groundhog Day.”So, begging, borrowing and not quite stealing the finance, he set himself up as an independent producer, RDF. He sold his first programme, to Channel 4 in 1993, about\u0026nbspindustrial espionage. “It wasn’t a very good programme, to be honest,” he says. “We had a small amount of footage and a lot of conspiracy theorists.” His younger brother Matthew, then a radio journalist, joined him on the sales side. They ended up making some classic series, such as Scrapheap Challenge\u0026nbsp(guys racing to put weird machines together out of junk). Their “human interest” stories (“mainly royals or mad\u0026nbspeccentric Brits”) sold around the world, notably anything to do with Princess Diana, pre- or post-car crash.But it was the Communications Act of 2003 that was the real gamechanger. The new legislation meant\u0026nbspterrestrial broadcasters would no longer own the programmes they commissioned, and the independents were free to sell their wares again and again. RDF already had its own sales house and became the outlet for 40 or so other independent programme-makers, selling rights on their behalf. They floated in 2005, with a turnover of some £40m, then hit the royal buffers in 2007. When RDF was sold to Zodiac, Frank moved over to become CEO of Zodiac. But he eventually resigned to set up TRX with his brother, a “next generation” company, in 2015. They have only a small and select staff. Their mantra is “More Deals, Less Hassle”. \u0026nbspDavid Frank radiates an almost zen-like calm and confidence and can laugh about past dramas. He and his brother Matthew are still best friends and go to watch Arsenal games together. They live within a few hundred yards of one another in Putney and avoid traffic jams by taking the Thames river bus every day to the Embankment and walking to Somerset House. TRX aims to make global TV transactions just as smooth and relaxing.A View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View From the Top: Peter Simpson of Anglian WaterA View from the Top with Zia Yusuf, CEO of concierge service VelocityThe number of broadcasters has increased exponentially in the last 20 years. So has the number of programme-makers. TRX offers to put them all together, online, to provide a cloud-based platform for buying and selling rights. “If we’re successful, this could be worth billions,” says Frank. “I’m not that motivated by money, but the valuation of a company is a validation of what you do.” Frank doesn’t miss making programmes. “The nature of ‘creatives’ is that they’re difficult people to work with,” he says. “They’re short on compromise. That’s their strength. But managing them is hard work. I don’t have to do that here. Now we’re making technology, not programmes. It’s different, but I’m having more fun than ever. And it’s a lot better than Queengate.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Although it made a loss overall, it\u0027s possible to see some green shoots peering through the hard ground\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentThe Co-operative Bank is much diminished, but has reported an operating profit for the first time in yearsGiven its travails, the natural reaction of many to a set of results from the Co-operative Bank would be to say ‘what, it’s still here?’Yes it is. It’s a lot smaller, with just 68 branches, down from over 300, and the Co-operative Group no longer has any shareholding in it. Ownership is mostly in the hands of hedge funds after it almost went under.\u0026nbspBut despite it all, the Co-op Bank in still trading, has stuck to its ethical creed and today reported a significant achievement. Last year it made money. Sort of.\u0026nbspCo-op Bank returns to profit for first time in five yearsDisgraced ex-Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers banned from CityCo-op Bank gets approval for £700m rescue deal The business recorded an operating profit of just under £15m in 2018, compared with a loss of £84m the previous year. That represents the first such profit in half a decade.\u0026nbspBut the key word is “operating”. Chuck in everything else - one off costs, investments etc - and the\u0026nbsp bank still spent the year in the red overall, recording a pre tax loss of just under £141m, similar to the number posted in 2017.\u0026nbspThat’s where the challenge comes in.\u0026nbspThe bank is likely to remain under water for some time at the headline level. CEO Andrew Bester, the latest in through what has been something of a revolving door at the top, has been notably vague about when that might change, talking only about being back in black at the conclusion of a five year transformation programme.\u0026nbspFaced with operating in an economy beset with uncertainty thanks to Britain’s dismal government, the business is far from out of the woods.\u0026nbspBut it is just possible to see some green shoots peeping through the hard ground.\u0026nbspIn addition to that all important operating profit, mortgage completions were at their highest level since 2010. The net interest margin - the difference between what borrowers pay and depositors are paid - was above 2 per cent. Business areas the bank had pulled out of are now being looked at again. As application is in for the second tranche of funding RBS has had to put up for small business banks as a consequence of its enormous bailout.\u0026nbspCEO Andrew Bester, a veteran of Lloyds and Standard Chartered, can point to things happening.The Co-operative Bank is a very different organisation to what he’s been used to.\u0026nbspHe’s gone from being part of the team running an ocean liner to skippering a sailing dinghy.\u0026nbspThe business he runs is small and niche and always will be. But despite all that it has been through, the brand, and its stance, are still attractive to a certain kind of organisation, those for which profit isn’t the prime motivation. It is also still attractive to a certain kind of person. You wouldn’t expect to find Co-op investing in oil sands or other projects that will exacerbate climate change, for example, by contrast to some of Britain’s bigger banks.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Now it is in that situation\u0026nbspthere are others who also have claims upon its assets, claims that may take priority over those of the aggrieved customers.\u0026nbspWere this a savings company of some description that wouldn\u0027t be the case. There would be compensation available to anyone losing out through the savings industry funded Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\u0026nbspTrouble is it doesn’t cover lenders even though the FCA has been regulating them since 2014.\u0026nbspAndrew Bailey, the boss of the FCA, says consideration has been given to including them but “in the event of the failure of a lender… customers generally don’t suffer losses. Loan customers are more likely to owe money to the lend rather than the other way round”.\u0026nbspIn most cases that’s true, but not in this one because of the way Wonga was carrying on.\u0026nbspAs a result thousands of people look set to be left out of pocket, calling that decision into question.So what next?Bailey makes the point that it would be a bit rum if the savings companies that pay into the FSCS were now called upon to bail out the past misconduct of a lender.\u0026nbspWhile some of them also are lenders, that’s by no means true of all them and so you’d be robbing Peter to pay for\u0026nbspthe misdeeds of Paul.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) posted a 6.7 per cent increase in revenue, from €22.9bn (£19.6bn) to €24.4bn, while pre-tax profit increased by 11.2 per cent, rising from €2bn to €2.9bn.The company said the improved numbers came in spite of a jump in fuel costs, which were up 30 per cent over the year. IAG was also hit by a net foreign exchange impact of €129m in 2018. The group said it was continuing to “evaluate and prepare for the potential changes following the UK’s decision to leave the EU”.“As we move into 2019, there is continued political uncertainty, fuel-price volatility and the ongoing risk of impact to our operations and reputation as the frequency, nature and sophistication of cyberattacks increases,” IAG said.Created with Sketch.

If you go back a year, people were saying, ‘will we be able to fly at all?’ I dismissed all of that and I think I’ve been proven correct.”Earlier this month, IAG placed a limit on non-EU shareholders, but said UK residents would be treated in the same way as those from the EU even after Brexit.Mr Walsh said: “This is nothing to do with Brexit. It’s actually been in our articles since we created IAG back in 2011. It was in all of the merger documentation that we issued to shareholders and was approved by shareholders.”Shares in IAG rose 2.4 per cent in early trading.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Many of M\u0026ampS’s customers\u0026nbspthat want online grocery shopping\u0026nbspare already Ocado customers, he says.“It may have overestimated the lure of M\u0026ampS products, and indeed the questionable benefits of being able to order an M\u0026ampS dress with a weekly shop.”\u0026nbspThe new tie-up can be a success but only if M\u0026ampS sticks to the premium products it’s famous for like, says George Lawrie, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester.“In other words, it will work for champagne, fresh oysters, canapes and caviar, but not for things like cling film and carrots,” he says. This marries with Ocado’s vision of a premium delivery experience, with smartly dressed drivers delivering your groceries straight to your kitchen table.Luxury deliveries work better because of cost, Lawrie explains.“Normally you’d expect picking, packing and transporting produce to amount to around 25-30 per cent of the cost of a single item, a cost that high margin retailers can absorb but low margin grocery cannot – unless everything is highly automated.”M\u0026ampS clearly can’t compete with the big supermarkets when it comes to customers’ weekly shops, says Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds shares in M\u0026ampS.He is also pessimistic about the deal, describing the £600m M\u0026ampS is raising to pay for the new venture as an “extravagant use of shareholders’ money”.“The motivations behind this deal for M\u0026ampS are clear, as the company has long struggled with an online offering that is not up to scratch.”The benefits to M\u0026ampS of an online food shopping are not certain because of the limited range of products it stocks, says Mumford. Consumers see it as a place to top up their weekly food shop with premium items, rather than somewhere for a large weekly shop.But that’s not so much a problem as it might once have been because Ocado has become less dependent on Waitrose products and now stocks broad range of own-brand and private label products, says Stephen Lienert, senior analyst at Jefferies.“Ocado therefore goes full circle: whereas before people used Ocado to access Waitrose products, now the supermarkets want to use Ocado.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” So, the initial emphasis will inevitably be on the vast back catalogues of\u0026nbspboth companies, going back to the 1950s. In principle, a viewer might chose to watch every episode of Coronation Street since it was first shown on\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspDecember\u0026nbsp1960, or the 5,875 episodes of EastEnders made since 1986. Either would make for\u0026nbspquite a binge.\u0026nbspEvery Morse, every Doctor Who (at least the ones where the tapes haven’t been wiped), every Avengers, and every Dad’s Army\u0026nbspevery Morecambe \u0026amp Wise show, every recent hit drama such as The Night Manager or Vera\u0026nbsp– all would be available on demand, for a subscription fee.\u0026nbspIn due course, though, the BBC and ITV hope to\u0026nbspcommission new series especially for BritBox, just as competitors such as Netflix\u0026nbspand Amazon do. How and when these series might find their way onto their conventional channels is unclear. Other things being equal, like many digital content providers in every field, they would have to offer their subscribers something special,\u0026nbspwhich is not available for free elsewhere, to justify the fees.How much will BritBox cost to the viewers?There is speculation that it might be as little as £5 per month, though this has not been confirmed, beyond the BBC and ITV saying it will be “competitive”. As with other streaming services, it might be available direct or via other data providers, such as BT in the UK.In principle, given the BBC’s charter, major licence fee funding might be problematic. ITV have pledged some £65million initially the BBC will not comment\u0026nbspon its financial commitment.Why are the BBC and ITV doing this now?The truth is, they have little choice. Streaming of high quality programming, using the Internet (and or satellite and cable) and bypassing traditional broadcasting methods, have caused massive disruption. Younger viewers, especially, are more likely to use the likes of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube for their video entertainment than they are to\u0026nbspsettle down with a cup of tea and a biscuit in front of Emmerdale or Newsnight. BBC to air rival Leaving Neverland Michael Jackson documentary ITV and the BBC\u0027s BritBox streaming service has potential BBC invites public to take control of its Brexit coverageThis fragmentation of the market is something that conventional broadcasters such as ITV and the BBC have dreaded for years – the moment of “peak television”, beyond which\u0026nbspviewing figures start to decline.The traditional broadcasters are also attracted by the prospect\u0026nbspof establishing a worldwide presence. Netflix, for example, has 56 million users – about the population of the UK. If BritBox can become a global player, then new possibilities for programming open up. Netflix commissions well over 100 new series a year – more than anyone else on the planet. If BritBox succeeds, it will create a virtuous circle where new shows attract new subscribers, and the revenues from their fees and any accompanying advertising is used to commission more shows, which will attract more viewers, and so on.If anything, the move is overdue. The new kids on the block\u0026nbsphave been eroding the BBC and ITV market share for some years. An attempt to create something like BritBox in the UK at the start of the decade was blocked by the competition authorities. They no longer seem inclined to do so.Will it succeed?Well, the BBC and ITV have a superb record when it comes to\u0026nbspcreating hit drama series\u0026nbspin particular, many of which have been popular worldwide. Comedies, documentaries, nature and arts programming might also attract major new audiences through the new platform. The BBC also has a global reputation for impartial and investigative\u0026nbspnews-gathering – an increasingly precious asset in a world of “fake news”.\u0026nbspMassive global hits such as The Crown (Netflix) or Game of Thrones (HBO) could easily have been made by the British broadcasters\u0026nbsp– but they now lack the financial heft to do so. To give one example,\u0026nbspthe budget for each episode of Amazon Prime’s The Grand Tour is about £4.5million for the BBC’s Top Gear it is £500,000. Why Roma’s awards-season success is such a big win for NetflixThe Beeb\u0026nbspand ITV are simply\u0026nbspbeing out-done commercially if not artistically. They are too small and too focused on the UK in what has rapidly become a globalised business.So the talent (Olivia Colman, as a symbol), the creativity and the expertise are all there – London is already a world centre for post-production and the UK has excellent film and studio facilities. What may be lacking is the business acumen that could really make the new service a success. ITV and BBC executives are simply too parochial and inexperienced in this field – as opposed to programme-making and dealing with awkward MPs – and would need to require some potentially expensive (possibly foreign) commercial nous to pilot them to success, just like Premier League football teams.Alternatively, in the longer run, they might consider forming some sort of more cooperative relationship with the\u0026nbspestablished streaming services, though again that would bring its own complications, not least because of the BBC\u0027s status as a state-owned broadcaster with no private shareholders and a unique agenda.Can I watch the very latest episodes of Emmerdale or Endeavour on there?Probably not. The idea is that the most recent and live material will still be broadcast on-line via the BBC’s existing iPlayer and ITV\u0027s Hub service (for all their various channels, including radio in the case of the BBC).What about Brexit?BritBox could be a pioneer of the new “global Britain”, an international player in a fast-developing market concentrating on the kind of value-added creative content that the world will pay good money for. British programming and show formats have traditionally sold well abroad, and this would be a massive extension of that tradition. Early days, but BritBox could be transformational.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).However, fans of the film discovered that the Netflix version does not have the nurse discovering they are dead, therefore leaving viewers on a more uplifting note as they just lie in bed together.Responding to fan outcry on Twitter, the streamer wrote on Twitter: “Things you should know\u0026nbsp– we did not edit the notebook – an alternate version exists and was supplied to us – we are getting to the bottom of it asap – apparently some films have more than one ending?”Meanwhile, The Independent recently debuted the first trailer for the Netflix series The OA, which you can watch here.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.The colours that people can normally see are just a small fraction of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes extreme shades like infrared and ultraviolet.These signals, which have either much longer or shorter wavelengths than the rainbow spectrum we are familiar with, are constantly bouncing around us.Human and mouse eyes both contain rods and cones – cells that absorb light and convert it into electrical impulses that are sent to our brains. Infrared wavelengths are too long for these cells to absorb.Blind mice see again after scientists use ‘simple’ genetic procedureThe nanoparticles then convert these signals into shorter wavelengths and funnel them into the cells so they can be transmitted to the brain as green light.Scientists injected this substance into the rodents’ eyes, before carrying out a series of tests to determine what effect they had on mouse vision.When infrared was shone into the eye of a treated mouse, its pupil contracted in a clear signal it was detecting the light.Further tests conducted in mazes revealed the mice could see infrared patterns shone onto a surface even during the daylight.The injection produced minimal side effects, and the mice retained their infrared abilities for over two months.“We believe this technology will also work in human eyes, not only for generating super-vision but also for therapeutic solutions in human red-colour vision deficits,” said Dr Xue.The scientists also speculated about possible future applications in which nanotechnology-enhanced humans might have roles in security and military settings.But first, Dr Xue said, the team will have to test the safety of the procedure in experiments using other primates.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The firm now claims to have more than 500 million monthly active users across 150 countries.The FTC\u0027s complaint alleged that\u0026nbspTikTok\u0026nbspfailed to get consent and also did not delete personal information when parents requested the firm to do so.\u0026nbspUnder the Children\u0027s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), apps and websites aimed at children are required to obtain parental consent in order to gather their data.\u0026nbsp“The operators of Musical.ly – now known as\u0026nbspTikTok\u0026nbsp– knew many children were using the app but they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses, and other personal information from users under the age of 13,” said FTC chairman Joe Simons.This record penalty should be a reminder to all online services and websites that target children: We take enforcement of COPPA very seriously, and we will not tolerate companies that flagrantly ignore the law.TikTok said in a statement that it cares deeply about the safety and privacy of our users, adding,\u0026nbspThis is an ongoing commitment, and we are continuing to expand and evolve our protective measures in support of this.A spokesperson for\u0026nbspTikTok\u0026nbspwas not immediately available for comment on whether such measures would be introduced outside of the US.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is within our grasp and I am grateful to have your continued support in that important mission.Nigel Farage has announced plans for a 14-day Brexit betrayal march - culminating in a rally in Westminster on March 29.The former Ukip leader will march from Sunderland to London, starting on March 16, alongside\u0026nbspLeave Means Leave founder Richard Tice and Chairman John Longworth.\u0026nbspMr Farage said: “The Westminster elite are in the process of betraying the British people over Brexit. All of us who want Britain to be a great country once again accept that we must be prepared to stand up for what we believe in and fight for our independence.”Reaction is coming in to George Eustice\u0027s shock resignation over possible delays to Brexit.Ex-Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said:\u0026nbspIt is odd that the Minster has resigned complaining about Brexit delays when his department has delayed new laws on agriculture and fisheries post-Brexit.But this clearly shows the Conservative Government is still hopelessly ided and that Theresa May\u0027s empty promises aren\u0027t helping. That\u0027s why we need to hand the decision back to the public, with an option to stay in the EU.Cabinet ministers face losing Conservative backbench support over difficulties policies if they fail to deliver Brexit on March 29, the Commons has heard.David Davies, Tory chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee, insisted the UK must leave the EU by the end of next month - with or without a deal.And the MP for Monmouth advised ministers they must play their role in delivering Brexit or risk losing support when they push their own ideas.Speaking during the annual St David\u0027s Day debate, Mr Davies told the Commons: The people of Britain and Wales have voted to leave the European Union and if there\u0027s been a failing, there\u0027s been a failing by the European Union for not being able to instil the confidence that they want in the people of this nation.I very much hope that all those who feel there\u0027s going to be some detrimental impact if we leave without a deal are willing to back the Prime Minister.I believe we must be out by the end of March and I hope all ministers and all Cabinet ministers are aware of that, and are aware that if they want our support for difficult policies we need to be out - with or without a deal - by the end of March.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU will only agree to extend Article 50 if the UK has a good reason.\u0026nbspSpeaking after meeting Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz,\u0026nbsphe said:\u0026nbspIf it is asked, European leaders will say \u0027What for?\u0027 and the duration of this potential extension will be linked to \u0027What for?\u0027.The government is set to release a series of TV adverts explaining the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit to the public, the head of the Civil Service has said.\u0026nbspCabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill told MPs that the adverts would follow radio commercials\u0026nbspthat have been aired since January. The government has also began taking out adverts in newspapers.Dismissing suggestions that the government\u0027s messaging is not working, he said:Iniduals and citizens and businesses are making their own judgments.The information is available. We\u0027ve been putting it out on the website for several months, that\u0027s now been complemented by some radio advertising. We have plans to bring through some television advertising as well.So there is a communications campaign, but of course citizens and businesses are aware of that but they also look at the front pages and the news bulletins and they make a judgment, their own judgments, about the likelihood of no deal on 29 March.\u0026nbspMPs will receive a 2.7 per cent pay rise next year, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) has announced.The increase will take the standard salary from £77,379 to £79,468.The chairs of Commons select committees will receive an additional\u0026nbsp£15,509 - up from £15,235 this year.Speaking about the votes in\u0026nbspWestminster\u0026nbspon Tuesday night, Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy PM,\u0026nbspsaid it had become clear to Theresa May that there was a majority in her parliament that want to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspThis now comes down to the negotiation between the UK and EU over the next few weeks and the build-up to the 12th of March, or some time before that potentially, where the British Prime Minister will try to get ratification from her parliament for any final deal, he said.I think the EU parliament wants to work with the UK to try to give the reassurance and clarification to get that done, particularly around the protocol on Ireland and the Irish backstop, he said.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Just holding out possibility of a short delay, too short for a #peoplesvote” she tweeted.Significantly, the prime minister refused to say whether she would “argue for no-deal or argue for extension”, if her deal is thrown out again on 12 March.Labour’s Yvette Cooper hinted she would continue to press her amendment tomorrow, to legally compel Ms May to seek an Article 50 extension if her deal is not approved.Suggesting the legal force was crucial, Ms Cooper warned: “Promised votes have been pulled before, Commons motions have been ignored before. If there is no legislation in place, what assurances do we have that the government will abide by any votes?”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Students are coming to attend those universities, but obviously they go home at the end of those courses in the vast majority of cases.”He insisted Ms May had always argued it would “take time” to achieve the target of net migration below 100,000, adding: “We are taking steps to deliver upon that.”Meanwhile, overall EU net migration stood at 57,000 after 145,000 European citizens left and 202,000 arrived.People from EU8 countries, including Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary, left in the highest numbers, with 53,000 departing during the year.Matthew Fell, the CBI’s chief UK policy director, said: “Fewer EU workers are coming to the UK, exacerbating labour and skills shortages across many sectors, from farm labourers to engineers. Businesses cannot succeed without access to skills and labour.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

He\u0027s very defensive, his military has been built up a lot, Trump said.In Case 4000, police alleged that Mr Netanyahu granted regulatory favours to Israel’s leading telecommunications company, Bezeq, in return for more positive coverage on Walla, a news website belonging to Bezeq’s owner Shaul Elovitch. The attorney general indicted him for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Mr Netanyahu\u0027s wife Sara was also embroiled in the accusations.\u0026nbspIsrael may be guilty of war crimes over Palestinian deaths, UN saysIsrael’s hands are all over India’s escalating conflict with PakistanNetanyahu in Moscow turns to a friend for help with IranPro-Israel lobby groups slam Netanyahu for alliance with \u0027extremists\u0027Israel’s accusation that Poles collaborated with Nazis ‘racist’In Case 1000 he was indicted for allegedly receiving gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian businessman James Packer, in return for political favours.Case 2000,Mr Netanyahu is accused of negotiating a deal with the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper to limit the coverage of rival newspaper Israel Hayom, in return for better coverage. The attorney general also announced plans to charge Arnon Mozes, Yedioth Ahronoth’s publisher.Mr Netanyahu’s lawyers unsuccessfully pleaded with the top prosecutor to delay his decision until after the elections, saying it will unfairly impact the results.There are no legal ramifications if Mr Netanyahu runs in the election with an indictment over him, but several coalition partners have baulked at the idea of forming a coalition under those circumstances.Mr Netanyahu had hoped he would be re-elected to serve a fourth consecutive term, making him the longest-serving prime minster in Israel’s history.The popularity of his right-wing Likud party has plummeted in the polls, particularly after the creation of Blue and White Party, an alliance of popular ex-army chief Benny Gantz, and one of Israel’s main opposition leaders Yair Lapid.In the latest poll released by Times of Israel\u0026nbspon Thursday it showed the Likud party would lose four seats securing just 25 places in the 120-seat Knesset if charges are announced.Netanyahu stands by his wife Sara on the day Israel Securities Authority recommended indicting them both on bribery and other corruption charges (Photo by Lior MizrahiGetty Images)The Blue and White party, Mr Netanyahu’s chief rival, meanwhile would soar dramatically from 36 to 44 seats, giving them the clear lead.But the key to the whether the premier can stay in office is over his ability to form a coalition. Until very recently Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition was still larger and more powerful than a potential centrist one sculpted by Blue and White.Nevertheless, the Times of Israel’s polls showed that future criminal charges resulting from the indictment would blast Netanyahu’s ability to form a right-wing Ultra-Orthodox bloc bigger enough to form a majority coalition.Mr Netanyahu’s defence has argued in Case 4000 that there was no connection between his actions with Bezeq and what occurred in Walla’s editorial offices, and his decisions were reasonable as he was communications minister at the time.Netanyahu shortened an already delayed visit to Russia as problems mount ahead of April general elections (Getty Images)He defended himself in Case 1000 saying it’s permissible to accept gifts form trends.Alan Dershowitz, a prominent American lawyer, has come to Mr Netanyahu\u0027s defence, publishing an open letter to attorney-general Mandelblit in which he warns that an indictment against the prime minister ahead of elections would undermine the democratic process.I\u0027m very worried for freedom of the press and freedom of government in Israel if they start indicting people for trying to get good coverage from the media, he told Israel\u0027s Army Radio.I don\u0027t know of any other country that has criminalized trying to get good coverage and make that a basis of bribery or any other corruption investigation.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Heres the latest on how its affecting your cash.On February  the pound is trading at . against the euro.The British currency is pushing higher than the euro because of hopes Brexit will be delayed.The prospect of the Prime Minister ruling out a no-deal Brexit has caused the exchange rate to rise sharply.Theresa May said the government would seek to speed up ratication of its Brexit withdrawal deal with the European Uniontime gets too tight.Lee Hardman, currencies analyst at MUFG said: The recent bigger picture is still that market participants are actively pursuing downside protection.He said that sterling markets remained relatively calm, with the spot price reflecting more confidence that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the EU. But as the clock ticks down, that optimism is likely to fade, Hardman noted.Before the EU referendum in June  a pound was trading for around €.. Sterling fell around  per cent after the result.The highest rate in recent years was €. in November .Foreign exchangemarkets allow currencies to be bought and sold around the world.They are necessary for international commerce but are also opportunities for traders to make a profit by effectively gambling on whether rates go up or down.As in any market, rates are determined by the price that buyers and sellers are willing to accept.If more people are buying than selling the price will go up, and vice versa.Traders confidence in a countrys economic health is the biggest factor shaping forex markets.Reports and forecasts on GDP growth, inflation, employment, retail sales and manufacturing can prompt traders to buy or sell a countrys currency.Other factors that sway forex markets include interest rate decisions by central banks , and news such as the signing of a trade deal or a natural disaster.Movements in global capital markets, bond markets and stock markets can also influence forex trading.Banks and money changers who sell holiday cash broadly follow foreign exchange markets in the rates they offer the public.The buy and sell price for each currency is usually a few percentage points either side of the true rate so they can make a profit eventhere is no commission.Unstable and unpredictable government events can also negatively impact the pounds strength in trading.Following the resignations of Theresa Mays Cabinet in response to her draft Brexit proposal on Thursday, the pound plummeted to its lowest value in over a year.Euros can be bought at supermarkets, such as Marks  Spencer, as well as the Post Office and currency specialists – but rates y massively.The best rates can often be found at specialist online outlets, such as Travelex, which will deliver cash directly to your home.Travellers can use comparison sites, like MoneySavingExperts TravelMoneyMax, to find the best rate.If you order in advance and pick up the cash then you’ll most likely get a better rate thanyou walk into a bureau de change.Alternatively, providers such as FairFX and WeSwap offer currency cards that can load up at a good rate and then use abroad like a debit card without transaction fees on each purchase.You can always buy last-minute currency at the airport or withdraw cash at your destination, but its almost always cheaper to buy before you go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown.On February , , seven MPs held a press conference to announce they were quitting the Labour party and forming a new Independent Group.It was the most signicant breakaway since the formation of the Social Democratic Party in the early s.On February  a ninth MP also quit and joined their group.The rebels are:They are furious at Jeremy Corbyns Brexit stance and his handling of the anti-Semitism scandal that still dogs the party.Jewish MP Luciana Berger - who has faced vicious abuse from left-wingers - said: I cannot remain in a party that I have come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic.Chris Leslie said the party had been hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left.And Mr Gapes blasted: I am sickened that the Labour Party is now a racist and anti-Semitic party.The seven rebels from the centrist wing of the Labour party have called themselves The Independent Group.It already has a website although it had no content at the time of the announcement.Its Twitter account racked up more than , followers in the first hour after it was opened.It is thought they will sit as independents in the House of Commons, rather than forming an official party at this stage.Mr Umunna, seen as the most likely leader of the group, said: Fundamental change is needed.The established parties are not up to this change. They can’t be the change as they have become the problem.On February  Joan Ryan, chairman of Labour Friends of Israel, also quit the party over Jeremy Corbyns failure to deal with face of evil anti-Semitism.She slammed the Labour leader and the Stalinist clique that surrounds him and said he was not fit to be prime minister.MP Ian Austin quit the Labour Party over its “culture of extremism, anti-Semitism and intolerance.”The Member of Parliament for Dudley North, who is pro-Brexit, insists he will not be joining the newly formed Independent Group which is pushing for a second referendum.Rumours of a pending split in the Labour party have swirled since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in .And speculation reached a frenzy over the weekend amid reports a group of MPs would finally stage a walkout and launch a breakaway party.The confirmation by the seven rebels came after reports Labour moderates had reached breaking point over Jeremy Corbyns Brexit stance, particularly his refusal to back a second referendum.Former frontbencher Chuka Umunna said on Thursday he did not “give a damn... about keeping any party together” when compared to the overriding priority of the national interest in avoiding a No Deal Brexit.And ex-shadow chancellor Chris Leslie told the House of Commons Labour supporters are being “played for fools” by the leadership.Corbyn tonight announced he will back a second Brexit referendum which could betray .million Leave voters.The leftie leader pledged to support moves for a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit - after months of dithering.Corbyn said he would throw Labours support behind a second referendumMPs vote down his alternative plans, which propose keeping Britain in the EUs customs union and tie the country close to the single market.Hours later, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry confirmed the party would campaign to remain.On Friday, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray said MPs were being pushed to the brink.Mr Murray refused to sign a provocative pledge shared on social media as part of efforts to shore up party unity, insisting his loyalty was not in question.He insisted his loyalty to Labour was not in question.On Sunday shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned a split would cost seats like the SDP breakaway in , which installed Mrs Thatcher in power for a decade.He told the BBC: I dont think any of the people whove even been mentioned about this split would want that.Former party deputy chairman Michael Dugher revealed in the Sun on Sunday on February  he was quitting Labour after  years because of anti-Semitism.He said: “It pains me to see what the Labour party has become.I can no longer justy paying subs to a party which I now regard as institutionally anti-Semitic.Mr Dugher stood down as an MP at the last election, but current MPs have long been said to be close to quitting and Brexit could be the tipping point for some.Up to  current MPs fear they will fall victim to a massive purge by new left-wing activists who have flooded the party.Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper are among those said to be at risk of deselection.Some may decide to jump before they are pushed, switching to a new centrist party that has long been touted in Westminster.Moderates and Remainers have called on the Labour leader to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum.Until Feb , fed-up MPs have shied away from quitting but the decision threw the party leadership into fresh turmoil.One of the potential splitters has reportedly told colleagues thatthey walk away they want to “burn the house down” on their way out.They will hope backbench colleagues will follow them out the door, Westminster watchers say.Another crunch point could come ahead of a Commons vote on February  on Theresa Mays Brexit plans.Some backbenchers are reportedly planning to submit an amendment calling for a Peoples Vote, which is not sanctioned by the party leadership.Sources claim ten more Labour MPs are ready to quit and join The Independent Group, plus six Tories could join them.One senior Labour figure said: “It’s a matter of time before others go.“I think you’ll see another ten at least leave Labour in a matter of weeks.“The Independents could be the fourth biggest political party by Easter Sunday.”One insider added that he also expected Labour peers Waheed Alli, Margaret McDonagh, John Reid to sit as Independents in the Lords.In a sign of Labour’s sht under Mr Corbyn, it separately emerged on Monday, February , that s militant Derek Hatton was back as a Labour party member after a  year exile. If Labour splitters started their own party, it would likely aim for the centre-left ground formerly occupied by Tony Blairs New Labour.They would pursue social democratic policies and would be against a hard Brexit, and possibly hoping to reverse Brexit altogether.As well as Labour MPs, the breakaway party would hope to attract Lib Dems and pro-EU Tories.But they would face a struggle to make an impact as the electoral odds are against smaller and less established parties.Part of the reason is the first-past-the-post voting system in general elections, which favours the two biggest parties.In  an alliance of the SDP - formed by breakaway Labour politicians - and the old Liberal party won more than  per cent of votes nationally but only  seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then, the family say, the culprit introduced himself: he was a talking mongoose named Gef.It may sound extremely far-fetched, but in  the Irvings, who lived in a remote farmhouse called Cashens Gap on the Isle of Man, believed they were haunted by a talking mongoose.The theories that were thrown around about Gef were crazy: he was a figment of the Irvings imagination a mongoose that had been possessed by a poltergeist or a real talking animal.The story gripped the nation at the time.Several ghost hunters and journalists visited the Irvings home in an attempt to uncover the mystery, with one reporter even saying the creature had given him tips for the races.Here, Sun Online takes a look at the strange events of a mongoose, reportedly, repeatedly threatening a family, by swearing and throwing objects at them. Initially, the Irvings - Jim, Margaret and their  year old daughter Voirrey - thought the sounds coming from behind the walls were rats.Jim lay down traps and poison but the noises continued. One day, he tried to scare the creature by growling at the wall like a dog, and to his surprise it growled right back at him.Soon, it was singing nursery rhymes in an eerie, childlike manner, before coming out and introducing itself a few days later.Voirrey described the creature as being the size of a small rat, with yellow fur and a large, bushy tail.The animal said it was a mongoose called Gef, who had been born in New Delhi, India, was then hunted, before escaping to the Isle of Man.He told them he was an earthbound spirit and a ghost in the form of a mongoose. However, more chillingly, he warned that he was extra, extra clever, but not always kind.Initially, Gef assumed the role of being a pet that also took on household jobs. The Irvings said Gef guarded their house, let them know guests were arriving, told people thatone of them left the fire on, before going downstairs to put it out.However, his warnings about being cruel were right.Gef would often lose his temper at the Irvings, calling Jim a fat-headed gnome and even threatening to kill them all.Voirrey was scared of Gef and slept in her parents bed to avoid being alone in the dark with him. However, the mongoose didnt take kindly to this, telling Jim: Ill follow her wherever you put her.One night, when the family tried to barricade the bedroom door with chairs and boxes so he couldnt get in, Gef made the door bulge until it crashed open.A report in local paper alerted members of the public to the strange events and it wasnt long before paranormal investigators and national and international reporters, descended on Cashens Gap to catch a glimpse of the mysterious mongoose.Although he usually only appeared to the Irvings, a couple of reporters claimed to have seen Gef, with one even telling his boss that the creature had given him a tip for the races.Other visitors said they could hear strange voices echoing through the walls. Many paranormal investigators said this was likely to be poltergeist activity connected to teenager Voirrey.However, sceptics accused Voirrey of ventriloquism, saying the odd noises and voices seemed to come from where she was standing.And footprints, stains on the wall and hair samples claimed by the family to be concrete evidence of Gef were identied as belonging to the Irvings sheepdog, and they were accused of deception.One psychologist who staying with the Irvings for a week said he didnt believe the family were deceitful, putting Gef down to Jim having a split personality.Another theory was that the family had developed mental health problems due to their circumstances. Once rich and living in Wavertree, Liverpool, they moved to Cashens Gap after Jims piano importing business collapsed.The house had no electricity and no telephone, and the family, who didnt fit in with the locals and only had a gramophone for entertainment, were extremely isolated.In July , well-known paranormal investigator Harry Price went to Cashens Gap, and later published a book called The Haunting of Cashens Gap.He avoided saying he believed the story, and never encountered Gef himself, but also admitted that he could not find a motive for the family to have lied about the events.“I agree that the whole family must be mixed up in it but there still remains the question of motive. It certainly is not to draw people to Cashen’s Gap, because they do their utmost to keep them away…the motive for the imposture lies much deeper than mere publicity, he wrote at the time.When Jim died in , Margaret and Voirrey left their home and moved to the mainland, selling the farm to a man called Leslie Graham.Strangely, in  Leslie trapped and killed an animal that seemed to be neither ferret, stoat, nor weasel, adding that it matched descriptions of Gef.A few years on, he too left Cashens Gap, and the farmhouse was demolished.As an adult, Voirrey maintained that the familys story had been true.In , a journalist from FATE magazine tracked her down, interviewing her about her unusual experiences with Gef.Yes, there was a little animal who talked and did all those other things, she said. He said he was a mongoose and we should call him Gef... But I do wish he had let us alone.She died in , and took the real secret of Gef to the grave with her, leaving this strange tale an enduring mystery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last thing Mrs May needs now is Cabinet rebellions, backbench grandstanding and a leadership beauty contest.Too many Tories seem not to realise what damage they are doing to the party’s hard-won reputation for competence when they go completely off-grid.Or to faith in politicians and our political process in general when they fight tooth and nail to stop Brexit, but aren’t even honest about their intentions.Theresa May has a tough job for the next two weeks. The least her Party can do is let her get on with it in peace.EVERY insight into what a Corbyn government would look like makes the prospect even more terrying.This weekend he, again, brushed off the anti-Semitism in his party as a matter of personal opinion.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie.

The entertainment giant would not have let him go unless it had to.Yet Disney chief executive Bob Iger paid tribute to Lasseter, saying he had taken “breathtaking risks” in his work, “telling original, high-quality stories”.Only once he was truly gone did one staff member feel brave enough to speak openly about his reign of sexism.Graphic designer Cassandra Smolcic said: “When I started at Pixar as an intern, I thought I’d landed my dream job.But my excitement was quickly tempered by a flood of warnings about Lasseter’s touchy-feely, boundary-crossing tendencies with female employees.”She claimed he would letch after women and touch them in “unwanted” ways.Her superiors feared Lasseter might try something on with Cassandra, but rather than punishing him she says they punished her.Cassandra alleged: “Just after starting on Cars , I was told by a superior that I’d be uninvited from all our weekly art department meetings because Lasseter ‘has a hard time controlling himself’ around young women.”It is staff like Cassandra who Emma believes should be protected from Lasseter.Skydance, which has made Baywatch, several Mission: Impossible films and the two most recent Star Treks, had it written into his contract that he should behave professionally.This did not reassure Emma. She wrote: “If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for himthe only reason he’s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave ‘professionally’ ”No criminal charges were ever levelled at Lasseter.When he joined Skydance in January, he spoke to staff for  minutes, trying to reassure them he was a changed man.He also told them he was working with a therapist to help him overcome “unconscious bias”.This reflected another allegation made against him during his time at Disney — that he had promoted men rather than women.Most notably Lasseter replaced Brenda Chapman with Mark Andrews as director on Brave, even though she had come up with the idea of the Scottish princess.Female animators are far from convinced that the industry will become safer and fairer for them.Marge Dean, of pressure group Women In Animation, said after Lasseter had been given his second chance: “The announcement triggered in me the same feelings that I’ve had in abuse situations... I felt disregarded and trivialised.”For now — to paraphrase Buzz Lightyear’s catchphrase in Toy Story — it seems Lasseter’s career has already gone to infamy and beyond. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”. They know she faces another inevitable and painful leadership challenge by the end of the year — they want to see her leave with her dignity intact.It’s likely Brussels will eventually give some reassurance on the backstop.This might not quite be the full ­open-heart surgery changes to the deal some want.But the test should be whether the legal position changes. If it does, then the deal deserves to pass.And then, come the end of March, we can stop endlessly re-running referendum arguments about whether we should or shouldn’t leave the EU.We can get on with arguing about what sort of country we want to be after Brexit.We can discuss what we want to do with our newly won ­freedoms.And as a country we can start to move on together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

so they are the same gender and share identical DNA.Fraternal twins occur when each twin develops from a separate egg and the egg is fertilised by its own sperm.Dr Michael Gabbett, of Queensland University of Technology who worked alongside Prof Fisk, explained thatone egg is fertilised by two sperm it results in three sets of chromosomes, one from the mother and two from the father.He said: Three sets of chromosomes are typically incompatible with le and embryos do not usually survive.In the case of the Brisbane sesquizygotic twins, the fertilised egg appears to have equally ided up the three sets of chromosomes into groups of cells which then split into two, creating the twins.Some of the cells contain the chromosomes from the first sperm while the remaining cells contain chromosomes from the second sperm, resulting in the twins sharing only a proportion rather  per cent of the same paternal DNA.The first sesquizygotic twins were reported in the United States in .They came to doctors attention in infancy after one was identied with ambiguous genitalia.On investigation of mixed chromosomes, doctors found the boy and girl were identical on their mothers side, but shared around half of their paternal DNA.Prof Fisk said an analysis of worldwide twin databases pointed to just how rare sesquizygotic twins are.He said: We at first questioned whether there were perhaps other cases which had been wrongly classied or not reported, so examined genetic data from  fraternal twins and their parents.However we found no other sesquizygotic twins in these data, nor any case of semi-identical twins in large global twin studies.Prof Fisk added: We know this is an exceptional case of semi-identical twins.While doctors may keep this in mind in apparently identical twins, its rarity means there is no case for routine genetic testing."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000156399424.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"strictly stacey dooley slammed stereotypes uganda comic relief documentary","story":"Labour MP Mr Lammy slammed investigative reporter Stacey after she posted smiling photos with children while filming in Uganda.Stacey, , was accused of promoting unhelpful stereotypes by Mr Lammy who claimed many black Brits feel deeply uncomfortable with Comic Reliefs poverty porn.He said Stacey had failed to educate herself, adding: Her Instagram conveys the age-old trope that is her as the heroine and the black child as the victim and we have to stop it.The Strictly champ hit back at the North London MP and askedthe issue was that she was was white and that he should go over there and try to raise awareness.Comic Relief then waded in on the Red Nose row and revealed Mr Lammy, , had ignored a request to help them in Africa and the offers still open.The charity said in a statement this morning: We are really grateful that Stacey Dooley, an award-winning and internationally acclaimed documentary maker, agreed to go to Uganda to discover more about projects the British people have funded there and make no apologies for this.She has filmed and reported on challenging issues all over the world, helping to put a much-needed spotlight on issues that affect people’s lives daily.In her film, people working with or supported by Comic Relief projects tell their own stories in their own words.  We have previously asked David Lammyhe would like to work with us to make a film in Africa and he has not responded.The offer is still open.”Mr Lammy, who has been the MP for the north London borough since , said on Twitter: The world does not need any more white saviours.

New figures reveal three quarters of people who were on Support for Mortgage Interesthave been left in the lurch since the pound-a-month payment was swapped for a repayable loan. SMI was paid for decades to people on hard times to fund their mortgage interest - saving their homes from repossession. But last April the Tory government changed the benefit to a loan repayable in full, with interest, when claimants die or sell up. Now official figures show , of , former claimantshave chosen to stop SMI rather than take on new debt. Just ,have accepted the loan and ,are undecided. A further , could not be contacted.Labour branded the cut a failure and Age UK warned it may force people to cut down on heating or eating.  Charity Director Caroline Abrahams said: “People are receiving these benefits because they are on a low income. And it is unclear how people are meeting mortgage interest payments now given most have chosen not to take up the loan. We are concerned that older people affected may be facing hardship and cutting down on essentials such as heating and eating.” SMI was worth an average of pound a month for working-age claimants and pound for pensioners in  . To qualy families had to be on Income Support, Pension Credit, income-based jobseekers allowance or income-based disability benefit ESA. Almost half of claimants were pensioners.  Mike Amesbury, Shadow Employment Minister, said: The decision to convert SMI into a loan has clearly been a failure. A high proportion of SMI claimants are elderly or disabled. How they will manage without support for their housing costs is a matter of real concern and there is a real risk that they could be pushed into real hardship. The Government must get a grip and act urgently to make sure that people are not pushed into poverty because of this policy. The Department for Work and Pensions said the loan is still available to people who turned it down, and can be backdated to the date of the cut in April .A DWP spokesman said: “Support for Mortgage Interestchanges provide a safety net for homeowners from repossession and make it fair to the taxpayer who funds it. “Mortgage lenders tell us the majority of claimants who did not take out an SMI loan are meeting their mortgage commitments.”"},{"url":null,"title":"code name prince harry uses","story":"NewsCode name Prince Harry uses on nights out so people dont know who he isPrince Harry was once known as the Party Prince, and was often seen leaving nightclubs and bars in London with his friendsShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  FEB NewsPrince Harry leaving the Zefi bar in Kensington\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBeing a young adult can be tough for anyone, but it must be even more trickyyoure royal.

High profile patients like Wayne Rooney, cricket legend Shane Warne and Coronation Street star Jack P Shepherd have planted the once secret surgery firmly out in the open.The number of hair transplants has almost triped since  when just , were carried out. In  a total of , people opted to go under the kne to have their hair restored.   But it would seem some chaps are still not comfortable to admit when theyve undergone the innovative op. Dr Bessam Farjo has clinics in both Manchester and London and is one of the leading hair restoration surgeons. Speaking tohe said: There are people in the spotlight who its agreed have had some work done.In my opinion Bradley Cooper has had some very good work done on his hairline.I say the same of Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson.   John Travolta, I dont believe, has had any work done but he wears a lot of hair pieces and wigs and has recently been pictured with a shaved head. Dr Farjo believes the huge rise in the number of men opting to have the surgery, which costs around pound, in the UK, is down to a breakdown in stigma. He explained: The rise, in part, has been driven by celebrities and the general public being open about what they’ve had done. Terms like metrosexual are a little old hat now, but what began with that trend has led to procedures like this becoming more commonplace today. We are looking after ourselves more, and there is less stigma around men taking pride in their appearance.  If men don’t like something about their body, and they see ‘normal blokes’ like Wayne Rooney, James Nesbit or Shane Warne doing it, they thing ‘why not ’ And the rise in the success - and the reduction in cost - of hair transplants has also helped to break down the stigma. But the surgeon insists hair loss, or male pattern baldness, is not on the increase. More than a third of men have some kind of hair loss by the time theyre , and up to half of blokes aged . There are two manin types of transplant surgery.  The first involves surgeons reoving inidual hair follicles from the scalp using punches. The the surgeon makes microscopic slits in the receiving area of the patient’s scalp, and the inidual grafts will be placed into these sites by the doctor and his team. This is popular because it doesnt leave a hairline scar, instead just tiny dot scars. The treatment can take up to  hours and can involve , grafts in a single day. Hair starts to grow about four months after surgery and will keep growing for the next  to  months. The second involves using a thin strip skin with hair on it from somewhere  on the scalp known as the permanent area.  This is where hairs are genetically programmed to keep growing for le. It had to be done under local anaesthetic and uses high-powered microscopes to dissect the healthy hair follicles and transplant them into the area affected by hair loss. The surgery can take up to  hours and again it can take the hair four months to start to grow. But there can be risks when it comes to hair transplants, especially when people opt for a cheaper transplant abroad. Dr Farjo explained: There’s a growing number of ‘unethical’ hair restoration clinics — both here in the UK and abroad — mostly operated by non-doctors. In the worst of cases, patients attending these run the risk of becoming disfigured with an unnatural looking hairline or wasting priceless donor hair for future use.  However, we hear procedures can be sourced for as little as pound from some clinics, with many cheap operators typically located in Turkey. That may sound tempting, but it really isn’t worth the risk. In the UK, any clinic offering a hair transplant surgery must register with the Care Quality Commissionand will therefore be inspected. If a doctor operates on a patient in a non-CQC registered hair transplant clinic then they are breaking the law. Additionally, doctors in the UK must abide by strict ethical guidelines set by the General Medical Council , and must be covered by regulated liability insurers. If they breach this guidance, a patient can report them to the GMC.

The Duchess of Cambridge was smitten with James Barr and told his dad Alan: Hes gorgeous. It makes me feel broody. The mother-of-three stopped to gush over little James, telling him: Youre a very sweet little boy. On hearing he was just five and a half months, Kate beamed as she replied: Oh hes so diddy. Alan asked: Baby number four  and the Duchess of Cambridge replied with a laugh: I think William would be little worried. Kate, , also commented on a little girls coat, saying: I love your cool coat. Charlotte loves pink. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were greeted by hundreds of cheering well-wishers in Ballymena on the second day of their Northern Ireland visit.   The crowds were kept waiting for an extra  minutes for the royal arrival just before midday after William and Kate stayed late at a meeting with local police officers and staff at Hillsborough Castle. Their first engagement of the day came unannounced but was a special request by the couple to discuss the challenging roles they undertake with the Police Service Northern Ireland. A source said: William and Kate requested to meet the police officers and the staff at the PSNI to discuss the work being done to provide mental mental support for those in the service. William has spoken candidly about how he was supported during his time as an air ambulance pilot and he was very interested in the concept of sharing of ideas and experiences between all of the emergency services and armed forces so that the best results can be achieved. The Duke and Duchess had some great ideas about how that can work across the country and its something they are both passionate about.   George Hamilton, chief constable of the Police Service Northern Ireland, said: Its lovely that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge asked actually to meet police officers to get an understanding of the pressures that theyre under and of what were doing from an occupational health perspective. They were really interested about the pressures and stresses of policing in Northern Ireland. The staff certainly appreciated the opportunity to talk to their royal highnesses. The couple then travelled the  miles to visit the Braid Arts Centre in Ballymena. Before meeting young people working with Cinemagic - a charity that uses film, TV and digital technologies to inspire and educate locals - they took part in a  minute walkaboutgreetedby several hundred people lining the streets of the Co Antrim town.

The -year-old masterpiece, named Lost Caravaggio, underwent a two year restoration before going on display at P  DColnaghi Co art dealership this morning in St Jamess, London. The incredibly well-preserved canvas shows the beheading of Assyrian general Holofernes by Judith, from the apocryphal Book of Judith. Judith was a widow from the city of Bethulia, under siege by the Holofernes army. To save her city, she seduced the general in his tent before beheading him, which the painting depicts.   The masterpiece is believed to be the work of great Renaissance master Caravaggio and is thought to have been painted between  and  Caravaggio is said to have died from gradual poisoning from the lead in his paint at the age of  in . His use of shadows and radiant light is thought to have led to the renowned Baroque style that flourished for  more years and the inspiration behind Rembrandts artwork.   Some in the art world disputed the authenticity of the painting - believing it instead to be a fine copy produced by one of his Flemish disciples. One such artist considered was Louis Finson who was a recognised artist in his own right but owned and often reproduced Caravaggios work.  But the gallery has insisted the work is indeed Caravaggios and said it has been confirmed by a number of scientic analyses and supported by the results of a recent light cleaning of the old nish. The painting will be exhibited in London, Paris, New York and Toulouse before being sold at auction in Toulouse on June  this year, in collaboration with the art appraisal firm Cabinet Turquin.

Dave Hazel, , was set to marry his online lover Linda Smith but ended up being scammed out of his le savings. The warehouse worker met Linda on a dating site in  and spent a year chatting online and speaking to her on the phone. After falling head over heels, Dave was convinced she was going to move from Canada to the UK to be with him. But he was soon embroiled in a web of lies with his online lover demanding more and more money from him.   Dave, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk, quickly forked out his entire le savings of pound, but soon after realised Linda was based in Ghana, Africa. She then cut all contact with him and completely disappeared. Singleton Dave, who wanted to start a family with Linda, is now speaking out for the first time about being scammed online. He said: After losing almost pound, I was heartbroken - I had been ready to start a family with Linda. I had been speaking to her online for  months but despite not meeting her or using Skype, we had spoken on the phone.   I met her on a dating site and she looked like someone Id met in London and she said she remembered meeting me. We began building up a relationship, having conversations daily - she introduced herself as Linda Smith. I even rang her and she spoke with an accent that sounded more English than Canadian. Before I knew it, I was falling for her - my heart had melted and she was lovely. She wanted to live with me and I thought I was in love. Dave made arrangements to meet Linda, but things started to unravel and she quickly started demanding more funds. The bachelor said: The first thing she asked me for was a VISA costing pound. I was ready to have a full relationship, and I was happy to help her.  She asked me to send it through Moneygram - which works almost like PayPal and two weeks after that it was another pound for a medical check. She said she would marry me and have children - she was promising everything Id always wanted. Yet Daves dream was about to be destroyed as the money requests kept coming in, eventually reaching more than pound,. Dave paid for what he believed were plane tickets, visa complications and more - fully believing she was on her way to finally meet him. Yet his suspicions were finally aroused when she asked for flight tickets from Ghana. Dave said: I thought she was coming from Canada but when I asked for proof of the tickets they said she was coming from Ghana.  I asked her to explain - and she said shed just been visiting. But then I got a phone call from immigration in Ghana after shed been detained for having a large amount of money on her person. They told me the person I was waiting for wasnt coming and was being arrested. Dave decided it was time to investigate properly, a staggering two years after hed first spoken to Linda. Upon visiting his local bank, it was quickly discovered that all the paperwork, which showed email correspondence between Dave and Linda and evidence of where Dave had sent his money to, proved Dave had been victim of a scam.  Staff also told him there was no way he could get his money back, as he had voluntarily sent it and it couldnt be traced. Dave added: It was the darkest period of my le - I asked themthey were joking, I couldnt have been conned. I didnt trust anyone and couldnt speak to anyone for months. Without Victim Support - a service which offers initial support and information to victims of crimes like mine, and assessed your needs going forward - I wouldnt be here. Ive learnt you should always ask for advice, andyoure sending money without seeing them, stop. Dont be ashamed - youre not the only one - these cons left me heartbroken and its taken me years to fix things.

The mum-of-two appeared on Channel s Skint Britain: Friends Without Benefits where she tried to secure a lease so she regain custody of her children. She broke down in tears as she told of how struggled to cope on the new benefits system and ended up living back her with her mum - where they share a bed. In the documentary, Jayde is seen trying to convince landlord Kevin to rent her a two-bed property.   Kevin tells her that is already owed pound, in rent from others on Universal Credit and is reluctant to take her on. Under the new benefits system, rent is paid directly to the claimant rather than to the landlord directly. In the clip, Kevin asks Jayde: Do you have any issues, any rent arrears  Jayde shares her head but her mum Mandy looks sheepish and it soon emerges that Jayde did not pay her previous landlord. Kevin called him and was told: We havent been paid a single penny.   Shes had the money given to her but shes spent it. Nothing from the day she moved in. Ive saved you a lot of f*****g heartache my mate. Jayde starts sobbing as he rejects her application meaning she will have to continue living with her mum. Her children are living with their dad and she has no chance of getting them back without securing a lease. She says: Its just a losing battle. I do regret not paying rent. I shouldve been responsible paying my rent. But I didnt have my kids with me so I was just like lets get drunk. Like forget everything. I spent all my rent money on drink. I went through quite a bad stage to be fair, and I didnt think I had depression, but I clearly did. A single system replacing six benefits: Child and Working Tax Credits, Housing Benefits, Income Support, Jobseekers’ Allowance, and Employment and Support Allowance. It was launched in  as the pet project of Tory Iain Duncan Smith supposedly to make work pay. Who claims it  Low earners, those out of work and the sick or disabled. Already , people are on UC - % of benefit claimants. It is being rolled out to inidual Jobcentres including  in October . What are the problems  Debt-ridden claimants must wait six weeksfor their first payment, with % waiting longer than that and % waiting ten weeks in late . Research also suggests overall, UC leaves many working families worse off than the old system. That is because payments taper away at p for every pound claimants earn. The timetable has also been put back nine times since  after a string of glitches and will only be fully complete in late . Jayde tells of her now she now receives a single person benefit because of children are with their dad. She cannot afford to rent a suitable property on her current allowance. They say get a house back you can have your kids back, she says. I can have a house but I cant get the f*****g rent for it cos I dont have my kids. So how am I supposed to get a house  Despite her tough circumstances, Jayde is determined to get her kids back. She says: If I didnt sleep at my mums I would have nowhere whatsoever to go. Im sharing a bed with my mum. Im a -year-old who has to cuddle my mum on a night. Its bad, its terrible. Ive been in a massive ditch for months and Im nearly out of it.  The only way Im getting out of this ditch is by getting a house to be fair, and then Ill be back on the straight and narrow. I hate being on benefits. By next year I dont want to be on benefits. I worked in a care home. I worked in a hotel doing house keeping and receptions. Ive worked in a fish shop. Ive just done all sorts really. I want a house so I can make it mine and my kids home again. Her mum Mandy also said the unfair system makes it so much harder for Jayde to get on her feet. Shes trying her hardest to get a house through here, she says. They just keep knocking her back. They just keep kicking her in the teeth every time shes trying. By the end of the episode, Jayde secures a property as a landlord agrees to let her a property at a reduced rate so she can get her children back.  She will pay pound per week but her rent will increase when she is back on the higher rate of Universal Credit. It feels like a weights been lted off my shoulders. I can start looking forward to having the kids, she says. Ive started doing a distance learning course in adult social care. Obviously,I get a job I wont need Universal Credit. Ill be able to pay bills on time.

They now want to warn others after their two-year-old son could have been blinded and had to spend four days in hospital last month. Lorna Hoy, , and Andy Briggs, , first noticed small red spots forming on their son Kalos face, chest and arm. After being dismissed twice by doctors, Lorna claims it wasnt until their third attempt to seek medical advice their concerns were taken seriously. Kalo tested positive for the herpes simplex virus - something doctors suggest he caught through kissing an infected adult.  The mum-of-four is now sharing her story to raise awareness for the virus, which,not treated, can be fatal in children. Thankfully Kalo has since made a full recovery after his time in hospital. Lorna, from Salford, Manchester said: I never thought this would happen to our family. Kalo had red spots all over this face, chest and arm before he was diagnosed with herpes. He had ulcers in his mouth and needed injections in his eyes to ensure the infection hadnt spread to them as this couldve blinded him. I have heard of babies dying from catching this virus which is awful and I think the only reason Kalo survived is because he was just under two at time.   I hope our story serves as a warning to other parents as it could happen to anyone. Kissing children on their mouths and sharing cutlery is a common way to catch herpes, as its spread through saliva. Kalo - who was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester on January  - needed an intense course of IV antibiotics in a bid to rid him of the infection. Andy, a bus driver, added: Kalo had struggled to eat days before his diagnosis which was a real worry for us as parents.  But thanks to the amazing care of the doctors and nurses he began eating yogurts as he began to recover.Lorna shared the pictures of Kalo via Facebook to raise awareness for the infection and it went viral.We want to encourage people to research the virus and look into its causes to prevent their children from going through what Kalo did. The couple who have three other children, Jayden, eight, Kaci, six and Jenson, four, and hope the pictures of Kalos face will help raise awareness. Lorna said: Since getting home has been getting along great and is finally back to his good self however the scars have remained on his face from the sores he had while in hospital.  We would all like to say thanks to the staff who cared for Kalo in one way or another at Wythenshawe Hospital. As a family never thought this would happen to us but were so lucky that Kalo pulled through after his treatment. I hope through sharing our experiences of it that we prevent others from going through the same.

Forecasters were expecting the desert cloud to dump blood-red rainfall as the dust mixes with droplets in the air in the wake of a record-breaking C heatwave. Pollution warnings were issued as the cloud was blown , from North Africa to Britain, covering parts of the country on what was dubbed Toxic Wednesday. The dust cloud has been hanging around for days due to high pressure in the atmosphere - creating Britains worst smog for a year - and it was expected to drop orange or red-tinged rain on homes and cars on Thursday after colliding with a weather front moving in from the Atlantic.   It could leave a layer of dust, leading to concerns for people with breathing dficulties. Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell told MailOnline: Through satellite imagery we have been able to see the dust showing up, particularly across Scotland. This is due to our having winds coming up from the south, which has brought the dust our way from North Africa. Some of this [rain] may fall [Thursday], and often when it does people will see it on their cars.  The Met Office said possibly heavy and thundery showers will spread from Wales into England amid cooler temperatures on Thursday, with patchy evening rain later and strong winds in the south. Heavy rain will move into Northern Ireland and spread to the far west of Britain on Friday. Wet and windy weather is expected through the weekend, with gales of up to mph, and into next week. Monday will be largely cloudy, wet and windy with showers or longer spells of rain for many, and possibly some hill snow, although details are still uncertain, the Met Office said. It added: Spells of wet and windy weather are likely to continue through the rest of the week, interspersed with some drier, brighter periods.   The conditions will be a big contrast to the sunny start to the week, said forecaster Becky Mitchell, adding: It will be wet and windy for the whole of the UK, and very strong winds across many places, and we could even have gales in the west. Meanwhile, with just one day left the current month is on course to be the warmest February since records began. The previous warmest February was in , when the average maximum daily temperature was .C. This years maximum daily average has already reached .C, the Met Office said. Ms Mitchell said it would be exceptional to beat the  record given the chilly start to the month.  She said: At the moment, the current average is .C and of course we have got just one more day of February to go, so it looks like we are on track to be the warmest February on record. Ms Mitchell added: It was really quite cold at the start of the month - its pretty exceptional to have caught up with the  one. Experts said climate change is heating up the whole weather system and making extremes more likely. Februarys exceptional conditions have seen fires at Arthurs Seat in Edinburgh, on Saddleworth Moor in West Yorkshire and in North Wales, Sussex and Lancashire. The warmest winter temperatures on record were measured on Monday and Tuesday, with C at Kew Gardens in London, as temperatures beat the previous record of .C in Greenwich, south-east London, in . UK five-day weather forecast Thursday Fog patches will linger at first, particularly in Northern Ireland. Morning sunshine is likely in eastern England. It will be cooler and cloudier than recently, and breezier in the south. Showery rain, possibly heavy, will spread from Wales into England.  Thursday night Patchy evening rain, particularly in England and Wales, will gradually disperse and the UK will stay mostly cloudy and relatively mild overnight. Hill fog will persist, particularly in the north. Friday Friday will be cloudy with a few patches of light rain or drizzle. Heavier rain will move into Northern Ireland and spread to the far west of Britain later. Saturday to Monday Rain and strong winds arriving from the west later on Saturday. Sunday bright and breezy, with gales likely in Scotland and rain in the south. Sunshine and showers Monday. Wet and windy weather - and snow - next week Here is the Met Offices outlook for Monday to Wednesday  March: Monday will be largely cloudy, wet and windy with showers or longer spells of rain for many, and possibly some hill snow, although details are currently uncertain. The best of any drier weather will probably be in the north. Spells of wet and windy weather are likely to continue through the rest of the week, interspersed with some drier, brighter periods. Further strong winds and gales are likely in exposed areas, particularly in the northwest. Temperatures will be near or slightly below normal for the start of spring, perhaps temporarily milder as weather fronts move across. On high ground in the north, it may be cold enough for some snow to fall, and there is the continued threat of overnight frosts where skies clear.

The killer, of Stamford, Connecticut, was allowed to admit first-degree manslaugher, even though Bella’s death was ruled a homicide by blunt force trauma to the head. Police have not shared further information on how Bella came to acquire the two skull fractures, the Stamford Advocate said. Sentencing, Judge Gary White suggested that Bella had died due to her babysitter’s carelessness, saying: Nobody is saying this defendant intentionally harmed this victim.   But it was her recklessness and misconduct that this child died. Despite admitting causing Bella’s death last year Carillo-Maldonado declared I did nothing wrong’ during the sentencing hearing. That prompted a judge to consider rejecting her plea. She did not address the court or offer an apology to her young victim’s parents, NewsCT reported.   The parentsattorney Mark Sherman said: Theyre appalled that there was no contrition, no remorse, no Im sorry, Theyre grateful to the police, states attorney, for working on this case for three years.It was a challenging case because there was no acceptance of responsibility by the defendant. Carrillo-Maldonado pleaded guilty under the Alford doctrine, which means she does not agree with the facts of the case, but admits theres enough evidence to convict her. She has never said exactly what happenedtoBella.

This is because staff at a branch of the chain Sonic Drive-In had walked out on their jobs and left a rather explicit note in the window revealing why. In the A message, the Ex Sonic Crew members said they refused to work for the company any longer, claiming it all came down to terrible management following the recent sale of the business. According to Now, the company went under new management on February .   But clearly staff werent impressed with their new bosses and werent afraid to tell them so, sticking the brutal letter up for all to see. It reads: Warning, due to terrible management the whole store has quit. The company has been sold to people that dont give a f*** about anyone but themselves. They apologised for any inconvenience their actions caused before explaining why they had to leave.   Our team refuses to work for a company that treats their employees like they are s*** when they have put everything into this store. We have worked too hard for too long. We are all off to better things. They added: So to the new owners, F*** YOU! Sincerely, Ex Sonic Crew. And according to reports, these staff members werent the only ones who walked out, with teams at two other Sonic Drive-In locations believed to have followed suit.   Scioto Post reports workers at the Lancaster Sonic also left a note, but it was much tamer, saying: goodbye and thank you, next. Sources close to the situation told the publication that part of the dispute was caused by pay cuts, which allegedly saw wages reduced from minimum wage to just an hour. Its currently unclear when the stores will re-open, but another branch in the area has reportedly closed for good. A Sonic spokesperson told WSYX: Under new management, guests and the community can look forward to improved service and the famous food, beverages and treats for which Sonic is known. Employees working for the local drive-in can look forward to fun, fast-paced work on which they can build a career,they choose. Most current employees will have the opportunity to continue to work at the drive-in under the new ownership. Sonic Communications manager Kyle Lankford added: No wage rates at any level have been decreased in this transition’. He added that workers often receive tips.

For nearly a decade, the lump on -year-old Barbs back has continued to grow. The Calornian woman said: “It was probably the size of a small peach or a plum, and now it’s across my whole back and it’s probably more like the size of a cantaloupe. “It’s very uncomfortable. “My bra strap hits it just at the perfect angle where it’s painful.   It feels like jelly or something in there. The location of it is right on my spine and down the middle of the my back, and that concerns me.” Thinking that the lump was related to being overweight, Barb consulted her doctor before making an amazing transformation. After the lump was diagnosed as a lipoma, Barb underwent gastric bypass surgery, and has lost an incredible lbs in just one year.   But her lipoma didn’t decrease in size. I thought it would shrink down, but that’s not the case. It was starting to grow and get bigger. I was really hoping that I could just look good in my clothes and I don’t. I just want to feel like I thought I would feel, and that is beautul and comfortable and like there wouldn’t be something dferent about me still. And that’s upsetting.”  Barb paid a visit to Dr Sandra Lee - known as Dr Pimple Popper- to get rid of the lump forever. Dr Lee said: “What I really love about Barbara is her fun personality. “But I can tell that this lipoma really does bother her deep down inside.” Taking Barb straight into surgery, Dr Lee numbed the area and cut straight into the cm-wide bump, before wrestling to the pull it free from Barb’s body.

However a new study brings bad tidings for everyone . Researchers from the University of Warwick studied the sleep patterns of , German parents with a child born between  and .   They found that mums lost the most sleep, reporting that this amounted to an hour of sleep in the first three months, and then  minutes of sleep every night in their childs first year. Breastfeeding mums were found to get the worst sleep. While they werent as adversely affected as mums, dads too suffer from a lack of sleep -  minutes in the first three months after birth.   But the real bad news comes in answer to the when will my child sleep through the night  question. Neither mums nor dads said their sleep recovered for up to SIX YEARS after the birth of their first child. Thats six years of disturbed, broken, shallow sleep. Six years of relying heavily on caffeine, of eye bags, grey skin, low energy levels and a general sense of always being knackered. While having children is a major source of joy for most parents it is possible that increased demands and responsibilities associated with the role as a parent lead to shorter sleep and decreased sleep quality even up to  years after birth of the first child, authorSakari Lemola ofthe University of Warwick said in a statement.

Burglars broke into the home and stole items including bottles of perfume but left the painting as they thought it worthless, according to auctioneer Marc Labarbe. The work, called Judith And Holofernes and valued at pound million, sat for a century in anonymity against a wall between old clothes, family antiques and crockery.   The painting of the beheading of a man by a woman has undergone a two year restoration and is set to be sold at auction in June. Speaking at the unveiling of the work at the Colnaghi gallery, Mr Labarbe joked the burglars had not deemed the painting adequate enough to steal it. He said: One of my clients was clearing his attic and he needed two men to help him. It took a year to sell all the antiquities. Clocks, toys, pieces of religion, in good and bad condition, clothes, crockery, as well as many things of no interest. Everything was very dusty. I have to tell you that a few years before, burglars broke into the attic and stole many things, included eau de parfum bottles. Fortunately, our painting was not adequate.   He added: On the rd of April , late in the morning, my client called me again because he had found a painting and wanted my opinion on it. I went to his house and climbed the stairs to the landing of the attic where the painting was displayed. At this moment there was what was like a fog across the whole canvas. The painting was blurry and it was almost impossible to see the details, but I was impressed by the state of the composition.  According to Paris-based art appraiser Eric Turquin, the work was painted in . It depicts the biblical tale of Judith, a widow from the city of Bethulia, who breaks the siege of her home by seducing the Assyrian leader and beheading him. It will be sold without reserve on June  in Toulouse at the La Halle aux Grains, with Mr Labarbe saying: This magnicent story began in Toulouse. It has to continue in Toulouse. The painting is Caravaggios second version of the same subject, with the first painted in Rome around .

The distraught child can be seen bursting into tears and holds her bleeding head, in shocking CCTV from inside the playroom. The tot was taken by ambulance and spent three days at the hospital recovering, but needs plastic surgery on the deep cut. Shockingly her parents were told the little girl fell on a report written by the worker at the nursery, in Missouri, USA.   They demanded to see the CCTV footage, unable to understand how her injury could have been so severe. According to ABC News, the director of the Brighter Daycare and Preschool viewed the tape with the parents five days after the incident and immediately fired the employee. The familys lawyer, Jenner Hansen said: They did their research, they went to a daycare that they thought was safe and they left their child with people they paid to keep them from harm. They couldnt have foreseen that a day care worker could do what they did to their daughter. The reason that theyve come forward is because they are concerned that what happened to their daughter could very well happen to any other child.   Ms Hansen added: The family requested they look at the surveillance video because they had trouble understanding how their daughter could sustain such a severe injury as a result of a fall. They only then learned that what had been called a fall was actually an assault. Sgt Kevin Smith of the North County Police Cooperative told ABC News that while reviewing the video of the incident, police discovered a second incident where a dferent child at the day care center was injured by a worker. He said that in the other incident, a worker grabbed the child by the arm so hard that the employees fingernails punctured the childs skin and left bruising.   He said both incidents remain under investigation and police plan to present evidence within two weeks to the St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, who will decide whether to file criminal charges against both employees. Both workers were sacked and no longer work at the nursery. The family has removed their daughter and son from the facility.

Lilibeth Bustamante asked the youngster to go with her to a shop and it was only when a neighbour stepped in to intervene as the woman grabbed the little girls arm that she was saved. The terrying incident took place in Paranaque City, the Philippines, on February .And this latest attempted abduction is one of the reasons the country is becoming known as one of the kidnapping capitals of the world.  In one year alone  people were abducted and both the US and British embassies have warned tourists travelling to the Philippines to be vigilent in light of the kidnapping threat.Bustamante was arrested after the concerned neighbour called the police and she told officers the terrying way the kidnapping gangs operate.The gangs snatch children and then sell them on the black market to become sex slaves. Bustamante, who says she was paid just pound: to carry out the abduction, claimed she worked with other women to kidnap children from the streets. She said: I only take them, they sell. They only give me one thousand pesos. I send it to my family in Mindoro.   The alleged kidnapper then claimed the gang would sell the children - both boys and girls - to foreign buyers who would often have sex with the youngsters while streaming it online anc charging people to watch. The children sell for as little as pound,. Bustamante said: We have a quota of two children per week. Our target age is -years-old and above. They require us to take good-looking children. They get , to , pesos depending on their looks. My cut is , pesos. Bustamante said that she had taken dozens of children since she joined the gang last year.  She added: We operate inManila and nearby towns. We dont stop until we reach our quota. Rudy Dimson , from the Parantildeaque Police Women and Children Protection Desk said: We are currently investigating the case. We want to look for other victims of this group. We urge the parents with missing children to come here. Several days after Bustamante was detained, police arrested a second woman after she was caught allegedly trying to abduct a young girl.\u2028 Locals surrounded her and called police who arrested her on suspicion of attempted child abduction in Batasan Hills district of Quezon City inManila.  And children are not the only victims of the kidnapping gangs. Militant groups are also targeted wealthy Filipinos as well as visitors. In June last year the New Peoples Army abducted a soldier while the militant Abu Sayyaf Groupsnatched the relatives of one of the countrys politicians. The most common place for tourists to be kidnapped is in the south of the country and travellers from China, Europe, Australia and America are the most likely targets. People are even being snatched from resorts and beaches by pirates.  Many of those abducted are ed uninjured but increasingly bold ransom and even terror demands mean some have been beheadedthese are not met. Last year  people believed to be membes of the ASG were convicted of kidnapping dozens of school pupils, teachers and a catholic priest in the militant groups worst ever abduction. Two of the teachers were beheaded and the priest also died while he was in captivity following the abduction in . Senior State Prosecutor Peter Ong said at the time: The persistence and determination of the court to give justice to the victims and those who were wrongfully arrested led to this decision, although it took more than one and a half decades to happen. In  a plot by the ASG to kidnap tourists on Bohol Island was foiled by authorities.  They hunted those responsible down in a dramatic speedboat chase and nine militants were killed along with three soldiers and once police officer. And last year a -year-old Japanese man was rescued by police after he was kidnapped in the Philippines. He was found in a house outside Manila. In  Kjartan Sekkingstad from Norway was kidnapped along with two Canadian men and a Filipina woman. This was one of the highest profile hostage for ransom cases in the country. Robert Hall was one of the three men kidnapped by the ASG. He spent nine months in captivity but was beheaded on September , .  Sekkingstad managed to escape when the Philippines military forces launched a surprise assault on the militant group responsible in the dead of night. The then -year-old fled through the jungles in the Sulu province to safety. But as he raced away from the scene of his captivity he stumbled across Canadian John Ridsdel, who he had become close to in their long months as hostages. Ridsdel was suffering from a broken rib so Sekkingstad carried him back to their captors. Just  hours later, Ridsdel, a father-of-two, was led away to be beheaded. Sekkingstad was finally freed almost a year after he was kidnapped.  The message from the embassy here in the UK is clear - there is a heightened risk of kidnapping in the Philippines. A spokesman said: There has been an increase in kidnapping of foreign nationals, including attacks targeting foreigners and tourists since late . Terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals in the Philippines. However, since the ASGs leader, Isnilon Hapilon, died in October  the group has been fractured and less organised. The number of kidnappings fell last year compared to .

their dismal home form continued with a - loss to relegation- battling Hamilton.He has warned that fight mustfor the Pittodrie quarter-final with the Gers.Aberdeen go into the cup tie amid a concerning home slump with just two points from the last .McInnes warned Aberdeen’s season hinges on solving their home hurt against an in-form Rangers side that has hit  goals in three games.Aberdeen also suffered an injury blow with left back Max Lowe coming off injured and he will be a doubt for the cup tie.McInnes said: “There has to be more aggression in our game from the start.“We cannot just pick and choose when that aggression comes.“It has to be there in every game, certainly the game against Rangers will demand it.“There is no doubt our home form has to improve for us to achieve what we want to achieve.“Certainly now on Sunday going into the cup gamewe want to make sure we are in with a chance of winning a cup and get into the semi-final we have to make sure there is more aggression in our performance.“Against Hamilton while there was no shortage of effort there was a shortage of aggression and confidence, especially once the second goal went in.“We are all responsible and we should all expect better.“It looked to me that Hamilton were the team with the biggest cause.“That shouldn’t be the case as we want to do as well as we can.“That was the most disappointing thing.”Aberdeen have taken just one point from back to back home games against the Premiership’s bottom sides, St Mirren and Hamilton.They were held - to bottom outfit St Mirren in the previous match at Pittodrie.Amidst the home slump since the turn of the year the Dons also drew - with Stenhousemuir, the team bottom of League One, in cup action.McInnes apologized to fans for another home howler.He said: “I am bitterly disappointed as we should all expect more from an Aberdeen team.“The supporters should expect more from ourselves.“We expect far more from ourselves.“We can only apologize to the supporters for the level of performance.“There is a demand here and you have to deal with that and we have for the last six years.“We want players who are brave enough to get on the ball whether it is - or we are behind.“While still having the confident to make things happen and we were miles away from that in terms of taking that responsibility.“I think the players are honest enough andthey are honest enough with themselves they will say they fell way short of what is expected.”Aberdeen’s defensive jinx struck yet again as on loan Derby County left-back Max Lowe had to leave the pitch injured after just  minutes.That came less than  hours after the Dons secured Greg Halford from the free agent market as emergency cover to strengthen the defence.Halford has previously played for Sunderland, Wolves and Cardf City – he was an unused substitute against Hamilton.Defender Halford, , was signed in reaction to the injuries to right back Shaleum Logan and on loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban.Logan is out for two to three months having undergone ankle surgery.Hoban is set to undergo cruciate ligament surgery and is out for the season.On Lowe, McInnes said: “It was enough for him to come off which puts him in doubt for Sunday.”Hamilton went ahead in the first half with a magnicent goal from George Oakley from near the byline.They secured the points to move them further clear of the immediate relegation spot through Mickel Miller in the second half.McInnes said: “I have got to praise Hamilton for their part in it as they played well.“The team with the more aggression won the game.“It is a reminder to my players that while there is plenty of effort and running about you cannot just win a game based on your quality.“There are so many other factors needed to win a game.“We were unconvincing from the off in terms of defending and gave them one or two opportunities to keep them interested.“The last  minutes of the first half we played well and were unfortunate not to get the equalizer.“We asked the players to go and deliver a second half full of confidence with more aggression and intent.“We got that for spells at the start of the second half and passed up a few chances.“There were enough chances to win the game, that is clear.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/5c6ba78c971af5.26783470-848x564.jpg ","title":"campaigners calling for return of gatwick flights welcome new

However within a few minutes Star nicked the ball off them and a quick exchange of passes saw Caskie in a position to play a nice through ball for Aitken score with a controlled finish. Despite playing against a strong wind Star were looking the stronger team at this point and a shot from Paterson whizzed past the post. Green was also causing problems down the right for Shettleston. A second goal arrived for Star with McMurchy scoring. Eventually Shettleston started to claw their way back into the game scoring first with a wind assisted  yard free kick and then reacting first to a bouncing ball. Half time -.With the wind in the second half Star started strongly and took the lead again through McMurchy.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency glasgow prestwick airport cessna","story":"NewsEmergency at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as Cessna plane overshoots runway after engine failureThe incident saw a Cessna  overshoot the runway following the loss of engine power.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn emergency was declared at Prestwick Airport this afternoon after a light aircraft overshot the runway.

The massive clear-out included giving away box loads of coat hangers. The building closes after  years of trading after current multi-millionaire owners the Jebreel family pulled the rug.

Its tearooms, smoking rooms and roof gardens became famed across the country. In April  the business was acquired by the House of Fraser group and in the years following, ious changes took place, both in nameand in ownership. Hourstons Ltd was formed in  by Isaac and Helen Jebreel of Hampstead, London. The store’s Facebook site says: “Hourstonshas been a retail beacon on the high street for generations, everyone has a story or memory in connection with the place” Shoppers shared their memories on its Facebook site this week.

The pound million screw will be positioned right on the old mill weir on the River Ayr opposite Ayrshire College. The weir originally drove an old cornmill on the site. Now tens of thousands of pounds a year will be generated by the flow of the river. Updated plans are now being considered by South Ayrshire Council, which is behind the scheme through the local Energy Agency. They show a single archimedes screw turbine at the old Nethermills Weir. Consultants Mann Power Hydro say: “Completion of this project will create a supply of renewable energy into the local distribution network, proposing firstly to sell the majority of output locally to meet the electricity demands of Ayrshire College, where the grid connection will be made. “In mitigation, the project includes a historic improvement to the passage of eels, lampreys and salmon smolts at the weir by the provision of new specialised passes for these species, and also improves upstream and downstream migration for salmon and other fish species. “It will moderate the flows into the existing passes in some conditions, which will make these less challenging. “This will help ameliorate a general problem whereby a weir is a barrier to migration of fish.” It is predicted the turbine - more than  feet in diameter and  feet long - will generate up to  kilowatts per year. The blade will turn at a maximum  revolutions per minute The Energy Agency carried out a study last year to estimate the energy potential passing over the weirs at Nethermills. It is expected the council will pocket pound, a year from selling the power and the scheme would receive a pound, feed-in-tarf. The single four-bladed screw is enough to power  homes. A report said: “With proper maintenance the scheme should continue to generate clean power for many decades after its capital cost has been repaid. “The scheme would provide an eye-catching and interesting landmark in the middle of the town, an emblem of the community’s dedication to the principle of sustainable development.

Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story. Go find the Kingrsquos Chair for yourself and see what your imagination comes up with!"},{"url":null,"title":"double-cash-boost-for-our-community-kitchen-project-in-haddington","story":"Our Community Kitchen has been awarded more than pound,, which it will use over the next year.The bulk of the money has come from Big Lottery Scotland, with pound, awarded to see the group expand to three days a week from next month.Already, the project meets on a Tuesday at Haddington Bowling Club.In the coming weeks, it will also meet on a Wednesday and Thursday, hosting dozens of people at each session and serving a hearty three-course meal for a donation of pound.Elaine Gale, spokeswoman for the project, felt Our Community Kitchen was well on the road to being a success.She said: ldquoIt is so exciting for the area and just to see where we go next.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

As a frequent stand-in host on BBC Radio Scotland morning shout-fest, Call Kaye, you could see why he had been given the gig.Magic or mince  You decideDebate Night made the news before last night when it emerged the budget for the show was so small it could not afford to move around the country, like QT. Whatever they have spent the money on, it is not the set. With its purple chairs and faux art it looked like the business class lounge of a cheapo airline. The audience were in cinema-style banked seating which made the audience look tiny. Worse, some of the seats were empty.But never mind the standard of the seating, what about the quality of the debate  The audience, Jardine informed us, came from all across Scotland, ldquofrom Ayrshire to Paisley, Perth and Edinburgh. In other words, from a bus ride away.On the  were three politicians, Deputy FM John Swinney, Labourrsquos Monica Lennon, and Murdo Fraser for the Scottish Conservatives, and two civilians, the poet Jenny Lindsay and the entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter. Two women to three men, or two to fouryou count Jardine: some things never change. No Greens or LibDems will it be their turn next week Marks out of  for The Nine The job of the new show, Jardine said in his introduction, was not just to get answers from politicians but to raise the standard of debate, no less. Within a minute, however, Murdo Fraser was talking over Monica Lennon and she was raising her own voice in response. So much for new standards of discourse. It was not long, either, before the politicians on the  began answering the questions that suited them rather than the ones they had been asked. Jardine pulled a Paxman now and then, possibly to shake himself awake. ldquoWhat does any of this mean, what are you going to do about it  he asked Lennon at one point.Half an hour was spent on Brexit, far too long. The next questions, on sectarianism and a possible teachersrsquo pay strike, were not matters that would have been raised on a QT from London, so in that respect Debate Night showed its worth, evennothing new emerged in the discussion.I would like to say the hour was packed with penetrating questions and illuminating answers, a show that showed QT how such programmes should be done. There were one or two moments worth catching, most of them coming from plain-speaking Sir Tom Hunter, but by and large this was a punishing watch, not least because of the late slot. An .pm finish, on a school night  Why bother committing to a serious programmeit doesnrsquot have a credible chance of building an audience By the time Jardine said goodnight it was time for this Cinderella to head to bed. Cinders at least had her slipper ed those  minutes spent watching Debate Night are never coming back."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-does-brendan-rodgers-celtic-exit-prove-loyalty-is-an-outdated-concept","story":"And already the Parkhead faithful are throwing adjectives such as ldquobetrayal around like pennies at a Sixties scramble.:Rodgers legacy in danger of being reframed as the Brendan Fraudgers era by the Celtic supportBut what of loyalty  Should we hold it up to be a virtue, or an anachronism thatrsquos headed right for the lexicon bin marked Outdated The past two decades has seen the concept tested to the limit. New Labour introduced the notion of a wandering minstrel society, where workers were free to ply their trade wherever. If poets and pop stars could do it, why not the rest of us  The problem was as economies constricted so too did employment contracts of any real value.Try telling a delivery bike rider out there right now they should show company loyalty and theyrsquoll force a  inch Hawaiianndash with fries ndash right down your throat. Yes, there was a time when trades unions had the power to look after their charges. But that day has passed, public sector apart.Is loyalty about reciprocity  Yes, it should be part of a two-way process. Sadly, however, the public has for decades shown blind faith to banks and energy companies who have refused to pass savings onto those who built up their business. So itrsquos only right we have become promiscuous, learned to compare the market because the truth is wersquove been so royally shafted in the past.The concept of loyalty has long been fostered by elites, by way of control, at times, to protect institutions that are morally corrupt. Itrsquos been bred into us, from days in the Brownies or Boys Brigade, to respect and support a higher order. Thatrsquos not to say order is a bad thing but that order has to co-exist alongside morality of purpose. Herersquos a good rule of thumb:loyalty demands the swearing of an oath or any weird ritualistic practice, then walk away.:Brendan Rodgers leaves Celtic for Leicester CityItrsquos not hard to see why Scots MP Ian Murray MP wonrsquot sign a loyalty statement to his boss. Politics now is defined by continuous acts of disloyalty. Agreements, to party and electorate are reconfigured almost on a daily basis. Andloyalty is being redefined in terms of allegiance to solid principle, thatrsquos not a bad thing. However, the opposite is also true we can only wonder and worry whatrsquos going on in Jeremy Corbynrsquos mind that allows him to block plans to ban Hezbollah from Britain. Whatrsquos going on in Theresa Mayrsquos head that allows for disloyalty to the truth, which is that we wonrsquot walk away with a deal on March  We can only wonder what is going on the head of Pope Francis, given his close confidante and Vatican No was allowed to practice evil for many years. What of the notion of loyalty between friends  Irsquove long thought this to be an essential, an unconditional. Unless friends bring with them new conditions under which you struggle to operate but we should see loyalty as the perpetual ideal.Yet, the Pope and politics apart, were moving towards a society whereby the core value of loyalty has less importance. Wersquore living in a world where Cha goalkeepers can refuse to be substituted, which begs the question: where do we draw the line in refusing to take orders  Should a soldier be jailed for refusing to listen to an officer, no matter how unhinged they appear to be. But are you betraying yourselfyou donrsquot do what you think to be best at the time, for career and perhaps your familyrsquos future  Yes, you will argue this suggests principles. But what are they  Groucho Marx once declared ldquoThose are my principles, andyou donrsquot like them... well, I have others. He was joking, of course, but his words sit perfectly with the modern climate.Which means itrsquos hard to argue the moral principle as regarding Brendan Rodgers. He operates in a free market economy which employs transients. Itrsquos not fair to say this is the worst act of disloyalty since Judas took up cheek kissing.Yet, itrsquos not wrong to see why Hoopsrsquo fansrsquo green blood is boiling. A football club isnrsquot called a club for no reason.The th-century philosopher Josiah Royce spoke of the relation between the conscious inidual and the universal thought ndash ldquowhich will be decided in the sense of their own inclusion, as elements in the universal thought.

Indeed, the SNP will shortly seek to implement a presumption against sentences of less than  months and thus it does accept that politicians have a role in how sentencing, and therefore appeals, operate.ldquoThere is a role for politicians in ensuring our justice system meets the needs of victims and society, and it is crucial that victims understand and have faith in our system.ldquoWe would be failing, surely, in our dutywhen a perpetrator has walked free, having been found guilty of sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl, we do not empower the Scottish Law Commission to review whether the undue leniency test is overly restrictive.Labour justice spokesman Daniel Johnson said that the ldquojustice system still has a distance to travel in both consistency and transparency.The party has called forsentencing guidelines for sexual assault to be changed, particularly for young people.Mr Johnson said: ldquoHow can it be fair or just to sentence someone on the basis of the le chances they have had to date.ldquoIt can not be right that two iniduals receive dferent sentences for the same crime because of whether or not they were lucky in the lottery of le.ldquoThe reality is we have been discussing the need for sentencing guidelines for more than  years.ldquoIn the three-and-a-half years since it was created, the Scottish Sentencing Council has only produced one guideline.ldquoOf course guidance on sentencing must not be rushed and must be subject to careful consideration and reflection, but I think it is right we ask questions as to whether this progress has been adequate.Justice Secretary Humza Yousafstressed that the Scottish Sentencing Councilhad a wider roll than just producing guidelines, adding it was also responsible for matters such as promoting greater awareness and understanding of sentencing policy.He said: ldquoOne of the reasons why guidelines can take a bit of time to come to fruition is because public consultation is a key part of that.ldquoAt the first meeting of the Sentencing Council it was determined that every single guideline they produce will then go to public consultation, so there is a consultation for guidelines as there would be for legislation.The Justice Secretary alsospoke about the need for guidelines to be ldquoright and not rushed."},{"url":null,"title":"independent-scotlands-entry-into-the-eu-would-be-easy-says-mep-elmar-brok","story":"Known as the Father of the House, Elmar Broke has been an MEP since  and is credited with writing the constitution of the EU by many.:Herald poll: Scotland should have independence referendum after BrexitSpeaking to former first ministerAlex Salmondon his RT programme, the MEP, who went to Edinburgh University,saidthatBrexitwill lead to Scotland thinking again about independence.He said: ldquoThis is one of the nations closest to my heart ... this country is so wonderful, this is so pro-European ... and therefore I wish Scotland all the luck for the future and I know that the membership in the European Union is of the utmost importance for the future economic and social development of Scotland.Asked about the EUrsquos attitude to a future Scottish application for membership, Brok said: ldquoIf that is done in a referendum under the rules of the United Kingdom, andyou decide so then it would be then easy to have membership negotiations because Scotland fulfils all the needs for membership, because all the standards are already there, and therefore I am not pushing for iding the United Kingdom, hopefully the United Kingdom could together be a member together of the European Union butthe United Kingdom goes out of the European Union I can imagine that the Scottish people will think a second time.Brok told Salmondrsquos latest show that he still ldquodreams that Britain will stay in but sees this as unrealistic and the worst fear is a ldquohard Brexit by default.He expressed his ldquogreat regret about Brexit saying that he ldquonever believed that the United Kingdom would have no interest in its own interests.:Theresa May insists SNP Government is betraying Scotland with higher taxesHe also used the  to describe Brexit negotiationsas ldquostupid and warned that a hard Brexit is now a very real danger.ldquoI think there is a very good chance of the hard Brexit,\" he said.ldquoFor sure itrsquos a lose-lose situation for both of us and for economic reasons, as trading power but also for security policy we would like to have Britain in, but Britain is in this marketplace  times smaller than the market of the European Union so you know who will be the stronger part.A member of the German Christian Democratic Unionparty, Brok sits in the European Parliamentrsquos European Peoplersquos Party bloc.

They donrsquot have the same framework of rights as adults. They have protections, and essentially when we talk about childrenrsquos rights, what we are really talking about is the right of professionals to make decisions on their behalf.ldquoSo itrsquos a confused concept. It goes against the framework of how we have historically thought about rights in terms of freedoms.\"He added: ldquoYou are undermining the autonomy of loving parents to decide how to raise their children with a sense of privacy and also a sense of support from society.ldquoAnd in the process you are degrading something which is done as a form of discipline that should not be understood as a form of violence.He insisted children and adults should be treated dferently, adding: ldquoWe would not expect to ground our partners ndash refuse to let them leave the house.ldquoThat would be seen as a criminal offence, whereas we ground our children ndash or perhaps in a few yearsrsquo time, you will be making that criminal as well.He later continued: ldquoI would like to ask how you can dferentiate the upset a child feels at being grounded for a week, for example, compared to having their bottom or hand smacked.ldquoBecause I cannot see how, in the future,yoursquore going to be logically consistent, you will not eventually say that that should be banned as well.ldquoBecause the lsquolevel of vulnerabilityrsquo that you understand children to have is so high, and their lack of resilience is so profound, that I canrsquot see how this canrsquot eventually in five, ten yearsrsquo time, end up problematising almost any form of discipline whatsoever.Earlier, Dr Waiton told MSPs the Bill was ldquotragic and depressing and ldquoyet another one which appears to represent the aloof, elitist nature of politics and professional le, that treats parents in a very patronising and degraded way, uses all sorts of weird, legalistic talk about violence, equating children with adults, that makes no sense at all to ordinary people, and criminalises parents despite, again, people trying to claim that it doesnrsquot.He added: ldquoPeople talk about all the evidence proves that any level of smacking children damages them. Thatrsquos absolutely untrue and the opposite of the truth.ldquoBut I presume Irsquom just wasting my time because this Bill is already passed.The academic, who was the only one of eight witnesses to speak out against the legislation, argued banning smacking risked serious abuse cases getting lost in a ldquosea of complaints.But Diego Quiroz, policy officer at the Scottish Human Rights Commission, said it was ldquoshocking to argue children donrsquot have rights, and compared it to treating them like property ldquoor as wives were treated a century ago, or slaves even.Dr Waiton said this characterisation of his argument was ldquoquite despicable.Meanwhile, Professor Jane Callaghan, director of child wellbeing and protection at the University of Stirling, argued smacking does not have a place in a civilised culture.Public health researcher Dr Anja Heilmann said  countries around the world have now banned physical punishment.She said the UK was one of only three countries in the EU not to have outlawed the practice, while there is no evidence prosecutions have increased as a result of new laws where."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7808758.jpg?type=article-full","title":"match-made-in-heaven-helping-you-plan-your-dream-wedding","story":"Moda DeaThe award-winning fashion boutique specialises in Mother of the Bride and Groom, cocktail and casual wear in sizes eight-, and accessories including hats fascinators to match every outfit.Their award-winning Rainbow shoes are also available and can be dyed to any colour.

The Met Office predicted recently that  is likely to be one of the warmest on record and that would mean  of the hottest-ever years have been since .Fact two: Planting trees and making timber products is one of the cheapest, simplest methods of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon.These two facts are not unrelated.Thankfully, the Committee on Climate Change , official adviser to the UK and devolved governments, has made the link. It says tackling climate change is no longer about limiting emissions we must remove carbon from the atmosphere to meet our targets ndash and forestry and wood is one \"simple, low-cost option\" to make real progress.Environmental organisations are getting the message too. Friends of the Earth has called for a doubling of UK tree coverto make a real impact - and as the body representing forestry and wood-using businesses across the UK, Confor has made forests, wood and climate change its priority for .When people hear the phrase Carbon Capture and Storage, I want them to think tree planting and using wood. Other optionsare often unproven and costly. Tree planting is simple, proven and cost-effective the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation calculated it was less than US per tonne of CO.A report for Confor looking at forestry in southern Scotland estimated that a hectare of woodland delivered carbon benefits of . tonnes of CO every year, slightly more than a personrsquos average annual emissions of . tonnes.Locking up carbon in wood products is not just good in itself - it also replaces far more energy-intensive materials. The Forestry Commission estimated that between . and . tonnes of carbon dioxide are saved because of the lower energy consumption involved in the manufacture of wood products, compared with materials like concrete or brick.Wood also gives us warm homes. In terms of thermal insulation, it is  times better than concrete,  times better than steel and  times better than aluminium.A hectare of woodland can offset more than the CO of an inidual for one year.Growing more of our own wood is also imperative around  per cent of UK wood products are imported, making us the second highest net importer in the world after China! We must take more responsibility for our supply chains, growing trees here under the worldrsquos highest sustainability standards, not exporting our environmental footprint to fragile global forests.Planting modern forests also gives us more than carbon-sequestering trees that will produce renewable supplies of carbon-storing timber. We also create green jobs , enhance bioersity, help reduce flood risks and increase recreation and tourism opportunities.We demonstrated these multiple benefits to Scottish Government Minister Mairi Gougeon when she visited the Jerah planting site in central Scotland last week - especially the way trees planted on the hill can reduce flooding in the community below. A study is being carried out by Heriot Watt University to learn lessons for future large-scale planting sites.Im encouraged by the progress Scotland is making on new woodland creation. Confor worked hard to streamline bureaucracy and create a positive message about modern, multi-purpose and mixed-species forestry - and Fergus Ewing, Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy, is a passionate supporter of modern forestry and the economic, environmental and social benefits, which can go hand in hand.A positive partnership between the Scottish Government, forestry and wood processing sector and wider rural interests has created a much better climate for productive tree planting. Last year, Scotland planted around  per cent of all new UK forests and has much more ambitioustargets for woodland creation than the rest of the UK.Scotlands Forestry Strategy, published earlier this month, re-affirms that positive approach to delivering multiple benefits by planting more forests. Encouragingly, it calls for tree planting and woodland creation and maintenance to become a \"shared national endeavour\".This approach fits perfectly with Scotlands desire to lead the way on climate change - setting a high bar for reducing emissions and leaping over it. If tackling climate change has been a golden thread of policy over the last decade and more, then forestry is the green gold in that thread - an environmentally and economically friendly industry which can help Scotland deliver on its climate change ambitions.Yet our climate change ambitions and responsibilities are not, and can not, be limited to our shores. Our approach has to be international. To make a real dference on climate change, lets think global - and plant local.Stuart Goodall is Chief Executive of Confor, and The Heralds Climate for Change guest editor.

However, what our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage and we are about to find out whether Parliament has it.Mr Eustace said, as a minister, he had enjoyed good relations with the European Commission and with ministers from other member states.But he then noted: ldquoI do not believe that the Commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and dficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave.ldquoIf the position of Parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement, then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door, insisted the former minister.Read more:We must support Government through Brexit, insists Micheal MartinHe went on: ldquoWe must therefore have the courage,necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of lsquono-deal the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window.Mr Eustace added: ldquoI will do what I can from the back benches to try to salvage this sorry situation and I hope that, when the moment comes, Parliament will not let our country down.In response, Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, tweeted: \"Another day another resignation from the UK Government.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupThursday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I.

I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks.

It’s harder to do things by halves, in a way... You’re not fully invested, so you get bogged down by the self-doubt and not knowing why you’re doing it and what choices you’re making.”He continues: “I wanted to have an authentic experience, but that meant shooting in Malawi was going to be really important.

It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PORTREE-BRAES-TRUST-FIONA-AND-SOPHIE-2.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now. Those responsible would be handed their Ps."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland olympic hero dame mary peters further honoured by the queen","story":"Dame Mary, from Northern

Braid Valley Vintage Enthusiasts presented the Scheme with a cheque for pound, for the purchase of two defibrillators and response packs.John Crothers presented the cheque to Stephen Lamont and Alan Murray, two of the team working to get the scheme operational by early summer. Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles. A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lagmore bus service has been partially reinstated","story":"A vital bus service that was pulled from the Colin area last Tuesday night – due to a spate of anti-social behaviour and attacks on Translink drivers – was reinstated last night.The Andersonstown News reported last week how Sinn Féin Councillor Danny Baker was “fighting” to save the much needed d feeder service to Mount Eagles after it was taken off around pm last Tuesday night after five youths smashed a rear window of a bus inspector’s car and tried to pull at the doors of passing buses. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again. The impact since the service was pulled has been huge. “It’s a one-mile walk from the bottom of Lagmore never mind the safety aspect at night. It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"trade unionist movement launch in belfast","story":"A NEW trade union movement say unionist workers must be heard in the debate on ending Irish partition.Trade Unionists for a New and United Irelandcomprises more than  trade union officials, including a number of general secretaries.Having unveiled the movement in Dublin on Monday, the group held their launch in the north on Tuesday morning at Belfast’s Linen Hall Library.TUNUI want to advocate for reunication and convince the trade unions in Ireland to adopt a pro-unity stance.Spokesman Ruairi Creaney, from the Communication Workers Union, said that a conference being organised by TUNUI in Dublin in April would devote part of the programme to addressing unionist concerns.“I don’t think the unionist working class are as afraid of this issue as the media and others make it out to be,” he said.“It is patronising and dismissive of our unionist brothers and sisters.

Its thought around  people could be involved including some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles.A £ million package to deal with legacy issues was agreed at Stormont House talks in  but not released until a way to deal with the past was agreed.In  the Lord Chief Justice announced a radical plan to deal with the backlog saying all cases could be dealt with within five years providing the funding was made available. A new Legacy Inquest Unit will be set up within the Coroners Service to process legacy inquests, under the remit of the Lord Chief Justice. This will be supported by additional officials from the PSNI, Public Prosecution Service and other justice agencies.It has been given a six-year timescale to reflect the need to build up capacity and the complexity of the outstanding legacy inquest cases.Peter May, permanent secretary of the Department of Justice, said: “The delays in progressing legacy inquests have been unacceptable to families involved and to the justice system. “In the Hughes Judicial Review judgment, the Court ruled that progress on securing funding for legacy inquests should not be linked with agreement on the overall legacy package but taken forward as a separate issue.“This initiative takes account of that judgment and will support a signicant expansion of capacity to clear the outstanding legacy inquests over the next six years.”Welcoming the support his department had received in progressing the reform programme, Mr May added: “I am grateful to both the Lord Chief Justice for developing his proposals to reform legacy inquest process and to the Department of Finance for agreeing to the business case to bring this programme into operation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"rhi proposals are crushing blow for farmers says ufu","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Questions have now been raised over whether this will affect schemes in other EU countries.Mr Trimble said: \"That means every other European renewable energy scheme is unlawful.

The method used to calculate payments is unfair, reliant on employers reporting wages on time and can lead to massive rental debts.“Universal Credit replaced a host of benefits including Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit, and some families on the new benefit are beginning to witness its pitfalls. Working Tax Credit payments were based on expected earnings for the year, whereas Universal Credit payments are based on earnings reported to HMRC in the previous month.“Working in Colum Eastwood’s constituency office in Northside, we are contacted on a weekly basis by people receiving no Universal Credit payments due to inaccurate or late reporting of their wages to HMRC.“If wages are reported late then Universal Credit payments can be affected. It all comes down to the Assessment Period, the month long period preceding payment which is used to calculate entitlement to Universal Credit.“We’ve had countless incidents where employers have reported wages late which resulted in two monthly wages going into one Assessment Period, giving the impression of massive monthly earnings. This has led to no Universal Credit payment the following month.“The flip side is that there will then be a preceding Assessment Period with no wages reported which leads to an inflated Universal Credit payment. It all financially balances out over the two-month period but it makes it very dficult for families to budget.“But the critical and most worrying aspect is the impact on Housing Costs. Most people on Universal Credit get help with Housing Costs which goes directly to the landlord, the equivalent of the old Housing Benefit system.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“In a month where no wages are reported they get an inflated Universal Credit payment with Housing Costs paid directly to the landlord. In a month where two wages are reported, they get no Universal Credit payment and the landlord receives no rent.“The Universal Credit payments balance out over two months but the landlord only receives one months rent, leaving the claimant in rent arrears.“One real le example is where a young Derry mother’s employer reported wages ten days late and she now owes her landlord nearly £ in rent. Had the wages been reported on time, she would owe her landlord nothing.“The sad reality is thatyour employer reports your wages late to HMRC that it could cost you a months rent.“We’ve asked Universal Credit to recalculate monthly payments and Housing Costs based on the dates employees were actually paid, but theyve said the system doesnt allow for this.“The system must change. Entitlement to Universal Credit must be calculated on actual monthly income, not calculated on when it was reported to HMRC.”“The SDLP voted against all aspects of Welfare Reform. Universal Credit is wreaking havoc on our society and it should be scrapped. In the absence of that, the British Government must take decisive action to make it fairer system for all.”CAPTION: SDLP candidate Rory Farrell."},{"url":null,"title":"powys budget argument in

It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child.

Longford settled first and leading marksman Darren Gallagher registered the first score with a free in the fourth minute, but despite a lot of possession, the home side struggled to get scores on the board.Downrsquos defensive cover was superb with Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty making a more than impressive debut at half back.He received great support from Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Castlewellanrsquos Colm Flanagan and Bryansfordrsquos Ruairi Wells as Down closed up shop.Mind you, Down also struggled early on to get scores, but all that changed in the th minute.A measured long ball in from Caolan Mooney was ruthlessly pounced upon by OrsquoHare and he finished to the net with panache.Points from Gallagherand Liam Connerton drew Longford level in the th minute, but Down responded in style and regained the initiative with unanswered points from OrsquoHare , Conor Poland and corner back Gerard Collins.Longford had a goal chance in the th minute when Darren Quinn carved out an opening for the lurking Gallagher, but Burns made am outstanding save to deny the danger man and send Down in at the break with a - to - lead.Paddy Tallyrsquos men stretched their lead to seven within one minute of the second half when another long ball in, this time from Poland, picked out OrsquoHare and he grabbed his and his sidersquos second goal.Longford got a much needed point from Connor Berry in the th minute, but minutes later Burns denied Gallagher. Longford were made to rue those missed goal chances in the th minute when Jerome Johnston found Daniel Guinness and he played it to OrsquoHare who got his third goal.Berry kicked over a free in the th minute and two minutes later Longford had a chance for a goal when they were awarded a penalty after Quinn was fouled. Up stepped Gallagher, but his spot-kick was pushed out for a rsquo by the brilliant Burns. Gallagher made no mistake with the rsquo, but Longford really needed a goal at this stage.Jerome Johnstonand Daniel Guinness added points to their score while Longford got consolation points from Gallagher and Connerton.Down are now level on points with Louth, but behind on score dference.

Taking part in the mass were Canon Sean Rogan, who is a former school governor, family friend Fr Seamus McGinley and Diocesan priest Canon Noel Conway.Among those attending were Mr Eamonn McGrady, chairman of the schoolrsquos board of governors, and Mrs Darlingrsquos husband, Martin.Mrs Darling is leaving the school in the equally capable hands of the incoming principal, Miss Rosemary McLoughlin, who is the current vice-principal.Having worked at St Maryrsquos since , Miss McLoughlin is the perfect person to steward the school over the next few years as St Maryrsquos faces the prospect of joining the new lsquosuper schoolrsquo proposed by the CCMS for Downpatrick for .Itrsquos a challenge that Mrs Darling wishes she was around to oversee.ldquoRetiring is something thatrsquos really quite bittersweet for me because I will really miss the school and everyone here, and seeing the girls every morning, said Mrs Darling.ldquoBut of course I wonrsquot miss the administration. I actually thought of leaving last year but as we had our th anniversary I wasnrsquot going to leave before I had handled all of that.ldquoI think itrsquos nice for a principal to take over a school a little bit before the begining of an academic year.She sees the proposed new lsquosuper schoolrsquo as a great opportunity for the school and its students.ldquoI would have absolutely loved the challenge to ensure that every single child going into that school would be properly catered for and would be treated respectfully and fairly, she said.ldquoNot only our girls but that the children from the other schools would be treated equally and fairly.When Mrs Darling looks at her students, she unrelentingly sees promise and potential in each and every one and makes no apology for it.She is well-known for her high expectations for the students.ldquoI believe I have helped the children here to raise their aspirations, to hold their heads up high, be proud of who they are and realise that they are as good as anyone , that they are capable of being successful in their own right and to bring that success to their families and their communities, said Mrs Darling.ldquoOur children in this school have seen GCSE and A-Level results increase year on year. They know that I expect them to achieve. I expect them to work hard and to keep going until they get it right and until they get to where they want to be.ldquoTheir parents have been a wonderful support to me as a principal. They have been very engaged and we have travelled the same path together. We have built a very constructive partnership to support their children to be the very best they can be.ldquoItrsquos very important to me that every child coming through the door of this school know that they are valued, they are cherished and that they are provided with a first-class education, to progress and to be the best that they can be.Mrs Darling speaks highly of her teaching staff and all the staff who help make St Maryrsquos the school it is today.ldquoI was very warmly welcomed into the Downpatrick area and the parents were extremely supportive. We have a wonderful board of governors who have been very supportive in working with me and the vision I had for the school and Irsquom very fortunate to have had the staff that I had, she added.Like many other teachers, she was called into education due to being inspired by her own teachers from Newtownhamilton in Co Armagh where she was raised.ldquoI always wanted to be a teacher, recalled Mrs Darling. ldquoI think I was fortunate to have wonderful teachers as a pupil and was really inspired by many of them.

But then I have really enjoyed the drive through the Mournes in the sunlight. It can be absolutely glorious. The sunrises are amazing, as are the sunsets, and I have seen both of them on working days.Retirement will give her and her husband a chance to travel and spend more time with their daughter and son who live in Boston and London respectively, and to increase her leisure activities.ldquoI donrsquot intend to sit on a chair, she said. ldquoI will be working with a number of charities to support them and I certainly hope I will be in a position to make a dference in some of the charities.ldquoI hope to work with Sister Consilio [who runs an addiction treatment centre] with her work in Downpatrick.ldquoFrom my perspective, it enables me to carry on the Mercy tradition which is so tangible in this school plus I have worked in this community for eight and a half years and I want to give back.Her parting words to the school and colleagues were: ldquoI have always wanted every child in this school to feel they really do matter, that they will be cared for here and their lives will be enriched by the experiences they have here..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Programme of events to mark St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"THE countdown is on to this yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations in Downpatrick.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has lined up a wide range of events, concerts and activities, culminating in the annual cross community parade which will take place on Sunday, March  mdash despite the fact that the major religious events in honour of the patron saint have been switched to the following day.Earlier this month, the Recorder revealed that a number of traders in Downpatrick were angry that the decision to hold the carnival parade on the Sunday was taken without consulting them.With March  falling on the Sabbath, the annual St Patrickrsquos pilgrimage walk from Saul Church into the centre of the town and the traditional cross-community ecumenical service at Down Cathedral will both take place on the following day.The flagship Downpatrick carnival parade has been held before on a Sunday when the former Down Council was the organiser but previously when St Patricks Day fell on a Sunday, the cross-community spectacular has been moved to the day after.The decision to hold the Downpatrick parade on March  means the town will now host two major events on the same day, with the hugely popular Jimmys K road race taking place in the morning ahead of the festival parade starting at pm.Three weeks ago traders said Downpatrick is always busy in the lead-up to the parade with the majority of themdoing relatively well on what is the townrsquos busiest day of the year in attracting visitors.Some in the business community argue that traders will ldquolose out as the parade is taking place on Sunday as the majority will not have the opportunity to enjoy the same income they would expectthe event was held on a Saturday or Monday.Several traders said they were not surprised that council officials did not consult them before making a decision to hold the cross-community parade on the Sunday.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Rev Hutton recounted how two gunmen took his sisters hostage until he ed late one evening, and shot him in front of them.Prof Patterson talked about his book, about the dficulties the British authorities had faced in receiving Irish co-operation to try to stop terrorists using the Republic as a base, and about the one-sided nature of the legacy narrative.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
