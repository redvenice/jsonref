In my life when I’ve flown, only once in the last 40 years have I not been called over by customs to search my bags.”She revealed she had made a note of all the headlines comparing Kate Middleton to Meghan Markle and was frustrated and saddened at denials that race has played a part in the media’s differential treatment of the Duchess of Sussex.Asked her thoughts on racial fluidity and whether somebody could just “feel black”, she said: “It’s a tricky one. I believe in gender fluidity and that you can be born in the wrong body. With race, you can admire someone’s culture, but if you’re not born into it …“Can I, for example, just turn around and say I am an Inuit because that’s how I want to identify? There’s more to it than that, it’s about being brought up in the culture. It’s an interesting thing to explore, maybe I’ll try and write a story about it!”Blackman’s autobiography is due to be published by #Merky Books, founded by Stormzy, who has a cameo in the series. In one episode he plays a newspaper editor, a role created especially for him.She felt positive that sensibilities like colour-blind casting in TV and film were beginning to catch up with the times. “That’s why I loved the recent BBC adaptation of A Christmas Carol when Mary Cratchit was played by Vinette Robinson.“Some people complained that a woman of colour was playing her – they had no problems when Miss Piggy played the part though, did they?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f71b3afba1aaf9ae3da8499ced063494379313ce/0_100_5644_3386/master/5644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86c4c881860a861ec9829ca9485537f","title":"stock market sell off coronavirus companies croda dow ftse business live","story":"European markets are in the red again after Dow plunged by 1,000 points last nightEuropean stocks are under pressure again, because Italian authorities have just announced the first positive coronavirus case in the South of Italy.A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, has tested positive for Covid-19. The patient, who is not in serious conditions, has been transferred to the Hospital Cervello in Palermo, our Coronavirus liveblog reports....Three more people have died from the virus in Iran (taking the total to 15), and there are almost 1,000 cases in South Korea. Josh Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, explains:What was largely a Chinese issue to resolve has soon become an international problem, with European eyes transfixed on Italian efforts to curb the spread of the virus. With European borders open and the Italian ‘patient zero’ still unknown, things could easily turn from bad to worse in the efforts to keep the coronavirus at bay.With tourism to and from China plummeting, there is little reason to expect any different in Europe if this virus spreads throughout the continent. The declines seen for largely European-focused airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair highlight the increasing fear that we will see travel locked down closer to home, with obvious knock-on implications for consumer activity should that occurBritain’s FTSE 100 has dropped back to yesterday’s two-month closing low of 7163 points, and the Stoxx 600 index is slightly negative.Another specialist UK manufacturer, Morgan Advanced Materials, also expects to lose millions of pounds due to Covid-19.Morgan makes heat-resistant products such as thermal ceramics, crucibles and high-tech seals for use in extreme temperatures and corrosive environments.

This will dent Morgan’s output - and thus revenues and profits -- as Reuters explains:Industrial materials maker Morgan Advanced Materials has closed its manufacturing facilities in China because of the coronavirus outbreak and expects a hit to 2020 revenue and headline operating profit as a result, the company said on Tuesday.Morgan made operating profits of £134m last year, so this is a small but noticeable hit.UK engineering and consulting firm Ricardo has issued a profit warning, due to the coronavirus.Ricardo, which focuses on the transport, energy and scarce resources sectors, has told investors that full-year earnings will suffer a ‘material’ hit because of the Coronavirus’ disruptive impact on its China auto and rail operations.Ricardo, which has nine offices and technical centres in China, says business development, project delivery and client engagement have all suffered from the crisis.

That’s its third biggest points decline ever, as technology companies, energy providers and mining firms bore the brunt.The corporate cost of the crisis is mounting too. Overnight, Mastercard cut its financial outlook due to the outbreak and United Airlines withdrew its full-year 2020 guidance.Fears of a pandemic, with massive implications on global supply chains and world economic growth, are rife.But after very heavy losses across the board yesterday, we may see a small recovery in European stock markets today. Britain’s FTSE 100 has just opened 30 points higher, at 7,186.That’s only a teensy recovery, mind, as it plunged by 247 points during Monday’s rout.Investors are glued to the latest reports of infection levels, with the global death toll now over 2,600.So there’s little chance of the markets calming down soon, argues Michael Hewson of CMC Markets.There is no question financial markets are coming round to the realisation that this particular crisis is likely to have a slightly longer shelf life than many thought was the case a couple of weeks ago, however flu outbreaks are hardly anything new. They happen every year and according to the World Health Organisation flu kills up to 650,000 a year, yet markets are reacting to an outbreak that has so far only affected a fraction of that number.That is not to downplay the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, given how little we know about it, but it could be argued that the reaction of governments to the outbreak in closing borders and restricting movement is actually making things worse, as well as sowing confusion and fear amongst their populations.For now, there appears little prospect that financial markets look likely to settle down in the short term, which means investors will have to get used to an extended period of uncertainty and volatility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b597c689e7aaaff7a08e18175c72ca5b9815a64e/0_142_4979_2988/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d802bc122929cd986a4b893633a44a","title":"labour lib dems pact","story":"Tony Blair has called for a new progressive alliance. A merger is for the birds, but the party should listen to himThe Labour leadership vote is at last under way. Let no future contest hold such a purgatory of hustings, forcing candidates to say something new every day: Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey fell into the trans thorn bushes, while Keir Starmer may have overpromised.But how would they feel about the huge compromise that has just loomed over the horizon, proposed by two people some Labour members may be disinclined to hear – Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey? In Blair’s sweeping – and brutal – tour of Labour’s history at a speech marking the party’s 120th anniversary, he warned of a “make-or-break” crisis. “The Labour party is not an NGO, and not a pressure group. Its aim is not to trend on Twitter, or to have celebrities (temporarily) fawn over it … Our task is to win power.”Listing electoral failures, he blamed a historical structural fault: that first split with the Liberals. “We must correct the defect from birth, which separated the Liberal reforming traditions of Lloyd George, Beveridge and Keynes from the Labour ones of Keir Hardie, Attlee, Bevin and Bevan.” He called for a “whole new progressive alliance” to bring back these artificially separated strands.Frankly, the notion of a merger is for the birds. Although many Labour members advocated tactical voting for Lib Dems in unwinnable seats, that’s a million miles from permanent union – Lib Dems stay unforgiven for coalition austerity. Nor would their members take kindly to mixing their DNA with a Corbynised party. But Davey gingerly put a toe in that water. Picking up Blair’s challenge in the Sunday Times, he wrote: “Facing this rightwing Conservative administration, progressive politicians must at least explore how we might work better together, even tentatively.”Mid-election, Labour candidates may shy away from such treason. But the Liberals have always lain like a water buffalo across Labour’s tracks, as Roy Jenkins once put it. First-past-the-post allows no third party, except as a wrecker, and it has split the non-Tory vote time and again. But the last thing our decaying democracy needs is less choice. What’s needed is a one-time-only pact to not stand against each other in any seat, with a manifesto promise to bring in proportional representation as a first act, needing no referendum.Looking across the Atlantic we see the worst of first-past-the-post two-party constriction, forcing into one bed Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg, making traditional Republicans cohabit with Donald Trump. Under a civilised voting system, the Tories would have split between pro- and anti-Europeans – and there would be no Brexit.There should be a socialist and a social democratic party. Trying to contain both has led to historical Labour strife. Talking to Labour members on a phonebank this weekend, I heard many threaten to walk if Long-Bailey wins, while some said they’d quit if Starmer showed any sign of turning “Blairite”.Four years is a long stretch to the next election, with Brexit and Johnson fallout as yet unfathomable. Labour members are weighing up which qualities will matter most by then: endurance, a rhinoceros hide against all attacks, solid principles and strategic cunning. Some demand charisma, but that may be a fading asset after years of Johnson japes. In my view, a Labour party led by a serious heavyweight former prosecutor, backed by a strong new shadow team, would be a formidable opposition to Johnson chaos and his low-calibre cabinet. To beat a majority of 80 in one election is an Everest to climb. By that time, Labour and the Lib Dems may be ready to make a deal to block another Tory victory.The next few years will be a gruelling uphill slog, watching the Tories do things while Labour can only say things from the sidelines. The party should listen to Blair and Davey: a temporary pact may be the best chance of preventing another slaughter at the polls. A new leader can open new doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e779dcbb9e497a28edf461d6ba31020e549263/0_23_4401_2641/master/4401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92705e5704436b2550e204ece4c0c472","title":"why does anyone want to live to 100","story":"Ask me when I’m 99, but I really don’t understand the desire to go on and on. What is important is a good social life – whatever your age“Hope I die before I get old,” is clearly an old-fashioned sentiment. As I read about the possibilities of longevity, I also see the mounting care crisis among elderly people. On one hand, we are told of the sprightly inhabitants of Okinawa, the Greek island of Ikaria and Sardinia on the other, we have falling life expectancy, especially for women in the most deprived parts of England. As ever, a social issue gets funnelled into inidual advice about fasting, exercise and keeping your brain active. Follow the familiar instructions and you can live to 100.But why does anyone want to? Maybe ask me that when I am 99, but, for now, I really don’t get this idea of going on and on. I can’t for the life of me understand what on earth possesses Bernie Sanders to keep going. This is not a political point, but does he really want to be running the world in his 80s?If I mention mortality – my own in particular – people tell me to stop being morbid when I am merely being realistic. My youngest is upset that I do not want to be frozen and woken up in the future. It is a sign of my utter selfishness that I do not believe in or have the money to invest in cryonics. Stick me in an old chest freezer if it helps.Some of us will be active and healthy way past their threescore years and 10, and some in chronic pain or with dementia. Ageing well, though, is down not just to lifestyle but also to the kind of society in which we live.It is really noticeable in Japan, for instance, that old people work in the market and are part of the hustle and bustle, just as in Greece, where elderly people are eating in the taverns. In the UK, elderly people are segregated and lonely. You can eat all the wholegrains you want, but a good old age is one in which other people feature.

After eight years a tribunal could force changes to selectionWhen James Coombs’ eldest son turned 10, it seemed natural to put him in for the 11-plus test. He was a bright lad, often at the top of the class in his Buckinghamshire primary school, and the grammar school was just down the road.So it came as a bit of a surprise when the boy didn’t pass.“We got the results by post,” Coombs says. “Three inidual scores for maths, verbal reasoning and non-verbal reasoning, all given very precisely to two decimal places. His overall score was less than the cut-off mark. My first thought was: How could a couple of hours of multiple choice questions come up with such precise measures?”Coombs, who works in IT and has a background in data science, is not a man to give up without a fight. So he queried the result with the school. “Like a teacher, I said: ‘Show me your workings.’ I thought the school had made a mistake, and that could have affected a number of people.” He could have had no idea that his tentative inquiry would lead him, eight years down the line, to a hearing on 4 March at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in London. The outcome could have far-reaching implications for those interested in how, and indeed whether, selection works.If the tribunal agrees to release raw data on children’s 11-plus test scores, it could open the door to a flood of similar requests from parents – and others. Academics who want to pin down whether grammar school pupils do better than they would have done elsewhere could ask for fresh data. And the outcome just might shed light on the fraught issue of whether a test can be “tutor proof”.Coombs’ son – who prefers to stay out of the fray and remain nameless – went off happily to the local comprehensive in 2013. He continued to thrive, and in 2018 gained excellent grades at GCSE, before entering the sixth form at his local grammar school. He has recently received a university offer to read material science at Oxford.His father, meanwhile, has continued his pursuit for information. At issue is his request under the Freedom of Information Act for data on the raw scores awarded to children sitting the 11-plus test his son sat.The test was set by the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring (CEM) – one of two bodies that run most of the tests for England’s 163 grammar schools. The score seen by parents is a different, standardised one, adjusted to take into account external factors. These might, for instance, include the fact that children born in August are at an age disadvantage to their September-born peers.Coombs argues there has been a pervasive lack of transparency surrounding 11-plus testing, and that this should be challenged. In particular, he wants to know whether an increase in applications from pupils who live outside Buckinghamshire is making it more difficult for local children to get in: the standardised scores he has been given don’t show this, as they are adjusted so that the pass mark is always the same.It has been a long journey. In 2014, he submitted a detailed request for raw data to the CEM. The centre refused, citing a freedom of information exemption allowing bodies to withhold information on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.Durham University, then owner of the CEM – since sold to the University of Cambridge – argued that to publish raw test scores would undermine its unique selling point: that its tests judged pupils’ natural ability, allowing schools to find the brightest pupils, rather than those whose parents could afford to pay for a coach. A key argument against selection has been that it disadvantages poorer families.Publication of the raw scores would enable both competitors and tutors to understand the CEM’s methods, the university said, which would undermine its efforts to reduce the effects of coaching.The centre says it has never used the phrase “tutor proof”, and its then director said in 2016 he did not support a claim that the test could detect “natural ability”. But it does say on its website that its tests are designed “to demonstrate their academic potential and ability without the need for coaching and excessive preparation”.Its site also bears a quote from a grammar school headteacher who says: “I wanted a test that delivered the brightest boys regardless of whether they could afford to be tutored – and that’s clearly what we’ve got.” reported in 2014 that, following the introduction of the CEM’s test in Buckinghamshire, the gap between state and private school pupils accepted into its grammar schools had actually widened. Buckinghamshire has since dropped the CEM test and returned to one of the centre’s competitors.The years since Coombs’ son was refused a grammar place have been taken up with internal reviews, submissions to the information commissioner, and tribunal decisions. Although a hearing found against Coombs, an appeal ruled that the case should be re-examined.The argument now centres on whether the CEM’s commercial interests are outweighed by the public interest in knowing how the tests work. But the wider argument Coombs makes is that without transparency the administration of the tests – and their social or educational outcomes – cannot be properly scrutinised.“Basically,” he says, “the 11-plus is as opaque as hell. If you start trying to find out information that would be useful, possibly linking it to data on disadvantaged children, you get nowhere.”His campaign is being watched with interest. Prof Stephen Gorard, based at Durham University and a former colleague of the CEM team, has also requested raw test scores from the CEM and been refused.He believes the data could be used to answer a fundamental question: do grammar schools make any difference? Existing information suggests not, he says – in effect, their superior exam results are entirely explained by their intake. Gorard wants to use the data to identify children who passed the 11-plus but who didn’t go to grammar school. He could then compare their GCSE results, he says, with those who got similar scores and who did go to a grammar. In order to get a big enough sample, he thinks he would need to have at least two years’ data.If the CEM released the data, he says, the Department for Education could use its national pupil database to link it anonymously to inidual pupils’ GCSE results and other records.“It’s in the public interest,” he says. “The majority of research shows grammars make no difference, and it’s extremely unlikely this would show anything different. But the approach we are suggesting is as powerful as doing a randomised trial, and that would be a decisive step forward.”Both Cambridge University, which now owns the CEM, and the University of Durham, which used to own it, have declined to comment while the tribunal case is pending.But whatever the outcome, Coombs has lots more questions, for other test providers as well as for CEM – and is determined to keep asking them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f5a4215765c202850b5da594b4b26071c8d5223/0_25_2203_1322/master/2203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9770ff42f80218ff64c1a1d3611e15fc","title":"teaching british values doesnt mean racism andrew sabisky","story":"The events of the past week or so give you a tremendous opportunity to storm into public view with a clear statement about British values in education and society, don’t you think?First, we’ve had the Andrew Sabisky affair. Here is a young man, not long out of full-time education, who has been happy to put into the public arena his ideas about race, intelligence, sex and arms expenditure. You must be acutely aware how the explosion of social media has raised the question of what role education should play in responding to the knowledge that school students can access outside school.The proposal that schools teach “British values” came in part, I think, from an anxiety that some young people were finding ideas online sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalism. We know that Sabisky hasn’t been shy in the past to put into the public space views that your colleague, Kwasi Kwarteng, described as “racist and reprehensible”.Perhaps you’ve been overly preoccupied with the floods, but might it not have been an opportunity for you, in your role as the figurehead of the English education system, to have made clear to young people and teachers that there is no room for eugenicist ideas in schools?I probably don’t need to remind you that the British, American and European past is haunted by the effects of such thought: it was used to justify colonisation, mass exploitation, sterilisation and genocide.Mind you, I can understand why you might have some difficulty being forthright about such matters. Your leader hasn’t been reluctant to flirt with racist ideas himself and his most favoured adviser, Dominic Cummings, who spent four years in your department, suggested in a 2014 blogpost that the NHS might pay for designer babies.Even so, if Mr Kwarteng could break ranks, then perhaps you could. I look forward to your update on the “British values” programme, making clear that schools are places of hope for all, and not the means of reinforcing spurious stratifications made at birth, or earlier. After all, you could explain that there are many people in this country, me included, who would not be alive today if the eugenicists of the 1930s had won the second world war.Then, straight off the back of Sabiskygate, came an announcement by the home secretary, Priti Patel, that migrants to this country will have to be able to speak English. Isn’t this matter on your patch, too? I’ve met thousands of children and parents who have learned their English here in schools, community centres, further education colleges and universities. Isn’t this a wonderful thing worth boasting about?Like Mr Kwarteng on Sabisky, you could make a stand. You could speak up for the fantastic work the education system does in teaching English to so many people who go on to benefit us all in countless different ways.You could also point out the absurdity of the UK government outsourcing education in English to countries of origin, explaining to Ms Patel that it is not really appropriate to demand that people sit in class for years, far away from the UK, in the hope that they might get enough points to be allowed to come and pick fruit or wheel a hospital bed, when we have such fantastic facilities, governed by your own department, for teaching English."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e7502a3d7ced244b2b74595932ffc440d080bc/122_273_2878_1727/master/2878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d727a1a82ce382325c1c2e69cf4196","title":"coronavirus closures reveal vast scale of chinas secretive wildlife farm industry","story":"Peacocks, porcupines and pangolins among species bred on 20,000 farms closed in wake of virusNearly 20,000 wildlife farmsraising species including peacocks, civet cats, porcupines, ostriches, wild geese and boar have been shut down across China in the wake of the coronavirus, in a move that has exposed the hitherto unknown size of the industry.Until a few weeks ago wildlife farming was still being promoted by government agencies as an easy way for rural Chinese people to get rich.But the Covid-19 outbreak, which has now led to over 1,800 deaths and more than 72,000 known infections, is thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan in early December, prompting a massive rethink by authorities on how to manage the trade.China issued a temporary ban on wildlife trade to curb the spread of the virus at the end of January and began a widespread crackdown on breeding facilities in early February.The country’s top legislative officials are now rushing to amend the country’s wildlife protection law and possibly restructure regulations on the use of wildlife for food and traditional Chinese medicine.The current version of the law is seen as problematic by wildlife conservation groups because it focuses on utilisation of wildlife rather than its protection.“The coronavirus epidemic is swiftly pushing China to reevaluate its relationship with wildlife,” Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the . “There is a high level of risk from this scale of breeding operations both to human health and to the impacts on populations of these animals in the wild.”Further instructions from the National People’s Congress are expected next week to give authorities more tools to enforce the ban and restrict trade until the law is amended.For the past few years China’s leadership has pushed the idea that “wildlife domestication” should be a key part of rural development, eco-tourism and poverty alleviation. A 2017 report by the Chinese Academy of Engineering on the development of the wildlife farming industry valued the wildlife-farming industry those operations at 520bn yuan, or £57bn.Just weeks before the outbreak, China’s State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) was still actively encouraging citizens to get into farming wildlife such as civet cats – a species pinpointed as a carrier of Sars, a disease similar to Covid-19. The SFGA regulates both farming and trade in terrestrial wildlife, and quotas of wildlife products – such as pangolin scales – allowed to be used by the Chinese medicine industry.On state TV the popular series Secrets of Getting Rich, which has aired since 2001, often touts these kinds of breeding operations – bamboo rats, snakes, toads, porcupines and squirrels have all had starring roles.But little was known about the scale of the wildlife farm industry before the coronavirus outbreak, with licensing mainly regulated by provincial and local-level forestry bureaus that do not ulge full information about the breeding operations under their watch. A report from state-run Xinhua news agency on 17 February revealed that from 2005–2013 the forestry administration only issued 3,725 breeding and operation licenses at the national level.But since the outbreak at least 19,000 farms have been shut down around the country, including about 4,600 in Jilin province, a major centre for traditional Chinese medicine. About 3,900 wildlife-farming operations were shuttered in Hunan province, 2,900 in Sichuan, 2,300 in Yunnan, 2,000 in Liaoning, and 1,000 in Shaanxi.There is little detail available about the animals farmed across China, but local press reports mention civet cats, bamboo rats, ostriches, wild boar, sika deer, foxes, ostriches, blue peacocks, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, wild geese, mallard ducks, red-billed geese, pigeons, and ring-necked pheasants.Neither do reports offer much detail about the shutdowns and what is happening to the animals, although Blake said he does not think animals are being culled, due to issues over compensation.Chen Hong, a peacock farmer in Liuyang, Hunan, said she is concerned about her losses and whether she will get compensation after her operations were suspended on 24 January.“We’re very worried about the farm’s future,” she added. “The shutdown has resulted in a loss of 400,000–500,000 yuan (£44,000–55,000) in sales, and if they decide to put an outright ban on raising peacocks, we’ll lose even more, at least a million yuan(£110,000).”On a visit to Shaoguan, Guangdong province, last year, the  and staff from CBCGDF saw a caged facility previously used for attempted breeding of the notoriously hard-to-breed pangolin.While there were no longer pangolin at the site, several locals near the facility confirmed the species had been raised there, along with monkeys and other wildlife.Besides being used for Chinese medicine, much of the meat from the wildlife trade is sold through online platforms or to “wet markets” like the one where the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have started in Wuhan.There have been calls for a deep regulatory overhaul to remove the conflicting duties of the forestry administration, and for a shift in government mindset away from promoting the utilisation of wildlife and towards its protection.Proposals include fully banning trade in wildlife that is protected or endangered within and outside of China, plus bans on raising and selling meat from known carriers of diseases that can impact humans such as civets, bats and rodents.There are concerns that in trying to prevent outbreaks authorities may go too far in the culling of wild animals that can carry disease.Additional research and reporting assistance provided by Jonathan Zhong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34cdee8fa17074978eef5f239c5a256bfad2c3c1/0_0_6272_3763/master/6272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3822c52841d1d138738972b80cc19e65","title":"farmers pile pressure on uk government over chlorinated chicken","story":"Calls for food standards to be enshrined in law to avoid post-Brexit ‘betrayal’ of consumersFarmers have hit back at suggestions the government will allow imports of chlorinated chicken and other low-standard farm produce in trade talks with the US, escalating the row over post-Brexit food standards.Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, will call for rules on minimum standards for imports to be enshrined in law, and insist that other countries must trade with the UK “on our terms”, rather than seek to water down food rules.“We must not tie the hands of British farmers to the highest rung of the standards ladder while waving through food imports which may not even reach the bottom rung,” Batters will tell the NFU’s annual conference on Tuesday.“If the government is serious about animal welfare and environmental protection, and doing more than any previous government, it must put legislation in the agriculture bill.”Farmers were told last month by Theresa Villiers, the former secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, that chlorinated chicken – which the US wants to be allowed to export to the UK, where it is currently banned on health grounds – would be excluded from any trade talks.Farmers fear they will face a flood of cheap imports undercutting high-standard British produce, and the potential for the EU to ban UK-produced food if standards were relaxed.But the government refused to enshrine Villiers’ promises into the agricultural bill going through parliament, and she was sacked in the reshuffle. At the weekend, the new environment secretary, George Eustice, refused to repeat her assurances, reigniting the row and infuriating farmers.Batters will present the dispute as an issue of public safety. “What is government waiting for?” she will ask. “What is more important to our economy, our health and our environment than the very food we eat?”She will call for ministers to “show global leadership, insist that UK farms standards are the benchmark for climate-friendly farming around the world, and that whoever wants to trade with us trades on our terms. We must not allow those standards to be undermined by imports of goods which would be illegal for our farmers to produce here.”Chlorinated chicken has grabbed the headlines but other practices pose a greater potential threat to human health. Within the EU, the use of antibiotics on farm animals falls under strict guidelines, which many other countries lack. Profligate use of antibiotics for meat production is linked to the evolution of superbugs, raising the spectre of a health “apocalypse” that could mean even routine operations become life-threatening.Batters will say: “In Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Malaysia and India, the use of antibiotics is permitted for growth promotion. This isn’t just about chlorinated chicken. This is about a wider principle.”Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of the Sustain alliance for better food and farming, accused the government of betraying consumers. “Just last year George Eustice said US imports would have to conform to ‘British law and British standards’ or the US could ‘kiss goodbye to any trade deal and join the back of the queue’,” she said.“Now, it seems he is prepared to bend over backwards to make the case for the US and their hormone-injected, acid-washed, antibiotic-intensive, low-welfare chicken. This is an outrageous betrayal of the British people and deeply worrying for our farmers. The government should be leading the way in high-quality, high-welfare food, not softening up the public to make low-grade food more palatable.”A government spokesperson said: “We have repeatedly been clear that we will uphold our high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards outside the EU. The government will stand firm in trade negotiations to ensure our future trade deals live up to the values of farmers and consumers across the UK.”Eustice is expected to use his speech to the conference on Wednesday morning to launch a consultation on the future of farm subsidies after the UK leaves the EU.“We can all agree that we want British farming to be sustainable in the truest sense of the word, an industry which is profitable, competitive and productive while feeding the nation and taking care of our landscapes too,” he will say.In the agriculture bill progressing through parliament, farmers have been promised a new system of environmental land management contracts, which will reward them for measures to protect public goods, such as water and air quality, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and preserving wildlife and nature.However, campaigners are concerned it contains many loopholes, which will reduce the environmental protections currently in operation under EU regulations.Farmers and land managers will have 10 weeks to respond to the government’s proposals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5fc3ccb5998cd82cf01d7e25f7903fc46fd1729/62_18_1251_751/master/1251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3520d1f5ae0165eb15ba21f2a8d5b82e","title":"how no take zones revived one devastated scottish fishery isle of arran","story":"Protecting the waters around the Isle of Arran against destructive trawling has led to a massive revival in marine species including king scallops, cod and lobstersAfter the government allowed trawlers to come closer to Scottish shores in 1984, the marine ecosystem around the Isle of Arran steadily collapsed, as bottom-trawlers and dredgers intensively combed the seabed with their vibrating spikes.Now, more than 30 years later and following the interventions of local residents, there has been a dramatic revival in species of mollusks and finfish.A “no-take zone” implemented here in 2008 – after a community-based campaign to lobby the Scottish government – has been a huge success, according to a new report that shows a substantial increase in bioersity.Lobsters are now over four times more abundant in the no-take zone, a 2.67 sq km area where fishing is not allowed, than in adjacent areas. The research, led by the University of York, shows king scallop density is four times higher than in 2013, carbon-absorbing weeds have returned to the seabed, and the area is now a nursery for juvenile fish, especially cod. The lobsters in the zone produce six times more eggs than outside it.“The seabed habitats are springing up,” says Howard Wood, co-founder of the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (Coast). “Without destructive forms of fishing, this amazing, complex seabed allows more species to inhabit, hide and feed. You can see what happens when nature is allowed to thrive.”Wood, a er who was awarded an OBE for services to the environment, led the successful lobbying for no-take zones along with fellow local resident Don MacNeish, who witnessed their transformative effect in New Zealand. Now they are calling for Holyrood and Westminster to sanction more no-take zones around the UK.In contrast to humans, who become less fertile as they grow older, many species of fish spend more of their energy producing eggs as they age. This is one reason proponents say no-take zones – also known as highly protected marine areas (HPMAs) – are so crucial to allowing species repopulation.There are currently four such zones in the UK: in the Medway estuary, at Flamborough Head on the north Yorkshire coast, and near Lundy island, Devon – which has seen a remarkable rise in the lobster population.The UK government is currently examining whether to introduce no-take zones in vulnerable English sea areas, with a review due to be published this spring. There are already about 350 marine protection areas, but as they allow fishing, many observers think they do little to improve degraded ecosystems.“We have thousands of square kilometres of ‘paper parks’, which give the appearance of protection but do little in practice,” says Jean-Luc Solandt of the Marine Conservation Society. “It is the unfortunate case that the government is doing very little to protect our seas.”Trawling, for instance, is banned in MPAs, but there are many reports that this is not effectively enforced. “People are fishing with impunity and we find it flabbergasting that the protected areas are not actually protected,” says Solandt.Last month, marine conservation charity Open Seas accused the Scottish government of “sitting on its hands in the wake of repeated instances of illegal scallop dredging” in MPA’s.But the £120m sector employs about 600 people directly, and another 750 in processing jobs, meaning any further changes would inevitably put some people out of work.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs blamed the EU for the failures in marine conservation. “Currently the Common Fisheries Policy restricts our ability to implement tougher protections but leaving the EU and taking back control of our waters as an independent coastal state gives us the opportunity to introduce stronger measures,” she says.“Targeted HPMAs could complement the existing network of MPAs and allow vulnerable marine wildlife to fully recover, free from all damaging human activities, with the aim of leaving nature in a better state than we found it.”In New Zealand, Australia, the US and elsewhere, large parts of the sea are subject to comprehensive fishing bans.Such zones should be expanded to at least one-quarter of all UK waters, say conservationists. This would allow stocks of fish such as North Sea cod – which have fallen by almost a third since 2015 – to replenish.He says it will not matter how many crabs and lobsters live in the sea if coastal communities cannot make a living from them.But it is precisely the interests of the community that Wood has in mind. “Coast’s most important message is that any environment can benefit from better protection, and every community has the right to a better environment if they want one,” he says.“If that is embraced on a global scale then we truly will see a sea change in the health of our seas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e038ad3240bff4bb928f1d84ff0ef4d6b3628a41/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b8f170d5db58e457d6e79305ab87e35","title":"newly waterproofed arctic seed vault 1m samples climate change","story":"Rapid climate change forced urgent upgrade of ‘failsafe’ doomsday storage facilityThe Arctic global seed vault has reached the milestone of having 1m varieties stored in its deep freeze. The new deposits are being made after unexpected flooding of its entrance tunnel in 2017 prompted an upgrade.Seeds from 60,000 crop varieties from across the world are being placed in the vault to back up those held in other seed banks.Now, a €20m refurbishment by the Norwegian government means the vault is secure for the future and “absolutely watertight”, according to officials.The destruction of nature means vital ersity of crops and their wild relatives are being lost, at a time when the impact of the climate emergency means new varieties are needed to cope with changing weather and pests. Seed banks can also be destroyed by power loss and war, as happened in Aleppo, Syria, making the Svalbard vault crucial.Tuesday’s deposits, from 36 institutions, are the most erse and include seeds of 27 wild plants from Prince Charles’s Highgrove estateas well as seeds of the candy roaster squash, which are being deposited by the Cherokee Nation in the US.Wild emmer wheat, known as the “mother of wheat” when it was discovered in 1906, is being deposited by Haifa University in Israel, alongside potato varieties from Peru and other crops from Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar and New Zealand. Each sample contains roughly 500 seeds.The Svalbard vault, which is carved into solid rock, houses samples of about 1,050,000 crop varieties from 5,000 species. This represents two-fifths of the estimated 2.4m varieties in the world, and the vault has plenty of room to accommodate them.“Crop ersity is an essential basis of food production,” said Hannes Dempewolf, a scientist at Crop Trust, which operates the vault alongside the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre. “And the Svalbard vault is the essential backup facility for seed banks around the world, safeguarding the bioersity they hold.”“The issue of some water intrusion in the entrance tunnel was certainly not foreseen during construction,” Dempewolf said. “No one thought summers would be so warm.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”.

In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.“A major upgrade was the only right thing to do and the Norwegian government has certainly put the resources up to make sure that it is absolutely watertight now.”Hege Njaa Aschim, a spokeswoman for the government, which owns the vault, said: “The entrance tunnel and the upgrade will secure the seed vault for the future.”The 130-metre entrance tunnel has been fully waterproofed and the cooling equipment that keeps the vault at -18C moved to a new service building, so heat from the machinery can be released outside. The vault is 130 metres above sea level and designed for a “virtually infinite lifetime”.“It is always dangerous to talk about something being completely failsafe and impregnable,” Dempewolf said. “In 20, 30, 40 years down the line, we will continue to monitor the situation to see whether any other upgrades are necessary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b27b38b5741dcace3188623572dee1e3f2084d/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3134c3d90564ffe4e221e35f304e2c10","title":"the end of farming rewilding intensive agriculture food safety","story":"For decades, the way we farm has been degrading land and destroying wildlife. Now there’s a revolution coming – but is it going to create more problems than it solves? By  Christopher de BellaigueIn the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives soon there would be no seed source for the next generation.Between 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen – and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie’s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended.In 2006, the billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, the last and richest of the three Danes, whose fashion empire includes the online retail giant Asos, bought Glenfeshie. Urged on by his man on the ground, a former land agent called Thomas MacDonell, he intensified efforts that had started under his predecessor to bring down deer numbers, with a view to allowing the estate’s woodland to recover and bioersity to return.Glenfeshie is the biggest of the 12 Scottish estates that Povlsen and his wife Anne began acquiring and rewilding in 1996 – in the process spending a total of £70m and becoming the country’s largest private landowners. Although the term “rewilding” – meaning an approach to conservation that allows nature a free rein – has been in currency since 1990, many traditional landowners and gamekeepers continue to spurn both the term and the idea behind it. In the Highlands, rewilding implies that the concept of the country estate as a setting for people of quality to shoot game has had its time. Never very profitable – the Highlands were where rich people came to spend money they had made elsewhere – in recent decades, the sporting estates have become still less viable. As one veteran gamekeeper told me, very few of them actually make money.By 2013, MacDonell and his team had culled 8,000 deer at Glenfeshie, and his local opponents, among them a neighbouring deerstalking enterprise, had camped on the moral high ground. “When they shoot deer they call it sport,” MacDonell said wryly when I visited him last September, “and when we shoot deer they call it slaughter. Also, they claimed it would take hundreds of years for the woodland to regenerate.”We were standing on a track overlooking the River Feshie. On either side, young Scots pines displayed bright green needles against the glowing heather. Among the pines grew rowans hung with scarlet berries, and bilberry bushes whose leaves would be fair game for white moth caterpillars in spring. There were more new trees on the far side of the Feshie, binding the banks and spreading up the hillside. MacDonell smiled. “As you can see, our opponents were wrong.”Over the past 20 years or so, from South America to the Danube basin, ad hoc coalitions of politicians, activists and conscience-stricken billionaires (whose core activities, such as Povlsen’s clothing business, are often less than environmentally friendly), have rewilded millions of acres of mostly failed agricultural and grazing land. Their guiding philosophy – that we should leave the land alone – upends the long dominant view that land should be cleared, ploughed and wrung ever more efficiently for food.Because many of the practitioners are billionaires, and because the landscapes they have returned to nature are (no matter who owns them on paper) our cherished inheritance, and because of a deeply held tradition of depending on the land for food, rewilding attracts controversy. But it is based on a longer view of the planet’s health, which dictates that we use the land not only to feed ourselves in a more environmentally sustainable way, but also to capture greenhouse gases, save endangered species and offer ourselves an occasional break from traffic and hand-sanitisers – that is, to leave town and enjoy the works of nature.The regeneration of Glenfeshie is such a work. Across the hills that ide the Feshie’s catchment from that of the neighbouring river, the Tromie, MacDonell and his team have planted hundreds of thousands of pines, birches, willows and other native trees over the past decade. A few years from now, these stems will develop into a barrier against erosion, a carbon sink and a habitat for distinctive Highland birds such as the capercaillie and ptarmigan. Birds and the wind distribute seeds, while the estate’s deer, whose concentration has been brought down from 40 per sq km to one, are no longer numerous enough to eat all the young shoots. The increased vegetation also provides food for the pine martens, red squirrels and mountain hares that MacDonell is seeing in rising numbers, while the population of endangered birds such as crossbills and crested tits has also risen.For whose benefit? The Povlsens’ Scottish operations currently make an annual loss of £3m, but it is hoped that they will turn a profit by 2027, thanks to clients paying to stay in luxurious accommodation, enjoy exquisitely underdone venison and wander the restored landscapes. When rewilding plans were first revealed, critics of Scotland’s concentrated land ownership – half of the Scottish countryside is owned by around 450 people – expressed fears that Glenfeshie might become a reservation for the rich, but these have been partially allayed by letting ordinary hikers walk across the glens for free.If rewilding seems like a rich person’s indulgence, this is because its economic viability is unproven. It is also a misnomer, for whether by getting rid of tens of thousands of sheep in Patagonia or introducing a living species as a surrogate for an extinct one – Sayaguesa cattle in place of aurochs in Croatia’s Velebit Mountains, for instance – rewilding requires more human intervention than its name suggests. The tourism it offers is limited a rewilded area cannot accommodate many people without undermining its own existence. By erting investment towards repairing landscapes and contributing to the public weal, rewilders are taking money away from conventional economic activities. And this is where its impact will be felt in British farming. Barely a decade ago, the notion that land should be managed in order to ensure planetary wellbeing had few takers among farmers whose raison d’etre was to fill human bellies at the lowest possible cost. But this is the proposition that is now poised to determine the future of farming.Memories of resilience in adversity were inevitably a factor in the growth of intensive farming. When the country was blockaded during the second world war and the nation’s farmers were told to convert scrub and pasture to sown fields, arable land doubled. In peacetime, the patriotic drive for self-sufficiency continued, as the population soared and farmers cleared more land in order to produce more food. Between 1946 and 1963, an average of 3,000 miles of hedgerows were stripped out each year.After Britain joined the European Community in 1973, its farmers received subsidies that rewarded production and – when that led to wasteful surpluses – simply for holding farmland. In 2017, some £2.73bn was disbursed in this way. For decades, farmers justified their subsidies by citing the continuing need for British self-sufficiency in food production, despite the fact that in many cases they were only solvent thanks to European subsidies. During that time, there was still only minimal awareness that the relentless drive for higher yields through intensive methods might be bad for the environment. The few farmers who questioned the prevailing wisdom faced ostracism by their peers.So Charles Burrell discovered in 2000, when he declared defeat after a decade and a half of intensive farming at Knepp, his 1,400-hectare estate in the south of England. Burrell had invested in automatic feeding systems, state-of-the-art combine harvesters and gallons of fertilisers and pesticides in order to coax more milk from his cows and higher yields from the stodgy Sussex clay. But for 13 of his 15 years in charge, Burrell sank more money into the farm than he received in revenues, and the estate was £1.5m overdrawn. In February 2000, he told his employees that he was coming out of farming.“The farm workers … left the office grimly shaking their heads,” his wife, Isabella Tree, recalled in Wilding, the book she wrote about the couple’s experiences. But if liquidation was shocking, Burrell’s decision to seek public money to turn his farm into a “bioerse wilderness”, and his aim to turn a profit through tourism and organic meat, seemed downright perverse.In 2001, starting with a small section of the estate and gradually expanding as funding became available, Burrell stopped ploughing the land and spraying it with chemicals. Removing internal fences allowed the wild Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs he introduced to browse and rootle over large distances, their disruptions creating habitats for other animals and plants. Dung beetles ed into delicious organic cowpats left by longhorn cattle that hadn’t been fed wormers and parasiticides voles colonised the roots of a dead oak that under the previous regime would have been felled in the interests of tidiness. The summer of 2002 revealed wildflowers with delightful names such as bird’s-foot trefoil and lady’s bedstraw that hadn’t been seen in such numbers for a generation, along with a profusion of insects, which produced a continuous thrum – “something”, in Tree’s words, “we hadn’t even known we’d been missing”.Much bigger and more ambitious rewilding schemes than Knepp are currently underway across Europe. But whatever the challenges that face international conservationists who are restoring the largely abandoned Coa Valley of northern Portugal, or those at work in Swedish Lapland (population: 1,000), mass hostility from the locals isn’t one of them. Rewilding in the densely populated Sussex Weald was a tougher sell.In August 2003, Burrell invited local farmers to Knepp with the aim of converting them to the project. As he laid out his vision of fields and hedges devolving into scrub and wetland, his audience erupted with anger. “It wasn’t simply that our neighbours (including some other members of the family) thought this wasn’t right for them,” Tree wrote. “It was more visceral … an affront to the efforts of every self-respecting farmer, an immoral waste of land, an assault on Britishness itself.”By 2008, Knepp was suffused by weeds such as ragwort, whose vivid yellow flowers are great for pollinators but can kill livestock in the rare event that they are eaten in large amounts. In a letter to the West Sussex County Times, a critic resorted to doggerel to denounce Knepp’s “ragwort shame, spread like the plague, and who’s to blame?”When I visited Knepp after heavy rain last autumn, what had been arable fields were a sodden mishmash of young trees, billowing hedges and fleabane stalks, naturally occurring growths that have enhanced Knepp’s capacity for carbon capture. In 2011, Burrell had deliberately collapsed the banks of the River Adur where it runs through his property in order to create the kind of accommodating plain that floods harmlessly after heavy rain.Burrell’s flood-plain and the ramblers’ paths that criss-cross the estate constitute what the government defines as “public goods”: services provided to society without material profit. They have helped quiet much of the local opposition to Knepp’s rewilding. Meanwhile, wildlife tourism has turned Knepp into a successful business that employs more people than it did when it was a farm. Springtime overnighters snuggling down in a luxury treehouse after a soak in the open-air, wood-fired Swedish Hikki bathtub may hear nightingales serenading their consorts they can take home organic Knepp chops to remember the free-running Tamworths by. Tree’s book Wilding has sold so well that its author recently appeared on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, an indication of impending national treasure status.Burrell is nowadays asked about his methods by farmers from around the country. But Knepp is not easy to emulate its success lies partly in its rarity and its aristocratic charm – Burrell is a baronet who lives in a rinky-dink castle. Nor are the farmers who consult him necessarily converts to rewilding. As Burrell himself says: “These guys may not like it, but they don’t know what the future holds and are being forced to engage.”At present, in addition to the EU subsidy they receive for holding agricultural land, farmers who provide public goods, such as fostering wildflowers and mitigating flood risk, can claim EU environmental subsidies. But take-up has been patchy between 2014 and 2017, environmental disbursals fell from £489m to £399m, a reflection of what farmers call the government’s overly prescriptive approach.The brutal fact is that government policy is about to get a lot more prescriptive. With Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the government is scrapping the subsidy system which has kept British farming in stasis for years – and on which the livelihoods of many thousands depend. Under the agriculture bill currently before parliament, subsidies will be redirected at public goods alone. If a farmer does not provide such services, they will have to live off sales of their produce. This may not be a problem for the UK’s bigger farming companies, but impossible for many of the smaller family-owned enterprises whose annual subsidy is currently all that keeps them from insolvency.Hence the queue of worried farmers outside Burrell’s door. Knepp may hold the secret to rehabilitating the tarnished name of British farming. The more candid of the country’s farmers admit that they have suffered a calamitous fall in public esteem. From being the devoted fillers of the nation’s larders and the custodians of rural heritage, farmers, as one lamented to me, are increasingly seen as people who “take public money while raping the land”.Intensive arable farming is designed to raise yields and eliminate pests and disease. The more fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are used, the bigger the harvests. Back in the chemical-free, weed-infested 1940s, Charles Burrell’s great-grandfather was lucky if he got two tonnes of wheat per hectare. Nowadays, farmers using high-yielding varieties would expect to harvest 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare, usually after applying pesticides, ammonium nitrate fertiliser, and a sprinkling of Roundup – a weedkiller found to have caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma among farmers. Overlooking their carcinogenic properties, the right chemicals – and the right weather – bring amazing results. In 2015, a farmer from Northumberland posted a yield of 16.52 tonnes per hectare, winning him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.For all the role that chemicals have played in improving yields, creating a loyal customer base among many of Britain’s 17,000-odd farms, there is a growing appreciation of the long-term environmental damage they cause. With repeated application over several years, chemicals kill the tiny mycorrhizal fungi that supply roots with water and nutrients, as well as earthworms that provide aeration and improve drainage.Guided by Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who advises the government on farming policy, the political establishment has become decidedly sceptical of the old benign image of British farming. Last year, Helm called for the “full scale of the disaster of British agriculture” to be recognised, adding that “no other economic activity combines such a perverse set of incentives, or produces so little value for its true costs”.Even sheep-farming, celebrated by William Wordsworth as a symbol of rural plenitude, is nowadays described as an ecological disaster by writers and activists such as George Monbiot, who argues that the only hope for Britain’s “sheep-wrecked” hills is to reforest them and get rid of ruminants altogether.Converts to the new scepticism include Michael Gove, who, as environment secretary in Theresa May’s government, had a big hand in drafting the agriculture bill currently being scrutinised by MPs. Even the National Farmers Union has committed its members to going carbon-neutral by 2040 – though that goal may only be attainable through as yet undeveloped carbon capture technologies.The agriculture bill sits snugly alongside the government’s environment bill, another Gove baby, which had its first parliamentary reading in January and will enshrine the so-called “polluter pays” principle, according to which dirty industries are penalised at source. No longer can farmers who use chemicals that run into rivers expect water companies and the fishing industry to pick up the bill. Instead, the use of chemicals will be priced according to the greenhouse gases that are emitted while making them and the cost of clearing up the mess they cause – though the vexed question of exactly how the costs will be spread has yet to be resolved.The change that is coming over farming can be summarised in simple economic terms. Intensive agriculture prioritises a bumper harvest – the annual idend – while the new approach emphasises the preservation of the initial capital – the land itself. For a glimpse of how this new investment priority will affect British farming, it suffices to visit those progressives who have already, to varying degrees, made it their own.One afternoon last September, John and Paul Cherry invited me on to their Hertfordshire farm to show how to regenerate damaged soil. Until 10 years ago, each autumn the brothers would laboriously turn over lifeless slabs of clay, which needed to be pulverised with a power harrow before sowing could begin. Then they would douse the land with chemicals to coax forth an unwilling wheat crop. “It was as if we were in a battle with nature,” Paul said.In the 1990s, following innovators in the US midwest, a handful of British farmers went organic or stopped ploughing the soil to make a seed bed (so-called “no-tillers”). In 2010, the Cherrys followed suit, planting cover crops such as clover to reduce soil erosion and lock in carbon over the winter, and cutting their use of chemicals. “That brought us much closer to what nature would have us do,” said John as he poured some crumbling, friable soil reverentially into my hand, pausing to point out some “lovely” wormholes. “It’s a miniature rainforest,” he went on, “with more living things in it than there are people on the planet, full of bacteria and protozoa that are feasting off each other and interacting with the roots of the plant.”Standing on black, peaty ground in the shadow of Ely Cathedral, Clarke pointed out his neighbour’s field, which had been ploughed and was bare up to the dyke that ides the two properties. Clarke’s side, by contrast, featured a 10-metre margin of fodder radishes and wildflowers, a combination that provides pollen for bees and seeds for the grey partridges and corn buntings whose food sources have been depleted by intensive farming. When Clarke was a child, his father farmed the same land using intensive methods. Back then, almost the only wildlife to be seen was “thousands of rabbits.”From Ely, I drove south-east to a farm in Suffolk where Brian and Patrick Barker showed me how they are preparing for the introduction of the “polluter pays” laws. One of the cousins’ fields had been split into two strips, the first left bare after harvest, the second planted with phacelia, rye and radish. Over the winter, these “catch-crops” are left in the ground, where they capture the residual potash and nitrates from last year’s crop in their roots and stop them polluting nearby streams. At the end of the trial period, a comparison will be done between run-off from the two strips, and the catch-crops’ efficacy will be measured. Under the government’s new subsidy regime, environmentalism and economics will – in theory – perfectly align.The Barkers have started bringing livestock on to their fields to provide natural fertiliser – a nod to the old practice of “mixed” farming, whereby farmers grew crops and kept livestock, which went out with intensive methods. Brian told me that he had listened to Isabella Tree’s book Wilding twice while he was manoeuvring his combine harvester around the fields. He found it interesting, “but if everywhere was Knepp we’d have a lot of wildlife and not a lot else”.Every British farmer I spoke to while researching this article has an opinion on what the Burrells have done at Knepp, even if it is to damn the enterprise as tokenistic and unproductive. Environmentally friendly regeneration still has formidable opponents, among them old-school intensive farmers and the agribusinesses that make seeds and chemicals, as well as some plant scientists. In their view, a single unpalatable truth trumps any number of bees and buntings – and that is the looming global dearth of food.For Bill Clark, the technical director of the National Institute of Plant Botany (Niab), a research institute funded by some of Britain’s biggest farming enterprises, this means increasing yields. Clark regards the dispute over whether soil should be productive or healthy as a distraction from the basic choice between being able to feed people or not. “If yields don’t rise,” he told me at Niab’s headquarters in Cambridge, “people in north Africa” – a major export market for European farmers – “won’t simply be unable to afford the wheat they need in order to live: there will be no wheat.”To Clark’s dismay, precisely at the point when Britain and the rest of Europe need a productivity spurt in order to export more to the world, yields have plateaued, thanks to what Clark called the “irrational dogma which says that technology is bad”.Clark is a believer in the power of science to improve the human lot. In his view we have become so blase about technological advance that we overlook the fact that science has saved countless people from starvation. He spoke with reverence of the revolution that highly fertile Japanese wheat wrought when it was crossed with European varieties in the 50s: “The plant halved in size but yields doubled.” Visit one of Niab’s walk-in growth chambers and you’ll see the newest miracle: wheat developed by using a gene from oats that confers immunity to the root disease known as take-all. The new strain can be sown in successive years on the same field without falling foul of the disease (conventional practice dictates that the way to avoid take-all is to plant wheat in rotation with different crops, which naturally lowers aggregate wheat production).It is possible that there is one particular sector of farmers who will not be overly affected by the new agriculture bill. Where economies of size combine with naturally fertile soil that hasn’t yet been destroyed by chemicals, intensive farming continues to be remunerative.Michael Sly’s family has been farming around the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, since the civil war, buying and selling land until Park Farm – as the Sly establishment is called – reached its present size of 1,600 hectares. Whether it is the annual service of thanksgiving he organises at harvest festival, the thousands who visit Park Farm on “open farm” weekend in June, or his chairmanship of the local history society, Sly enjoys the status of – his words – “a big commercial arable farmer”. And while he is proud of the margins he has set aside for bees and birds, Sly’s mission isn’t environmental services. It’s growing food.Sly’s professional vision is defined by his huge fields of sugar beet that stretch towards the horizon, his state-of-the-art tractors, seed drills and combine harvesters, each of which is worth “multiple tens of thousands of pounds”, and his contracts to supply premium grade wheat for national brands such as Weetabix and Mini-Cheddars. He regards wilding as relevant only to “a certain percentage of affluent society”, and his shiny new 2,000-tonne store – which bulged with grains when I visited – is a hymn to the mass market.Sly refuses to commit to techniques such as cover cropping or no-tillage that might reduce yields, and whose commercial viability is unproven. (For all the worms wriggling in their soils, the Cherry brothers’ farming operation is loss-making, and will probably remain so until subsidy reforms kick in.) Sly’s worry is that once Britain has left the EU, the government will remove tariffs on imported produce grown using neonicotinoids or GM, undercutting British farmers. (Britain already imports half its food. When UK oilseed rape yields plummeted following the neonicotinoid insecticide ban, the shortfall was made up by importing Canadian rapeseed oil that had been produced using the same insecticides.)If there is no discernible panic among your fellow shoppers in the supermarket, this is because the prospect of shortages seems so remote from today’s glut. Isabella Tree contrasts the calls of “retailers, agribusiness and farmers’ unions” for the production of more food with “the experiences of farmers like ourselves, driven out of business by … low commodity prices resulting from subsidies and over-production”. Governments of neither left or right dare contemplate measures, such as imposing VAT on food, that would encourage thrift.While the debate continues over the use of advanced genetic and chemical crop-enhancers, technology is opening a whole new direction for food production, which will take farming away from the farm. Robotics and drones are reducing the need for humans to be on the land, while vertical farming, in which vegetables can be grown in sunless warehouses using LED lighting, gene editing and metagenics – the engineering of specific enzymes or proteins – are coming up with new definitions of food. According to a recent report by the thinktank RethinkX, within 15 years the rise of cell-based meat, which is made of animal cells grown in a bioreactor, will bankrupt the US’s huge beef industry, at the same time removing the need to grow soya and maize for feed. By 2035, the report predicts, an area a quarter of the size of the continental US “will be freed for other uses”.Although South American countries such as Brazil and Paraguay are expected to add 11m hectares to the global agricultural inventory between 2018 and 2027, in part by destroying the rainforests, agriculture’s footprint in the developed world is already decreasing, with “more land now being abandoned from agriculture than converted to it”, according to a recent study by the University of Minnesota. Already, as parliament has heard, a lot of British hill farmers are not being replaced when they retire. As a child in London, I heard my mother’s stories of growing up as the daughter of farmers on the Canadian Prairies. There was no Roundup weedkiller, though I’m sure my mother and her siblings, bent double to pick weeds from a field of mustard, would have appreciated it. For my own children, urbanites to their bones, their grandmother’s upbringing must be hard to conceive. Farming is retreating even from the imaginative capacity of most Britons.That many farmers confess to being confused and worried about their future is hardly surprising. The new measures will have a seven-year phasing-in period, at the end of which some of the small farmers who have been unable to adapt will go bust. What is to stop their land being swallowed up by big intensive farmers who don’t rely on subsidies? Others, rather than manoeuvre themselves through the hoops erected by public goods, may decide to turn their land over to enterprises less favourable to dormice and goldfinches: go-karting, motorbike scrambling or parcel distribution.A sentiment I heard repeatedly runs like this: farmers will do whatever society wants them to do, but the sums (ie, the subsidies, or market forces) have to be right.Even if the claims contained in the RethinkX report are overblown, a transformation of the kind it outlines seems not only possible but desirable. When I met him last autumn in a converted warehouse, now a restaurant, in London’s Kings Cross, Tony Juniper, the government’s chief adviser on the natural environment and a former head of Friends of the Earth, described a future in which the cost of LED bulbs is more significant to farmers than a late frost, and Londoners think nothing of weekending among lynxes and beavers in a rewilded green belt.Britain’s farming community is a tiny minority whose public influence is in terminal decline, and is destined to shrink further as technology requires fewer and fewer people to muddy themselves for a living. “The killer irony” of the revolution in farming, said Juniper, in a building that used to receive sack upon sack of golden English wheat, “is that farmers may not be around to see it.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b87eee384507d49a79a828fffc80b7eed7501313/23_1159_6247_3750/master/6247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8490b0cfd18f3aa6dd40af60b009cb6e","title":"uk lags behind in 124bn european low carbon investment table","story":"A report has revealed that German-listed companies invested 11 times more in low-carbon investments such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and smart energy grids than UK firms.London-listed companies spent €4bn on green research and technologies compared with €44.4bn from German groups, including the carmaker Volkswagen, which invested more than a third of Europe’s total low-carbon spending in 2019.The report, from the climate disclosure organisation CDP, said Germany, Spain and Italy topped the company league table for low-carbon investment last year while the UK finished sixth, below France and Denmark.The report, which was co-authored by the global management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, reflected well on countries that are home to major manufacturers and utilities that have made heavy investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy projects in the last year.By contrast, UK companies did not fare as well in the investment rankings because much of the country’s green infrastructure spending is outsourced to foreign companies, including Spain’s Iberdrola, the owner of Scottish Power, and the Danish wind power giant Ørsted.The report warned that despite the €124bn investment in green solutions across the continent, low-carbon spending will need to double if Europe hopes to meet its climate targets.UK and EU leaders have agreed to be climate neutral, or “net zero”, by 2050 in a bid to keep global temperatures from climbing to levels that could lead to catastrophic climate chaos.He said: “The investment decisions taken by European companies and their owners will make or break whether we are successful – and they need to double down.” The report found that almost 900 listed European companies invested a total of €59bn in new low-carbon capital investments and €65bn in research and development last year.The biggest areas of new investment were in research and development of electric vehicle technologies, which reached €43bn across Europe, and capital investment in renewable energy, which reached €16bn. Investment in energy grid infrastructure and smart energy technology climbed to €15bn and €8bn respectively.“Across many types of investment, the business case for transitioning businesses on to a low-carbon pathway is clear and the opportunities vast,” Tebbe said.The CDP estimates that the potential value of Europe’s new low-carbon business opportunities could reach €1.22tn – more than six times the €192bn of green investment required to realise this financial benefit.“But overall current investment levels are still short of putting European firms on track for net zero emissions,” he said.“For industries where decarbonisation is more challenging, there is a serious need for financial markets and policymakers to create better conditions for low-carbon investment and deliver stronger incentives to drive investment into breakthrough technologies, where capital expenditure is often high and returns long-term.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e239a2c90fa1259a7b261afa1903462090987682/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4aace71e51e6dc2b8b49766e9f12404","title":"bohai bay the chinese region disappearing inch by inch in pictures","story":"Farmland, abandoned seaside resorts and salt fields are slowly being claimed by the rising waters, with 100 million people predicted to be affected in China by 2050All photographs by Sean Gallagher for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6117a6330b12a6ab96f074459bd9fdc6903fa665/158_381_6208_3725/master/6208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e148d53ac01676a85dbdd557e2000c8","title":"mens makeup share your experiences","story":"We would like to hear about men’s experiences of wearing makeup, and their reasons for doing soIt’s not the first makeup brand for men Tom Ford, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel also sell male cosmetics, and some forecasters predict that one in four men will use some type of makeup within five years.We’d like to hear from men who wear cosmetics about their experiences.Are you a man who wears makeup?

The jury on Monday found him guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and of rape in the third degree. He was acquitted of three further charges, including the two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault and an alternative count of rape in the first degree.The highly anticipated trial included a colorful set of characters. Weinstein himself turned up to court every day, using a walker because of a car accident over the summer. His team was led by Donna Rotunno, a Chicago-based attorney known for defending men accused of sexual assault. Prosecuting was Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, a New York assistant district attorney with a fierce reputation.Here are some key moments from the trial: The typically mild-mannered James Burke, the judge presiding over Weinstein’s case, furiously admonished Weinstein for using his cellphone in the courtroom as proceedings took place early on in the trial.“Is this really the way you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life – by texting in violation of a court order?” Burke asked Weinstein.Burke told Arthur Aidala, one of Weinstein’s lawyers, that Weinstein’s $2m bail would be revoked if the former producer was caught using his phone again. Weinstein’s team later argued that Burke was biased when he said that Weinstein would end up in jail for life as it showed that the judge believed he would be convicted.Burke promptly denied the claim of bias. “All I meant to do was scare him enough for him to discontinue using his phone,” he told the courtroom.The beginning of Weinstein’s trial was marked by two protests held within the first week of the trial.On the first day, a group of about two dozen women silently held signs with slogans such as “Justice for Survivors” and glared at Weinstein as he walked into the courthouse. Soon after his arrival, the group, who call themselves the Silence Breakers, held a press conference across the street from the courthouse to commemorate the beginning of the trial. A few days later, another group of women performed outside the courthouse Un Violador en Tu Camino (A Rapist in Your Path), the Chilean anti-rape anthem. “The patriarchy is a judge that judges us for being born, and our punishment is the violence we have seen,” the women chanted in English and Spanish.The flashmob protest could be heard from inside the courtroom. Weinstein’s attorneys argued that the protest would bias potential jurors. Burke, the judge, responded by saying the sound of the chanting was faint and that it would not be the only protest to take place during the trial.Model Gigi Hadid was one of hundreds of potential jurors who were called into Weinstein’s trial during the jury selection stage. When asked if she knew Weinstein, Hadid said that she had met him before. She also said that she was friends with Salma Hayek, an actor who has accused Weinstein of sexual harassment. Hadid is also known to be friends with Cara Delevingne, who has also accused Weinstein of harassment.When the judge asked Hadid if she could be impartial during the trial, she said: “I think I’m still able to keep an open mind about the facts.” She took home a written juror survey but was promptly dismissed when she showed up to court again later in the week.Weinstein’s defense team said Hadid’s appearance proved Manhattan has too much of a “carnival-like atmosphere” to hold the trial and requested that it be moved to a county further away from New York City. The judge denied the request.Actor Annabella Sciorra, the most high-profile witness of the six women who testified for the case, was the first of Weinstein’s accusers to testify and re-enacted how Weinstein pinned her arms above her head when he assaulted her in the early 1990s.“He took my hands and put them over my head to hold them back,” she said as she held her hands above her head, looking at the jury as she described the moment. “Then he got on top of me and raped me.”While describing the incident, Sciorra’s voice broke and she frequently dabbed her eyes with tissue. Sciorra openly cried when she told the jury what Weinstein told her after he ejaculated on her nightgown: “I have perfect timing.”After the incident, Sciorra said she became depressed and resorted to drinking and cutting herself to numb the pain.During the second day of cross examination for one of the trial’s two main witnesses, the witness broke down into uncontrollable sobbing as she attempted to read out loud a letter she wrote to her boyfriend at the time about the relationship she had with Weinstein. The judge ended the court session that day as the witness appeared inconsolable.By that point, the jury had seen the witness break down multiple times as she described the relationship she had with Weinstein, whom she described as “Jekyll and Hyde” – someone who was charming and could lift you up but bring you down when not given what he wants.The witness alleges that Weinstein raped her twice in 2013, though the two maintained a complex relationship that was, at times, consensual. Weinstein’s defense team alleges that all sexual interactions they had were consensual, as evidenced by future interactions Weinstein and the witness had after the alleged assaults is not naming her because she has not indicated publicly whether prefers to be identified.Pieces of evidence the court brought out for jurors, but not shown to the entire courtroom, were what appeared to be photos of Weinstein naked, according to the renderings of court sketch artists.Before the photos were given to the jury, Weinstein’s defense team tried to strike down the images as evidence, saying they were “irrelevant”. But the prosecution prevailed and the jurors passed around the pictures, some only quickly glancing down at them before passing them to the person next to them.Two witnesses gave intimate details to the courtroom about Weinstein’s physical features. One of the main witnesses said that Weinstein appeared to have a large scar on his body, like he had been burned. She also said that he did not appear to have testicles. A second witness also said that he had severe scarring and that she “didn’t really see balls in a sack”.During her closing arguments, Rotunno said that showing the nude photos to the jury was an attempt to “shame” Weinstein.During the cross-examination of Lauren Young, a “prior bad acts” witness, Weinstein’s lawyer Damon Cheronis put on a pair of gloves and held up a white lace dress – the one that Young claims she wore the night Weinstein assaulted her in 2013. Young said that she had not touched the dress since that night.Young described to the jury how Weinstein trapped her in a hotel bathroom, pulled down her dress, groped her breast and masturbated in front of her, saying: “This is what all the actresses do to make it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ba770a1804365e1b7b648770d980bdff2326f43/0_51_3998_2399/master/3998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dc32a871bdd2476ef289fc77e6c96f4","title":"director richard stanley interview color out of space","story":"His new movie stars Nicolas Cage as an alien-fighting alpaca farmer. But the maverick film-maker’s life story might be even trippierExtraordinary stories tumble out of Richard Stanley’s mouth – absurdist adventures from far-off lands, anecdotes involving ghosts and warlocks – all delivered with a mischievous matter-of-factness. One minute, he is talking about a short film he directed after a glow-in-the-dark Ouija board from Toys “R” Us dictated the plot to him the next, he is remembering a friend who died after doing a ritual to placate “a seemingly fictional deity”. We are ostensibly discussing his new film, Color Out of Space, but it is understandable that he might head off on the odd extended detour it has, after all, been 28 years since he directed a feature.His last attempt was his 1996 adaptation of HG Wells’s The Island of Dr Moreau: a dream project for Stanley that turned into a disaster. The daughter of its star, Marlon Brando, killed herself the day before the Australian shoot, leaving the production in temporary limbo in his absence. Co-star Val Kilmer repeatedly disrespected Stanley. A hurricane almost obliterated the set. Engulfed in chaos, Stanley was fired after just three days of shooting, and replaced by John Frankenheimer. Stanley’s contribution to the film was uncredited. (The whole episode was revisited in the terrific 2014 documentary Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley’s Island of Dr Moreau.)His career in tatters, Stanley retreated to Montségur, an isolated mountain village in southern France. He has lived there ever since, writing scripts, making obscure documentaries and working as a mountain guide, taking tourists to caves and Neolithic remains. Our Skype interview happens two weeks later than scheduled – he didn’t materialise the first time, and I never get to the bottom of his disappearance – but he has finally been pinned down in LA, where he is promoting his film. “I’m in the midst of madness here in Hollywood,” he says, surrounded by crates, in a shack in the hills. The South African-born 53-year-old smokes cigarettes throughout our conversation, his raven-coloured mane spilling out of an Australian Akubra hat. A gothic cowboy of sorts, he is rarely seen without such headgear, looking like a character from any one of his films.Color Out of Space, adapted from horror writer HP Lovecraft’s 1927 short story, is as eccentric as its director: in rural New England, alpaca farmer Nathan (Nicolas Cage) and his family come undone after a meteorite lands in their front yard, precipitating much strange behaviour. Time begins warping, a colour never seen before by human eyes subsumes the environment, and the film hurtles headlong into nightmarish psychedelia, with Cage going full, well, Cage. It’s been a stealth word-of-mouth hit in the US, which is why Stanley is there, still promoting it – “Basically on a revenge tour,” he says, in a nod to his years in exile. The Dr Moreau situation had labelled him an unreliable director, and many comeback attempts had failed. But now, with Color Out of Space’s box-office success, “Hollywood’s been doing the come-hither thing,” he says, not entirely trusting the industry’s overtures. “I’ve been trying to separate dream from reality.” Those borders have blurred throughout his life. His mother, Penny Miller, was an English anthropologist who moved to Africa. After he was born, she spent years travelling the continent, researching her book Myths and Legends of Southern Africa. She took her young son with her, meeting witch doctors and watching goat sacrifices. In his late teens, on the verge of being conscripted, Stanley fled to London, became a British citizen and began directing music videos. Then things took a left turn: in 1989 he moved to Afghanistan to film the Soviet-Afghan war, joined a fundamentalist guerrilla group, and got caught up in the siege of Jalalabad. Eventually he returned to London to direct his first film, killer-robot sci-fi Hardware (1990), which cost $800,000, made a few million, and instantly gave him cult kudos. He followed it with 1992’s pagan horror Dust Devil.Then Dr Moreau happened. After the calamitous shoot, Stanley fled to the rainforest, where he lived on coconuts and cannabis. Later, with Frankenheimer’s production in full flow, some loyal extras ran into Stanley and smuggled him back on to the set, where he disguised himself as one of the story’s dog-people and cavorted about in the background as Frankenheimer filmed. “I was on the island as a dog, trapped in a place which I’d designed,” he reflects. Was there a perverse poetry in that? “Yeah, there seemed to be some kind of Conradian sense of it being appropriate,” he says. “It felt like I’d somehow earned that fate.”The past few years have been rough for him. Having been evicted from his home after a quarrel with a mining company that was “vaporising the mountain”, he moved into “a cabin on a crag” with no electricity. As a Brit in France, his future post-Brexit seems uncertain. “I’ve been facing a few existential challenges. It was feeling very dark at the point when Color Out of Space came over the horizon.”Stanley has been a fan of Lovecraft since he was a kid: by the time he was eight, his mother had read him all of the author’s work. He wrote a script (with co-screenwriter Scarlett Amaris, as he wanted the film to have a female voice) and it was picked up by Elijah Wood’s production company SpectreVision, who had just made trippy 2018 horror Mandy, also starring Cage. The actor was keen to star in this, too a fellow Lovecraft fan, he had almost worked with Stanley on Dust Devil, and thought he would be perfect to attempt to create the story’s alien colour on screen. And so, last year, Stanley found himself directing again.In trying to visualise the extraterrestrial colour, Stanley experimented with hot air, water and temperature changes, “because the monster is neither a solid nor a liquid, it’s like a gas with fingers, it’s something from another dimension.” A VFX house then digitally augmented it. Meanwhile the sound design, along with Colin Stetson’s ear-shattering score, “pushes into ultrasound and infrasound – it goes beyond the human auditory level,” says Stanley. “The score really does push into forbidden frequencies in the last third of the movie.” The result is a bizarre and entertaining experience that is attracting repeat viewings in US cinemas. “People are going back to see the movie, realising they can take edibles with them.”His aim was to convey Lovecraft’s sense of cosmic horror, which, Stanley says, is “to see the sheer insignificance of one’s place both in the universe, the infinite cosmos that surrounds us, and in deep time, the fact that we are just a split second surrounded by billions of years on either side of us, and our lives will truly be forgotten”. He laughs. It’s a funny film too, in its extremity. “Good!” he says when I tell him so. “Everything I do is pretty much a deadpan apocalyptic black comedy.” Such has been the film’s success, he is now writing a follow-up, an adaptation of Lovecraft’s The Dunwich Horror. His version will be about “backward Maga-era hillbillies who have interbred with ultra-dimensional demons from beyond space,” he says with a glint in his eye. “It’s very juicy.” Meanwhile, returning to Hollywood after two decades in the remote Pyrenees mountains, he’s “back into the mixing board of human experience,” he says. “I still feel as if I’m visiting this time period. I don’t exactly feel like I belong here. But I think I’m gonna get a decent third act.”For now, he has to get home to his cat, which is being looked after by some witches, naturally. His current Montségur home, on a river, is in an even stranger locale than the cabin on the crag, he says. “In recent summers, there was a coven of witches using the house. Which is not an experience I’d like to repeat. They did leave the downstairs in a bit of a mess.”Chaos, it seems, is never far away.Color Out of Space is in cinemas from Friday 28 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff3d43f6f8a2271d52aa21a45e21a611d1f04ad5/0_1500_2470_1481/master/2470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67776442cab0d347801a164c379faa9e","title":"the invisible man review elisabeth moss","story":"A reliably committed lead performance ignites a mostly enjoyable, often timely, take on the HG Wells story that falls apart in the final actWhile some would argue that the worst thing to have spawned from Marvel’s extended cinematic universe is an overreliance on the superhero genre in general, there’s been something arguably more damaging at play. The unprecedented commercial success of the interconnected, multi-branched nature of the MCEU caused other studios to crave similar long-term profits and so franchises suddenly grew exponentially, in every possible direction, whether they needed to or not. The most disastrous example of this came from Universal who saw the trend as a way of relaunching and combining their many monster movies as part of the newly coined Dark Universe. A logo was released along with a promotional image of cast members from films that hadn’t yet started production, an ambitious yet ultimately foolish gamble given that the first of these, 2017’s The Mummy, was then rejected by audiences and critics.The Dark Universe went dark and instead it became snarky shorthand for what happens when a studio puts too many eggs in one precariously constructed basket. But in what feels like the smartest franchise-reviver since Ryan Coogler’s Creed, at least on paper, Blumhouse and Saw creator Leigh Whannell have transformed The Invisible Man from an expensive, Johnny Depp-starring adventure into a $7m R-rated horror with a female focus. It’s an ingenious way to utilise a widely known character while keeping risk at a minimum (the film will make its budget back and then some in its opening weekend alone) and also to give an old property a fresh feel, showcased quite perfectly in arguably the most effective trailer for the last six months.For the first 15 minutes, you’d be forgiven for thinking you’re watching a remake of Sleeping with the Enemy (something that’s in the works because of course) as Cecilia (Moss) enacts a daring escape from the ultra-modern house she shares with her controlling and abusive husband Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). She makes it out, just, and hides herself away with cop friend James (Clemency’s underrated Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia fears for her safety but when she finds out Adrian has killed himself, she fears something far worse: that he’s not dead and has found a way to make himself invisible.Existing under the same Blumhouse banner that’s housed everything from Happy Death Day to Sinister to Truth or Dare, The Invisible Man is pitched as a classier alternative, shot and structured more like a glossy early 90s thriller complete with a handsome San Francisco setting and a heavily stringed Hitchcockian score. It’s the familiar tale of a hero trying to convince those around that something dastardly yet unexplainable is afoot and while formulaic, there’s a timeliness to its portrait of an abused woman fighting for the right to be believed. Gaslighting has been a practice in film since well, 1940’s Gaslight, but it’s a word that’s only become more commonly used in the wider world in the last three years, following on from a compulsive gaslight-er moving into the White House. Whannell’s reinvention of HG Wells’s text uses this heightened awareness of how toxic men try to control and emotionally manipulate women in a similar, if less effective, way to Ari Aster’s Midsommar did last year. While Whannell wants to say something, what he actually has to say doesn’t amount to all that much. There’s a potentially potent metaphor here for the invisible man representing the shadow of an abusive relationship clinging to the abuser even after it’s finished but human psychology quickly takes a backseat to funhouse scares, with mixed results.There are some successfully creepy sequences as Cecilia starts to realise what she’s up against but given the conceit, there’s not nearly enough inventiveness on display. Bar a handful of sneaky, crowd-pleasing effects, the film’s in need of some craftier suspense set pieces with Whannell pulling back at times when he should be pushing further. It doesn’t help that despite Adrian’s hi-tech job in “optics”, those around Cecilia jump straight to assuming she’s lost her mind despite no reference to any prior mental illness, and so the by-the-numbers back-and-forth (something scary happens, she tells people, they don’t believe her, etc) gets tiring fast. It’s kept alive though by an on-form Moss, in her first studio lead, something of a trauma professional at this stage of her career after three seasons of The Handmaid’s Tale as well as punishing roles in last year’s big and small dramas The Kitchen and Her Smell.While I do crave the opportunity to see her in more films that don’t require quite so much sexual, physical and emotional abuse, she’s compelling as ever here, slickly transferring her skills to a far broader canvas, pushing herself through yet another gruelling obstacle course with gusto. It’s a fiery performance but even she struggles with an uneven final act that goes deep into genre excess with some outsized, and nonsensical, action as well as some ropey effects and a glaring plot-hole that’s left clumsily unresolved. Worst of all, Moss is denied the truly satisfying payoff she deserves. Like much of the film, the final scene opts for shock value over something more drawn out and it ends with a whimper rather than a roar.There’s fun to be had here, thanks to Moss and an involving set-up, and given the state of multiplex horror, especially at this time of year, this is a striking ersion. But Whannell gives us just enough to make us want more and despite the stretched 125-minute runtime, he can’t quite deliver what he loosely promises. This Invisible Man needed a bit more flesh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa02c0b218648f87e3ea686a26c65c72a155c656/384_42_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f83e658e591b9c08b0f6676e7e251995","title":"the numbers are incredible says klopp after record equalling west ham win","story":"Jürgen Klopp hailed Liverpool’s record-breaking campaign as “special” and “incredible” after the unbeaten Premier League leaders took another step towards the title with a 3-2 comeback victory over West Ham.Liverpool restored their lead at the summit to a remarkable 22 points courtesy of Sadio Mané’s late winner and despite trailing to Pablo Fornals’ second-half goal for David Moyes’ struggling side. It was a 21st consecutive home league win for Liverpool –equalling the all-time English record set by their predecessors in 1972 and setting a new Premier League record – and an 18th successive league win that equalled the top-flight record set by Manchester City.Klopp’s team have now won as many points – 79 – as Manchester United’s treble-winning team did in 1998-99 and as many league games – 26 – as Arsenal’s “Invincibles” in 2003-04.A proud Liverpool manager said: “A couple of years ago I said we wanted to write our own stories and create our own history and obviously the boys took what I said really seriously.“It is so special. The numbers are incredible. We all know that it is very special, but at this moment we just want to recover and prepare for the next opponent because they are really waiting and want to fight us.West Ham remain in the relegation zone after seven league games without a win under David Moyes, although their new manager was rightly encouraged by his team’s display at Anfield.Moyes said: “I felt we had grown into the game and started to earn the right to play. We thought there were points there for us. There is a lot I want to improve. I thought in the main we did well but this wasn’t a big game for us. Neither was Man City. These were warm-ups.

Meanwhile, hardware-accelerated raytracing allows for the kind of advanced and highly detailed lighting and shadow effects usually seen in animated movies.The Wire post goes on to mention the inclusion of an SSD drive, and another new feature, Dynamic Latency Input, which promises to make the Xbox wireless controller more responsive.The recently leaked specifications for both the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 seem to reveal very similar machines, both using AMD Zen 2 and RDNA technologies and SSD drives – but while the Xbox machine promises 12 teraflops of GPU, the leak suggests PS5 will be operating at 12.6 teraflops. However, the unverified specs suggest that Xbox Series X will have a slightly faster CPU (3.7Ghz as opposed to 3.6Ghz) and a larger capacity SSD (1TB versus PS5’s 500GB), but these granular details have not been confirmed.With a vague launch date set at “Holidays 2020”, it is likely several more waves of information will be released over the coming months. As Spencer states, “I’m proud to be able to share details about some of the technologies we are enabling for the next generation, and look forward to boldly sharing more as we head towards E3.”Sony is likely to be planning its own marketing onslaught in the meantime, and unlike Microsoft will not be attending the E3 games conference this year. Although there is little to separate the two machines in terms of architecture, it seems Sony’s designers may be looking for unique ways to differentiate PS5 – a recent rumour suggested that the next Dualshock controller could feature biofeedback sensors, allowing game developers to alter the game content depending on the emotional state of the player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ec7cc543fa803cde416b586ac039cf9eead6a4/0_57_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=754ec7244d9f5063ed8030bd5cf53d6f","title":"manchester city following the money","story":"Manchester City’s fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi.

I think that’s the one thing that I’ve got. I’ve had the respect and the support of all of the parliamentary Labour party and up and down the country most of the constituency Labour parties have supported me in this process. I resonate with people in the country in a way that Jeremy doesn’t.”She said Corbyn was not weak on security but he had “a more international view of things, whereas I’m more pragmatic”.“I understand the international context but I also understand most people in this country just want to know that you’re going to keep people safe and look after them and that’s my primary aim … and a lot of people didn’t think that’s what Jeremy’s primary aim was.”Her comments are some of the strongest criticism of Corbyn from any candidate in the leadership and deputy leadership races, where contenders have generally been careful to say they would not veer too far from his legacy.Elsewhere in ITV’s Acting Prime Minister interview with Paul Brand, Rayner spoke alongside her mother, Angela Bowen, about her difficult family life while growing up.The Ashton-under-Lyne MP talked about her mother battling with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, finding herself impoverished and struggling to feed her children.Bowen said of her daughter: “I was in a very dark place. She used to bath me, look after me, feed me.“If it wasn’t for her I don’t think I’d be here today.”She says Rayner “went through everything” as a child and her behaviour was “brilliant”.“All what she’s been through and everything, she’s come through it all and I’ve got to look at it that she’s had to go through this, down this road ... she’s gone through everything, got me in a stable way or else I wouldn’t be sitting here today, and look at her, look where she is,” she said.Rayner said it was “nice that my mum is proud of me, because I’m proud of her”.She added: “I remember being scared, remember staying at the bottom of my mum’s bed once, thinking is my mum going to do something, and not wanting to go to sleep because I didn’t want to go to sleep and think my mum wouldn’t be there in the morning, and that was quite traumatic.”Bowen said her daughter “had it rough” and she sometimes gets “upset with the way that Angie had to grow up pretty fast”.“I always picture her as the mum when I was having that really dark time because I was acting like a baby, because that’s all I could do,” she added.Asked what she made of Rayner’s bid to be Labour leader, Bowen said: “Watch this space, my daughter will be running this country in a few years’ time.“She can do it – she could do it now if she wanted ... watch this space. No one else can do the job but my daughter. I am so proud of her, I really am.“She’ll be the prime minister soon. Watch out, Boris, you won’t be there for long.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2e24f047ddbaf19e632007254f2f526f18e5ff/0_1_1705_1023/master/1705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f05483f96f33972d81be5c590ab9983a","title":"priti patels ineptitude is exactly what boris admires in her","story":"Patel being Priti Vacant is the main reason why Johnson made her home secretaryIt’s not always a great look for a prime minister to have to publicly restate his confidence in his home secretary just a matter of days after reappointing her to the job. A bit like a football club chairman offering his full support to the manager just days before sacking him. But for once in his life Boris Johnson has been entirely genuine. Hard to believe, I know, from someone for whom dishonesty is a way of life, but true nonetheless.Boris really, really does value Priti Patel. He doesn’t care if she bullies her staff a bit. He cares even less if intelligence officials don’t entirely trust her on matters of national security. Because that’s not the point of her. Just as the home secretary can never be too Brexity or dog-whistle rightwing, she can also never be too stupid or incompetent. These are the qualities Boris most admires, having gone to some trouble to eliminate every cabinet minister who showed the slightest sign of having any independence of thought. Or even of having a mind at all. Priti Patel’s sole purpose in government is to be Priti Vacant.In her statement to the Commons on her new points-based immigration system, Patel was at pains to live down to expectations. If there were a points-based tally for a home secretary, then it’s a racing certainty Priti would never have got the job. After all, this is the woman who responded to a terrorist incident by declaring war on counter-terrorism. On three occasions. She has turned her lack of ability into a piece of performance art.What she does have, though, is the effortless self-confidence of someone who doesn’t have a clue just how dim she is. She makes no effort to disguise her ignorance. Rather, she revels in it. And as she ran through the proposals the government had announced during recess the previous week, her smirk and swagger became steadily more pronounced. The country was wanting this, the country was loving this and the country was getting it.For reasons that weren’t entirely clear, Diane Abbott chose to sit this one out on the Labour frontbench and let her junior shadow home office minister, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, point out some of the new systems’ more obvious flaws. That it failed to distinguish between low-paid and low-skilled work. That it would leave huge staff shortages in many sectors. That it presumed the reason most Brits weren’t already doing these jobs was because immigrants had stolen them off them. Rather than that they just didn’t fancy doing them.Patel sighed ostentatiously and insisted that Ribeiro-Addy was just too stupid to have understood the proposals properly. Pots and kettles. At which point, Jeremy Corbyn intervened to say things might work a little better if the home secretary was a little less condescending. Priti merely replied that she too required courtesy and patience. Again, pots and kettles. The irony meter was now off the scale. Not even her friends have known her to be patient and courteous.Most ministers might have a sneaking suspicion they are heading off the rails, when the first four Conservative MPs to stand up to praise their intelligence and attention to detail are the notorious screw-balls Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, Owen Paterson and John Redwood. But Priti was in her element. Her coup de grace was her insistence that the British people had voted for massive staff shortages in the NHS and social care. And if people were determined to die or grow old in squalor then she was proud to be delivering on the will of the people. Back in No 10, Boris could only applaud. This was the Priti he knew and loved so much.Exit one brainless cabinet minister. Enter another. The environment secretary, George Eustice – Useless Eustice to his admirers – was at the despatch box to explain why the government had done so little about the floods. Eustice’s main observations were that it had rained much more than expected and that really most people had no one to blame but themselves for buying homes that had been built on vulnerable flood plains.Labour’s Luke Pollard expressed his pity for Eustice – it wasn’t his fault that he wasn’t very good at his job – and wondered instead why the prime minister had gone missing in action and had chosen to put his feet up at the nation’s expense in the grace-and-favour mansion in Kent. Useless was outraged on his master’s behalf. Boris had never pretended to be anything other than a bit lazy and it was going to take a great deal more than a few damps patches to get him out of bed.“Look,” said Eustice, trying to convince himself as much as everyone else. Boris had been to visit some flood victims in November and if he were to make another visit it would only encourage more people to flood their homes. Besides, the prime minister wasn’t the sort of showman who thrived on attention and media opportunities: he was the master of dialectics. The details man who got things done precisely by failing to grasp the details. Not waving but drowning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/054b849c8da2d9076894c1781bf2b761c1894ec9/0_201_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=637e7352b04606e9a4aa3e4c08491f0d","title":"keep chlorinated chicken ban to win trade deal eu tells uk","story":"Exclusive: clause in negotiating mandate for Michel Barnier will create hurdle to US-UK dealThe EU will demand the UK maintains a ban on chlorinated chicken as the price for a trade agreement with Brussels, in a move that protects European meat exports and creates an obstacle to a deal with Donald Trump.On the recommendation of France, a clause has been inserted into the EU’s negotiating mandate to insist that both sides maintain “health and product sanitary quality in the food and agriculture sector”, according to a copy leaked to the .The paragraph, in a newly entitled section of the document for the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, called “Environment and health” provides a catch-all insurance for the EU that certain methods of food production – particular pesticides, endocrine disrupters or chlorine washes for poultry – will not be used in the UK.At the weekend, George Eustice, the new UK environment secretary, refused to  guarantee that the government would not allow the importation of chlorine-washed chicken as part of a trade deal with the US.Eustice’s stance has caused concern in the UK where the National Farmers’ Union called for other countries to trade with Britain “on our terms”. The EU also fears that current suppliers of meat to the UK could be undercut by US imports.It is understood that France’s proposal to change the negotiating mandate had full backing from other member states.It was agreed last Friday while other “level playing field” provisions only received unanimous support on Monday from EU ambassadors.EU ministers will sign off on the 46-page negotiating mandate for Barnier on Tuesday before the start of talks next week.More generally, a debate had been ongoing between the French government, which wanted to tie the UK completely to the developing EU rulebook on environmental, social and workers’ standards, and other member states who believed it would be a demand too far.Following agreement by ambassadors, the EU will now demand the right to punish Britain if the government fails to shadow the Brussels rulebook in the future but they will not insist on “dynamic alignment” across the board.The compromise involves Brussels retaining the right to apply tariffs or other sanctions if any ergence between the two sides over time led to “disruptions of the equal condition of competition”, with EU law being the “reference point”.“It is about equality of outcomes,” one senior EU source said.The leaked agreement, obtained by the , states “the envisaged agreement should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with union standards as a reference point”.The EU also wants to establish a “governing body” to oversee a deal that “should be empowered to modify the level playing field commitments in order to include additional areas or to lay down higher standards over time”.France was alone in holding out for guarantees to go beyond mere “non-regression” from the current shared regulations.The bloc will also demand that the British government apply EU state aid rules in their entirety as they evolve – the one instance where Brussels is demanding complete alignment over time. The rules limit subsidies that can be given to industry.Barnier has admitted that such a policy is a “red rag” to the UK.The hardening of the EU position came as Boris Johnson was warned that the French government would not be “blackmailed” into a trade deal that risked its long-term economic interests.The prime minister’s decision to rule out an extension of the transition period after 31 December 2020 has put pressure on both parties to work swiftly on a deal or face huge extra costs on trade when the UK leaves the single market and customs union.But, speaking before a meeting of EU ministers, France’s EU affairs minister, Amélie de Montchalin, used a TV interview to say her country would not “sacrifice” the future of French industry, farming and fisheries to secure a swift deal.“Just because Boris Johnson wants an agreement at all costs on 1231 does not mean that we will sign a bad agreement for the French under the pressure of blackmail or time pressure,” De Montchalin later tweeted.Johnson has said he will not take up the option of extending the transition period for “up to one or two years”, as envisaged in the withdrawal agreement. He has said he will accept tariffs and quotas on goods if a deal is not agreed in time.The UK is likely to publish its plans on Thursday after the EU’s adoption of its negotiating mandate for the European commission.The government has so far rejected any deal that involves alignment on policy or Britain remaining under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, saying that a Canada-style trade deal, with looser provisions on ensuring a competitive level playing field, is the most appropriate option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f7621a5d86903106a9ad3e2436abdb313be9fcd/0_223_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53eb6af9b9062a2d878326df5da124af","title":"austerity blamed for life expectancy stalling for first time in century","story":"Landmark England review says policy causing unprecedented damage to health and life chancesLife expectancy has stalled for the first time in more than 100 years and even reversed for the most deprived women in society, according to a landmark review which shows the gap in health inequalities is yawning even wider than it did a decade ago, in large part due to the impact of cuts linked to the government’s austerity policies.Sir Michael Marmot’s review, 10 years after he warned that growing inequalities in society would lead to worse health, reveals a shocking picture across England, which he says is no different to the rest of the UK and could have been prevented.The government has not taken the opportunity to improve people’s lives and life chances over the last 10 years, the report says. Real cuts to people’s incomes are damaging the nation’s health for the long term. Not only are lifes stalling, but people are living for more years in poor health.“This damage to the nation’s health need not have happened. It is shocking,” said Marmot, who is the director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity.“The UK has been seen as a world leader in identifying and addressing health inequalities but something dramatic is happening. This report is concerned with England, but in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the damage to health and wellbeing is similarly unprecedented.“Austerity has taken a significant toll on equity and health, and it is likely to continue to do so. If you ask me if that is the reason for the worsening health picture, I’d say it is highly likely that is responsible for the life expectancy flat-lining, people’s health deteriorating and the widening of health inequalities.“Poverty has a grip on our nation’s health – it limits the options families have available to live a healthy life. Government health policies that focus on inidual behaviours are not effective. Something has gone badly wrong.”The report shows that health has worsened in many of the “red wall” constituencies that backed Brexit and returned Boris Johnson’s government to power by voting Conservative for the first time. Voters in the new Tory-held seats can expect to live for 60.9 years in good health life, fewer than in both the long-held Tory seats (65 years) and the Labour seats (61.4 years).Boris Johnson’s government has promised to “level up” those areas. To do that, says review, they will need to take immediate action to stop the deterioration in health.Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation, which commissioned the review, said this levelling up “will require the government to go further than investment in infrastructure – building bridges, train lines and new hospitals. It must also invest in the circumstances in which people live that have powerful impacts on their health and wellbeing, such as poverty, employment, housing and education. The evidence is clear and the solutions are there – what is needed is the will to act.”Marmot says the worsening of our health cannot be written off as the fault of iniduals for living unhealthy lives. Their straitened circumstances and poor life chances are to blame. His institute’s work has established that healthy lives depend on early child development, education, employment and working conditions, an adequate income, and a healthy and sustainable community in which to live and work.Austerity has taken its toll over the last 10 years in all of these areas, says Marmot in a foreword to the report. “From rising child poverty and the closure of children’s centres, to declines in education funding, an increase in precarious work and zero hours contracts, to a housing affordability crisis and a rise in homelessness, to people with insufficient money to lead a healthy life and resorting to food banks in large numbers, to ignored communities with poor conditions and little reason for hope … Austerity will cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.”He dismisses the argument made by government in the past that stalling life expectancy was about more severe winters or flu. It impacts the poorest more than the most affluent. It is also more marked in the UK than it is in most high-income countries, except for the US.“If you go back 100 years, from the end of the 19th century, life expectancy just kept increasing by about one year every four years,” Marmot told the . The dramatic change in the curve began around 2010, he said. “It’s not due to a winter effect, because the slowdown was seven-eighths as big in the non-winter quarters.”“You talk to local authority after local authority around the country, and they say, ‘We can’t do any more.’ We are closing youth centres, we’re closing Sure Start children’s centres and we are closing libraries, and parks and recreation centres. We can scarcely do what we have to do to fulfil our statutory duty,” said Marmot.The president of the Royal College of Physicians, Prof Andrew Goddard, said the review painted “a stark picture”, adding: “We agree with Sir Michael that there is a need for a national strategy to tackle health inequalities, as the solutions needed cut across many government departments including education, business and housing. This is a wake-up call for the government to act quickly and strategically to improve the health of people in deprived areas.”Councillor Ian Hudspeth, the chairman of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, also called the report a wake-up call: “Councils want to work with government on closing this gap by focusing on the social causes of ill-health, such as early years development, education and employment opportunities and improving services for older people. Sustainable, long-term investment in councils’ public health services is also needed.” Imran Hussain of Action for Children said the report “delivers a devastating judgment on a decade of crippling cuts to lifeline services like Sure Start and benefits for families fighting to keep their heads above water.The government claimed it was working to reduce health inequalities. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “I thank Professor Sir Michael Marmot for his dedicated work to shine a light on this vital issue. His findings show just how important this agenda is, and renew my determination to level up health life expectancy across our country. After all, levelling up health is the most important levelling up of all.“There is still much more to do, and our bold prevention agenda, record £33.9bn a year investment in the NHS, and world-leading plans to improve children’s health will help ensure every person can lead a long and healthy life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c894b03cf746138be37e5893bf7d22f7f2e6a14/0_171_5122_3074/master/5122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66e812f6851ea11c16990d6e9a25b76d","title":"england predicted to miss target of becoming smoke free by 2030","story":"Call for more government action as figures show smoking much higher among poorThe government is expected to miss its targetof England being smoke-free by 2030 because so many poorer people are still using cigarettes, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) has warned.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, set that ambition in last year’s green paper on health prevention which spelled out his determination to “finish the job” of eradicating smoking, including an ultimatum for industry to make smoked tobacco obsolete by 2030.However, persistently high rates of smoking in more deprived areas means that on current trends England will not be smoke-free until 2037, seven years later than hoped, CRUK said in a report on Tuesday.Smoking remains the biggest cause of preventable ill-health, such as cancer, heart attacks and stroke, killing about 115,000 people a year. It is estimated to cost the UK £11bn a year, of which £2bn is spent by the NHS.Dr Katrina Brown, the charity’s statistics manager and co-author of the report, said: “Our modelling suggests that if the 2020 target is achieved, there could be 3.4 million fewer smokers in England compared to today.“But unless government acts to make smoking rates fall faster, we’re unlikely to reach the target,” she added.The charity wants ministers to try to deliver the 2030 pledge by putting more money into public information campaigns to discourage smoking and stop smoking services. Both have been cut in recent years as a result of Whitehall reducing the amount of public health funding it gives local councils.It is also urging ministers to impose a levy on tobacco firms to help pay for those measures. That would yield about £265.5m in England and £315.2m across the UK, “easily affordable” sums for an industry that makes £1.5bn a year profit, CRUK says.Toby Green, the policy and research manager at the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “Reaching the smoke-free ambition by 2037 instead of the 2030 target may not sound like a disaster. But as this new analysis shows, the reality of this is 2 million more smokers in England a decade from now, unless we scale up our efforts.”The Taskforce for Lung Health estimated recently that, although 1.5 million people in England quit smoking through stop smoking services between 2011 and 2019, another 904,430 would have done so if more support had been available.CRUK’s analysis also found that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will not be smoke-free until after 2050, 2037 and the late 2040s respectively.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Smoking rates are at their lowest since records began and robust government action, including plain packaging and awareness campaigns, are driving us towards our ambition to be a smoke-free society by 2030.“We are a global leader in tobacco control and prevention remains at the heart of our NHS long-term plan. We are supporting local authorities with £3bn funding this financial year to spend on public health services, including stop-smoking services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/438c2cd539a30e77dfffeeb2b3bd67b21b6700e8/441_557_4409_2645/master/4409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1e0a6f9ecc45707c402a1fb2d7a9b5","title":"englands six nations hopes spread of coronavirus in italy","story":"The Rugby Football Union is in talks with Six Nations organisers amid concerns England’s push for the title could be affected – and the remainder of the competition thrown into chaos – by the spread of the coronavirus in Italy.England are due to face Italy in Rome on 14 March on the final day of the Six Nations but there are already doubts over Italy’s match against Ireland in Dublin a week earlier. The Irish health minister said on Monday that the fixture needs “considerable consideration”.The Italian rugby federation has also postponed all matches, from elite to grassroots level, this weekend and suspended all gatherings of its national teams in the affected regions.Postponed matches would mean the Six Nations is forced into at least one extra week, or fixtures could have to be played considerably later. That could wreak havoc, with France, England and Ireland still harbouring hopes of winning the title. In 2001 one match was played in September and two in October owing to the disruption caused by the spread of foot and mouth disease.Ireland’s minister for health, Simon Harris, said: “The rugby game is something that needs considerable consideration. This situation is evolving. The weekend’s activities have shown there is still an awful lot unknown about the coronavirus and about the path it might take. There will be some big decisions in the coming days. Most particularly, I’m thinking of the Ireland-Italy game.”Two Pro14 matches – Ospreys’ match against Zebre in Parma and Ulster’s trip to Treviso to play Benetton – have been called off. “To ensure the safety of our players and spectators Pro14 Rugby fully supports the preventative measures taken in Italy,” read a statement.On Sunday, all sporting events in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto were postponed, including the women’s Six Nations match between Italy and Scotland. Several towns in the areas are under lockdown. While England’s men’s side face Italy in Rome next month, both the women’s and under-20 matches are scheduled for those affected regions.Mauro Vegni, the head of the race organisation for several top Italian cycling events including the Giro d’Italia, which is scheduled to start on 9 May in Budapest, said he was concerned the virus could affect the Milan‑San Remo race next month. “Like everyone, we are concerned by what’s happening,” he told Cycling News.“At the same time we hope that, with time, the situation will improve and that the number of cases will not increase. Milan-San Remo is the one that worries me the most,” he added. At the moment there’s no plan B for Milan‑San Remo. It would make no sense to cut three quarters of the race. We can only follow the lead from the government. We still have three weeks until Milan‑San Remo.”South Korea’s K-league has postponed the start of its football season, which had been due to kick off this weekend. “The K-league has decided to temporarily postpone the start of the 2020 K-league season until the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak eases,” it said in a statement.Matches featuring Daegu FC, based in the city at that is the epicentre of the South Korea outbreak, and nearby Pohang Steelers, had already been postponed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38d2ef56f6f3018921d862e3fc26695b6b8cb27/0_64_3496_2098/master/3496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd62f8b5639ed4ed2e096c83a03c445c","title":"irelands backline were spooked by englands effort and attitude","story":"Home side consistently doubled up on Ireland’s attackers and when it comes to executing a territorial game Eddie Jones’s side are the best in the worldThere was plenty to admire in England’s performance against Ireland but the most impressive aspect was that they looked back to their destructive and dominant best in defence. Manu Tuilagi gives them such a launchpad in attack and he gets them over the gain-line, but it was a victory based on their outstanding effort in defence.First, their decision-making at the breakdown was excellent. Very rarely were they competing at the wrong times and as a result they always seemed to have numbers on their feet.On top of that was their ability to “Double D” on Ireland’s attackers outside Johnny Sexton. What I mean by that is England’s defenders – let’s take Maro Itoje as an example because I thought he was exceptional – were defending the frontline but also the Ireland players sweeping out the back. If you can get to that second line of attack it allows the wider defenders to shut down the attacking options.We call it “spooking” the inside attackers and it forces them to play short which then in turn means your defenders in the middle of the pitch can double up with two-man tackles. England did that time and again, and when you can do it repeatedly you can march the opposition back.Most man-watching defences operate the “Double D” principle and England are no different with John Mitchell calling the shots. If you come up against an attack which uses layers, as most now do as a way of combating line speed, playing out the back behind lead runners is a common attacking system in the modern game. The key for the defensive side is to check the lead runners and then push off to put pressure on the next layer. Itoje was at the forefront but not alone, and the rest of those defenders in the middle, particularly when Ireland were coming off an edge, had an ability to make the right read, still bring that effective linespeed and push through again. Ireland started to play short and England could pick them off with two-man hits which always tend to be dominant.It’s very tough to play against but you can either try to turn the defenders by kicking in behind or by putting them on the ground at the ruck. England were able to fight away from Ireland’s ruck-clearers and ensure they were not getting caught as much as their opposite numbers. That’s automatically a win for the defensive side, so if you are playing England you have to try to tie as many men into the ruck as you can, try to play in and around there and shorten up their defensive line as much as possible. When England bring the kind of effort and attitude they did on Sunday, though, it is a very difficult task.Ireland were forced into all manner of mistakes and they really struggled to get out of their half. There was a lack of creativity from Ireland it always tends to be the case when your half-backs don’t have great games and that was the most erratic I’ve seen Sexton for a long time. That seemed to have knock-on effect on Conor Murray, which in turn made their shape too predictable.England did not have such problems with getting their attack going. I wouldn’t say they were quite at their World Cup sharpness but I do believe that when it comes to executing a territorial game England are the best in the world. And with Ben Youngs and then Willi Heinz, George Ford, Owen Farrell and Elliot Daly forming the spine of the back line they are always likely to be.We saw them able to identify space in behind against Scotland and against Ireland they did the same. There was an element of luck to their tries in the first half but kicks like that create panic that England were able to take advantage of. When they are on song like that they can be very hard to play against. Ford can pivot from right to left in a split second, or he can move the ball to 12 which brings wings up, Farrell can then do the same, or they can play to the edge and Daly can do it.Looking at where England are now in terms of their campaign I think a transition period after a result like that in the World Cup final was inevitable. The whole Saracens debacle cannot have helped and then you have changes to the coaching staff which will alter the dynamic of the group.But back on their home turf, in good conditions, we simply saw good players playing well. Courtney Lawes was deservedly the man of the match, stepping up without Mako or Billy Vunipola there. In terms of getting that next phase over the gainline, often after Tuilagi had made the first dent, he was excellent, making big hits as well.On the whole they looked more comfortable in their combinations.

And now the  has learned that the proposal has the support of the influential corporate governance groups ISS and Glass Lewis.Together these two firms advise the world’s largest institutional investors on how they vote at company’s annual meetings, so their backing for the proposal is a coup for SumOfUs.Ahead of Wednesday’s annual meeting, ISS and Glass Lewis have sent reports to their clients, seen by the , explaining why they should back the proposal.In their reports, both Glass Lewis and ISS highlighted various news reports of Apple making apps unavailable in China.In 2016, it emerged that Apple had removed its iBooks Store and iTunes Movies services from devices owned by Chinese customers. In 2017, it removed several virtual private network (VPN) apps, which were used by Chinese citizens to bypass state censorship apparatus. And last year the company removed HKMap.Live, a controversial crowdsourced mapping app that was being used by Hong Kong protesters to track police activity.The SumOfUs proposal would force Apple’s board to prepare an annual report on the company’s policies relating to freedom of expression and access to information. The board would be compelled to state in the report whether they are “publicly committed to freedom of expression and access to information”.They would also have to disclose a “description of the actions Apple has taken in the past year in response to government or third-party demands that were reasonably likely to limit free expression or access to information”.SumOfUs believes the need to clarify Apple’s relationship with China is made particularly urgent by public outrage surrounding Beijing’s treatment of Uighur people sent to internment camps and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.Despite backing from ISS and Glass Lewis, SumOfUs still faces an uphill battle to pass the motion because it is opposed by Apple’s board, which includes the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and former US vice-president Al Gore.Apple has issued a statement saying the proposal is “unnecessary based on the extensive information that is already publicly provided to our shareholders and users”.The company currently publishes transparency data disclosing the number of government requests it receives by country for customer data and app removal.For instance, Apple reported that between January and June last year, 288 apps were removed in mainland China for “legal” or “platform” violation. Apple stated that the majority of these requests related to pornography, “illegal content” and gambling.But in its report to investors, ISS noted that the “quantitative approach to the company’s transparency report provides little context for the app removal requests from the Chinese government or explanation of the risks that may be involved”.Apple said in its statement that free expression “is central to our company and its success” but that it is obliged to “comply with local laws and to protect the safety of our customers and employees”, including by removing apps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0fdea01e91b6ddfd4e4a76bdcb792417c4f3f21/0_0_2674_1605/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bcf3dabfee5e00a2293135692c57e92","title":"dancing cranes west sweden migrating wildlife spectacle lake hornborga","story":"Every spring Lake Hornborga hosts a vast, noisy gathering of the migrating birds, drawing spectators from across the worldThe throng stretches out on either side of me: a shifting, bickering thousands-strong multitude spread around the lakeside, jostling for space and filling the air with sound. It is a breathtaking sight, a cacophonous celebration of life on a spectacular scale.While rural south-west Sweden is the kind of place one might visit in order to avoid the crowds, it is the masses that I have come to witness: the vast congregation of cranes that gather every year on the banks of Lake Hornborga during their long migration to rest and feed.More than that, they dance.Lake Hornborga lies north-east of Gothenburg and on arrival I waste no time in heading to the waterside from my accommodation in the nearby town of Falköping. I notice a few of the birds dotted about the fields as I approach the site but you don’t have to be a birdwatcher to spot this large, long-legged species. Towering up to 1.3 metres, they certainly stand out, with their elongated necks, black and white head stripes, grey plumage and bustle of feathers at the rear.Nothing quite prepares you for the main event, though, and turning off the road to the trandansen (crane dance) arena I am faced with an expanse of wetland and grassland covered in common cranes 19,500 of them to be precise, according to the daily count carried out by volunteers.Amid the giant flock, courting pairs dance, reaffirming potentially lifelong bonds with leaps and bows and bugle-blasts of noise. Their exuberant jumps and jerky neck thrusts might have a touch of dad-dancing about them but they are such elegant birds that they carry off the moves in style.“It’s a wonderful sight,” says bird guide Kent-Ove Hvass as we gaze out from the viewing point at the animated assembly a few metres away, fanning out around the bay and flying in from all directions. “And the more you watch them over the years the more you see how unique they all are.”The annual arrival of cranes begins in mid-March and has a special place in the hearts of Swedes as a sign of spring and longer days ahead – and it draws spectators from across the country and beyond. While it may well have occurred in this area for thousands of years, the birds have also been encouraged to visit because of the local production of brännvin: Swedish vodka.At one time potatoes were grown locally to create the spirit and migrating cranes gradually developed an appetite for unharvested tubers left in the ground. Their seasonal visits became such a popular sight that when the district distilleries shut down in the 1970s, the birds continued to be fed – which also helped prevent hungry flocks from raiding crops in neighbouring farmers’ fields.Today up to 150 tonnes of grain are spread beside Lake Hornborga during spring, helping the birds to refuel as they journey to breeding grounds in the far north. Their journey starts in Spain but many fly in from Rügen, northern Germany, another staging post, 430km away or a one-day flight. The greatest numbers tend to be seen in late Marchearly April, and when I visited last year a new record was set as the daily tally peaked at 27,300 cranes. By May they have departed on the final leg of their journeys but the lake is still a great place to see other waterfowl and raptors, such as marsh harrier, osprey, golden and white-tailed eagle.“Seeing the crane dance is on the bucket list for a lot of Swedes,” says Sofie Stålhand, Hornborga reserve centre manager. “And hopefully the experience inspires people to learn more about our nature and why it is worth protecting.”The area celebrates the influx of cranes with a week-long festival, and has other features of interest besides birdlife, including ancient standing stones at Ekornavallen and the fascinating Kata Gård Viking tombs unearthed on a hillside overlooking Varnhem Abbey. A museum and newly built centre at Varnhem tell the story of the excavation of one of Sweden’s oldest churches and life in the community down the centuries.There are a range of places to enjoy local food near Lake Hornborga, including historic hillside hotel and spa Kurorten Mössebergs (buffet lunch from £12, doubles from £140 B\u0026ampB) Löfwings Ateljé \u0026amp Krog (mains from £13, doubles from £107 B\u0026ampB), where you can browse wildlife art in an adjoining gallery Vilhelmsro Gårdscafe (doubles from £91 B\u0026ampB), a converted 19th-century dairy farm serving organic fare and Herrtorps Qvarn (doubles from £54 room only locally sourced, organic meals), a renovated riverside mill offering the opportunity to spot beavers in the wild. The giant cheese emporium Falbygdens Osteria, with 200 varieties to choose from, is also a flavoursome visit.During their five-week stay the cranes steal the show. Gawky and raucous at one moment, stately and serene the next, they are mesmerising to watch. Some people camp out near the site so they can savour the precious spectacle until the sun goes down, the birds head off to roost for the night, and the last dancer leaves the floor.• Read more about the cranes and the local area Flamingos in FranceThe vast Camargue wetland in southern France plays host to thousands of pairs of greater flamingos that nest among its briny lagoons every spring and summer, with guided tours available or the chance of close views at the bird park Pont de Gau.Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth (30 miles east of Edinburgh, off North Berwick coast) has the world’s largest gannet colony during spring and summer, when 150,000 of these large seabirds nest on the island’s cliffs.

Even though Fidel Castro did it?”The Florida Democrats Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell were among those to criticize Sanders’s muted praise for the deceased Cuban president.“I’m hoping that in the future Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro,” Shalala tweeted.“The Castro regime murdered and jailed dissidents, and caused unspeakable harm to too many South Florida families,” Mucarsel-Powell wrote. “To this day, it remains an authoritarian regime that oppresses its people, subverts the free press and stifles a free society.”Sanders’ comments are likely to feature in Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina.Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has spent more than $460m of his own money in an attempt to establish himself as the Democrat best placed to beat Donald Trump, indicated on Monday that he would also target Sanders on gun control.The Bloomberg campaign released a video attacking the senator for his mixed record on the subject.Before Sanders was elected to Congress in 1990, for example, he received support from the National Rifle Association because his Republican opponent had supported banning assault weapons. The Bloomberg video also highlighted Sanders’ support for a law that helps stop mass shooting victims suing gun manufacturers and the five times he voted against a bill which called for waiting periods before acquiring guns and instant background checks on gun purchases.Sanders addressed the issue in the New Hampshire debate earlier this month.“Until the last – two years ago – we had virtually no gun control legislation at all, and I represented that perspective,” he said. “The world has changed, and my views have changed.“And my view is right now, we need universal background checks. We end the gun show loophole. We end the so-called strawman provision. We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country.”Bloomberg has poured money into the gun control movement but it is unclear if his cash can overcome the damage wrought by other candidates’ focus on his own record regarding women and people of color.At the last debate, in Nevada, the former mayor failed to craft a convincing response to criticism of his controversial policing policy, stop-and-frisk, which disproportionately impacted minorities.The favored centrist candidate in South Carolina is Joe Biden, who remains popular with African American voters, a dominant presence in Democratic contests in the state, after serving for eight years as vice-president to Barack Obama.Biden, who has denied suggestions that that his campaign will be over if he does not win South Carolina, is expected to receive a well-timed endorsement from the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress.“We are going to let people know how we feel about these candidates, and it may not line up with Nevada or New Hampshire or Iowa,” Clyburn told ABC News on Sunday.As Trump tweeted gleefully about supposed establishment attempts to block Sanders, some Democrats called on candidates including the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg to exit the race in order to consolidate the moderate vote.All the remaining candidates, however, have said they plan to stick around for Super Tuesday.Buttigieg, who like Sanders declared himself the winner of the muddled Iowa caucuses, used his concession speech in Nevada to warn against a “rush” to nominate Sanders to face Trump in November.The senator, he said, is a “disaster in waiting”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3ddd089477868219b53bbb86f6aa2bd475b256c/0_231_3728_2238/master/3728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dcb13b5ef01d8e1c4123aeaec7045a6","title":"harvey weinstein los angeles trial","story":"LA case, announced before Manhattan trial began, focuses on charges for two alleged attacks over two daysThe verdict in the New York case against Harvey Weinstein is only the beginning of the movie mogul’s prosecution, with separate charges against the disgraced producer ahead in Los Angeles.In the most high-profile trial of the #MeToo movement yet, a New York jury on Monday found Weinstein guilty of third-degree rape for an attack in a New York hotel and guilty of a criminal sex act for forcing oral sex on a former television production assistant. The fallen titan of Hollywood, who was taken away in handcuffs, could face 25 years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender.Next, Weinstein is due to face a criminal case in LA, which stems from investigations by law enforcement in southern California into eight allegations.LA prosecutors have filed charges for two incidents that allegedly occurred within a two-day period. Those charges include forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint, carrying a potential 28-year prison sentence.It’s not yet clear how LA prosecutors plan to proceed following Monday’s verdict in New York. Weinstein could be immediately brought to California after his 11 March sentencing in New York. He could pursue a plea deal in LA after his guilty verdict in Manhattan, or he could end up facing a second trial, said Laurie Levenson, criminal law professor at Loyola Law School. Either way, it’s an uphill battle for the former movie producer, she said: “When he heads to LA, he’s already a convicted rapist.”The LA district attorney’s office declined to answer questions on Monday about the next steps in the case, but a spokesperson told the : “We are definitely proceeding.”In LA, Weinstein is accused of raping a woman at a hotel after pushing his way inside her room on 18 February 2013. Prosecutors said in court filings that Weinstein and the woman, who has not been publicly identified but has been described by her attorney as an Italian actor, had both attended a film festival that week. When Weinstein showed up at her hotel door, they “talked briefly” before the producer “attacked” her, according to the documents. He also faces allegations by Lauren Young, a 30-year-old model from Pennsylvania who has already provided an extensive account of her story as a witness in New York.Young told the jury in New York that a female acquaintance had invited her to the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills on 19 February 2013, and that she hoped to show Weinstein her film script.She said Weinstein asked the acquaintance and Young to go to his hotel room, where he led her into his suite and then the bathroom. Young alleged that the encounter became coercive and that as she entered the bathroom, the acquaintance closed the door behind her, leaving her with Weinstein. He allegedly turned the shower on and started undressing.“I stood there in shock. He was already naked at that point. He stepped in front of me when I went to approach the door with his naked body right in front of me. I felt so trapped,” she said.Young said Weinstein pushed her against the sink, unzipped and pulled down her dress, and groped her as he masturbated. She continued: “I said, ‘no, no, no’, the whole time … He’s carrying on with conversation: ‘This is what all actresses do, to make it.’”Despite her protests, Weinstein continued to masturbate until he ejaculated on to a towel, she said.Weinstein and his attorneys have continued to deny allegations of criminal offenses and have vowed to appeal the New York verdict.If women do testify in an LA trial, they will probably be subject to the same aggressive tactics that Weinstein’s defense team has deployed in New York. Donna Rotunno, Weinstein’s lead defense attorney, engaged in an intense character assassination of all six women who testified, accusing them of lying, having false memories and seeking money. She also repeatedly noted the women’s continued contact with Weinstein after the alleged attacks.Toward the end of the New York trial, Rotunno faced intense scrutiny for telling the New York Times she had never been sexually assaulted “because I would never put myself in that position”.Advocates for survivors of sexual violence and some of Weinstein’s accusers have slammed his lawyers’ strategies, arguing that the attorneys were perpetuating harmful tropes about sexual assault. Many have noted that it’s common for women to maintain relationships with perpetrators after the attacks.“The lawyers’ disgusting tactics to discredit and humiliate or try to humiliate the women and make it so that we are not believed, it’s awful,” the actor Rosanna Arquette, one of the first women to share details of Weinstein’s abuse in 2017, told the . “It exposes the difficulties women face when they come forward and tell the truth about their abusers.”Arquette, who rallied outside the New York courthouse at the start of the trial, said it seemed the brutal cross-examinations of the women were meant to intimidate others so they would not testify in LA or continue to speak out.“It is a scare tactic to shut women up, to stop further women from coming forward,” she said. “But we will always have the women’s backs … It’s not going to work.”Zoe Brock, a writer and designer from New Zealand who also spoke up about Weinstein in 2017, said the New York verdict signaled to Weinstein’s lawyers that they “can no longer victim-shame and blame and treat women on the stand as the guilty party and get away with it”, adding: “It proves you can be in a consensual relationship with someone and still be raped … that there is no perfect victim, that in the wake of trauma, we do complicated things.”Brock added that she was eager to see Weinstein face additional convictions in LA: “I hope every woman who suffered at the hands of Harvey Weinstein gets a rightful verdict, which is guilty, guilty guilty.”Wagatwe Wanjuki, an LA-based writer and anti-rape activist not involved in the case, said the trial and the treatment of women were another reminder that the criminal justice system was not well suited to address sexual violence and support survivors.“It really just highlights how hostile it is for victims. Weinstein doesn’t have to testify but the victims do, and they have to be blamed and detail really graphic details of really traumatic incidents,” she said. “This is why few rapists ever get arrested, very few are convicted, and even fewer go to jail … How do we move away from being dependent on a very traumatic process?”Arquette said that women would not stop speaking out, regardless of what happens: “We will continue to fight for truth and justice, and we are always going to be here supporting all women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a222b38392aaae27e77664b9ce8d8636d59b466/0_207_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f6483c5a2778f297732807be3e14ad","title":"how have your travel plans been affected by the coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from those who have cancelled or rearranged travel plans due to the outbreakItaly and Iran have been forced to introduce travel restrictions due to major outbreaks in both countries.

The king accepted his resignation but asked for him to stay on as interim leader. The country is now in limbo as rival parties rush to strike deals and form a government.Mahathir did not give a reason for his resignation. There were long-standing tensions within the ruling alliance, which involved an unlikely partnership between Mahathir and Anwar Ibrahim. The two politicians have a decades-long feud, but united ahead of the 2018 elections to oust the government of Najib Razak, which was entangled in the 1MDB graft saga - often referred to as the world’s biggest financial fraud. As part of the deal, Mahathir promised that he would hand his job over to Anwar. He has refused to set a date for doing so.Rivalries between the two politician’s factions came to a head on Sunday, when Mahathir’s supporters reportedly met with the opposition party implicated in the 1MDB scandal to discuss forming a new government.Anwar said on Monday that Mahathir had spoken to him and had been “very clear that in no way will he ever work with those associated with the past regime” and that he quit over allegations that he would partner with the previous regime.Not necessarily. Despite resigning from his position, analysts say Mahathir is now in a stronger position than he was in 2018. Parties on both sides, including his supporters who have quit the ruling alliance, still appear to support him. It’s not clear if he actually intends to stand down.Politicians now have a short window in which to form a government, and rival camps are rushing to strike deals. To form a government, a coalition must have a minimum of 112 out of the 222 members of parliament.Mahathir could form a government with parties who remain in the ruling coalition, backed up by new support from elsewhere. Or he could follow his traditional supporters who have abandoned the ruling alliance, and team up with those he removed from power in 2018.He could also step back from the turmoil, and make way for a race between Anwar and figures from his own party, Bersatu.If no side is able to gain enough numbers, the king may call for a snap election.Mahathir and Anwar once worked together in the same party, with Anwar serving as deputy prime minister and finance minister under Mahathir, when he was prime minister for 22 years. But the pair clashed over issues relating to the economy, and Anwar was sacked in 1998. He went on to lead protests against Mahathir, and was later jailed on charges of corruption and sodomy that many said were politically motivated and an attempt by Mahathir to remove Anwar as a potential threat.He has since been jailed twice on widely-criticised sodomy charges. But, when, in a surprising turnaround, Mahatir teamed up with Anwar before the 2018 election, he promised to release him from prison. In May 2018, Anwar walked free following a royal pardon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a5b2ae1206ff5650e700915aa2c89787ca25b1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d780cdf08d619549737cb34e0680c2","title":"canary islands sandstorm leaves tourists stranded in pictures","story":"A sandstorm forced the closure of airports on Spain’s Canary Islands at the weekend.

You could spend weeks here checking out the hip places to sip coffee and the alternative sights, such as the world’s first floating farm that opened in Merwehaven last summer. Also look out for free events across the city to coincide with Liberation Day on 5 May, which is a national holiday in the Netherlands. For extra points, extend your break into the following week when Rotterdam will be getting ready to host this year’s Eurovision song contest.Take four days of holiday before the early May bank holiday (8 May) to get nine days off in a row, including weekends.Roll those May bank holidays together … and take a summer road trip through IrelandGot some annual leave that needs using up? (Apparently those people do exist!) Then take 10 days between the two May bank holidays and you’ll get a sweet 18 days off in a row. That’s an excellent amount of time to do justice to a road trip around Ireland. P\u0026ampO Ferries’ Cairnryan to Larne route takes you from south-west Scotland to Northern Ireland in a speedy two hours. There are up to seven crossings a day, so you’ll have heaps of flexibility about when you travel.Arriving at Larne, which is just 20 miles from Belfast, you’re well placed to check out the new Game of Thrones tour at Linen Mill Studios (opening in spring). And don’t forget to include Galway in your itinerary – the west coast town is the European capital of culture for 2020. Events in May include a new artwork from David Best, who’s known for his blazing installations at Burning Man.Take 10 days of holiday between the two May bank holidays (8 and 25 May) to get a continuous 18 days off, including weekends.Make the most of the final long weekend of the summer … with a week discovering Dublin and its surroundingsPlan a holiday in the first week of September and you’ll only need to take four days of annual leave for a full week’s break, as it will include the last summer bank holiday of the year on 31 August. If you live in the Midlands or the north of England, make the most of P\u0026ampO Ferries’ service from Liverpool for a late summer trip to Dublin. The crossing time is eight and a half hours, there are up to six a day, and you can opt for a daytime or overnight journey. Meals are also included in the price of your ticket.Ireland is known for its festivals, and at the beginning of September, Dublin Fringe clicks into gear. The 16-day event takes over the streets with performances aimed at pushing boundaries and generally making you go: “Eh, what was that?” (but in a good way). The city is also an excellent base for day trips, especially if you’re in need of a nature fix before autumn arrives. The moody landscape of the Wicklow mountains will charm any hillwalker, while coastal towns such as Howth offer up clifftop views and seafood pub lunches.Take four days of holiday after the summer bank holiday (31 August) to get nine days off in a row, including weekends.Memorable holidays start with P\u0026ampO Ferries.

From France to Belgium,  Dixe Wills discovers five ‘no-fly’ camping holidays in Europe, all accessible by ferry Aaah, camping. A chance to slow down, unwind and gently ease back on the throttle of daily life. So it makes no sense to bookend the experience with stressful airports and conscience-troubling flights. Thankfully, there are plenty of great campsites that are easily accessible by ferry, a far more relaxed way of travelling that can become an enjoyable part of your holiday …Mini Camping de Hooiberg, the NetherlandsThe Dutch are inveterate campers and so it’s no surprise that so many campsites in the Netherlands are run by people who really get the whole “life under canvas” vibe. Set on an idyllic organic dairy farm, Mini Camping de Hooiberg is one such site. It’s not just any old dairy farm, either, but an organic one that produces its own unpasteurised cheeses. They’re for sale in the farm shop along with locally made bread, and fruit and vegetables from nearby farms. Open all year, the tree-lined campsite, which has just 25 pitches, has its own cafe, and is situated in Brabantse Kempen, a region of forests, heathland and meadows criss-crossed with walking, cycling and mountain biking routes. And if your idea of camping heaven means not being woken at the crack of dawn by yelping children, then you’re in luck – this site is for grownups only.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Rotterdam. Mini Camping de Hooiberg is a one-and-a-half hour drive from there.Camping Scheibeekhoeve, BelgiumBelgium isn’t a country that one automatically associates with camping, but this makes Camping Scheibeekhoeve an even more joyful find. Set on a farm, with the Scheibeek waterway running around it, the campsite offers some welcome peace, tranquility and fresh country air. There are excellent facilities for those with disabilities, while children can burn off some energy in the play barn or on pedal-powered go-karts. The campsite is situated in rural Sint-Rijkersstraat, half a mile from the small village of Alveringem. It’s also less than 15 miles from the coast, making it well placed for those who fancy a swim in the sea, or a visit to Dunkirk and Ostend, both within easy reach. On the doorstep, there are some excellent cycling routes through Alveringem and the neighbouring municipalities of Veurne, Diksmuide and Lo-Reninge.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Zeebrugge. Camping Scheibeekhoeve is an hour’s drive from the port.Camping du Val-d’Oise, FranceSet among woodland where the deer roam free, Camping du Val-d’Oise has just 40 spacious camping pitches, so it’s never overcrowded. Bread is delivered straight from the ovens of a local bakery, and there are waymarked hiking trails through the Thiérarche countryside to the region’s rather magnificent fortified churches. Or you can follow in the paddle strokes of Robert Louis Stevenson by hiring a canoe and setting off down the often frisky waters of the Oise River.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, Camping du Val-d’Oise is two and a half hours’ drive away.Etangs du Moulin, FranceA little farther afield, in the Aisne countryside, the Etangs du Moulin campsite is truly one of a kind, and perfect for those with children who are resistant to conventional camping. A soupçon of the wild west come to Picardy, the site resembles an old frontier town and offers accommodation in wagons, tipis, log cabins and gypsy caravans (but if you’d rather take your own tent, there’s plenty of space for that too). Twenty-first century comforts include a heated outdoor swimming pool and a Texan-style pub and restaurant, while just beyond the grounds there’s the 9,000-hectatre (22,000-acre) Saint-Gobain forest to explore, which is perfect for both hikers and casual walkers.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, the campsite is less than three hours away by car.Maddybenny farm, Northern IrelandRun by the White family since the 1950s, Maddybenny farm makes an excellent rural base for a coastal adventure. The campsite, tucked behind trees beyond a 17th-century farmhouse, enjoys views down to Portrush, a seaside resort two miles away. There’s a playground for children and, if the weather doesn’t play ball, a games room too. Nearby attractions include the clifftop Mussenden Temple, with its vistas along Downhill Strand, while the pretty seaside town of Ballycastle comes complete with a sandy beach and a harbour. Boats leave there for Rathlin Island, a must for both nature lovers and fans of Robert the Bruce (he reputedly stumbled across his “try, try, try again” spider while in hiding there). The Roe Valley country park is a great place for rambling along the riverbank for a summer picnic or you can head to the ancient market town of Limavady, famous for the Londonderry Air, the tune to Danny Boy.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries has the shortest, fastest and most frequent crossing between Cairnryan and Larne, with up to seven sailings a day and a journey time of two hours. Maddybenny farm is just over an hour’s drive from the port.

Photograph: Brian ArthurThe Algerian government is to fund hundreds of PhD students to study at University of Limerick (UL) under a deal estimated to be worth up to €20 million.UL says the agreement is part of a move by Algeria to to move from French to English as the official language of teaching and learning in third level.Senior academics say the deal is a “game changing” one for UL which will boost the Irish university’s international presence and impact.The move will be supported through a specially designed PhD programme offered to visiting students at UL.Overall the programme will see 400 Algerian PhD students study at UL during the four years of the project.The first phase has seen 117 PhD students, the majority of whom are female, join the international PhD programme in Limerick.UL has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Algerian ministry of education agreeing to the relationship, as well as a contract guaranteeing €5.5 million for UL on the initial intake. This is set to rise to about €20 million over four years.Algeria has decided to change the official language of its higher education system from French to English to increase the visibility of research in its higher education institutions.The PhD was designed after a think tank of specialists and administration officials came together to find ways to open up the international environment for Algerian universities.Second languageProf Helen Kelly-Holmes, executive dean and chair in applied languages, said the initiative is a “game changer in terms of our international presence and impact”.“It builds on our strong reputation in the field of English as a second language, which is continually growing and innovating,” she said.“We have much to learn from the co-operation with Algeria and it is a fantastic opportunity to help shape the future development of higher education in that country.”Arezki Saidani, the Algerian ministry of education’s director of co-operation and interuniversity exchanges, said it looked forward to a “long-term engagement and fruitful collaboration with the University of Limerick”.The Algerian government has been exploring ways of moving from teaching everything through the medium of French to the medium of English in recent years, including how to upskill staff in higher education, trainee teachers and current students.UL’s first engagement with the proposal came through Prof Tewfik Soulimane, an Algerian national who is the head of chemical sciences at UL’s Bernal Institute. Pitch for projectA UL delegation later travelled to Algeria to pitch for the project and was successful.Dr Mairead Moriarty, assistant dean of arts, humanities and social sciences at UL, said its pitch included detailed presentations on how it would host the students, how the programme would look, the types of supports available for international students and how competitive UL was against other Irish and UK universities.“We were told that they needed to start the switch and publish in English and to ensure that their education system is moved over to English quickly,” she said.“Our job now is to bring students, who have competed nationally in Algeria for these scholarships, over to us so that they can be trained on how to teach through the medium of English while also doing a PhD at the same time.”The project team in UL created an international PhD with a taught component of English as a medium of instruction, after which candidates will embark on three years of inidual research resulting in a PhD upon completion.On completion, it says each of the Algerian students will be well-placed to access a lecturing post when they return home.Dr Moriarty said the programme has the potential to provide a significant economic boost for both iniduals and the Algerian economy.“Also the majority of the students are female and if you are putting women in that role of train the trainer, where society is traditionally male-dominated, that is a really strong statement made by government,” she added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183715.1582578713!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"graduates not well equipped for future workplace","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe same study also polled the opinions of more than 600 teachers, parents of secondary school pupils and young adults.Just 13 per cent of employers believe graduates are very well equipped to meet the needs of the future workforce, according to a new survey.Employers say “soft” skills such as communication, work ethic, teamwork and problem-solving will be most needed for the workforce of the future over the coming years.The findings are based on research by Accenture involving 130 employers in Ireland over recent months.The same study also polled the opinions of more than 600 teachers, parents of secondary school pupils and young adults.Overall, it found that education and businesses are at odds over how prepared students are for the working world. Accenture’s Learning to Lead report found that while 66 per cent of teachers think students are equipped, some 42 percent of employers think the opposite.In addition, only 23 percent of employers think the education sector is keeping pace with industry needs. According to the report, the speed and direction of travel in education is an issue for around half of companies. Inside schools, sentiments are similar with students and teachers painting a picture of a second level education system struggling to keep up with the needs of the working world.The report explores how well prepared we are for the changing world of work, as well as the hurdles businesses in Ireland are confronted with today that must be addressed if they are to access a talent pool that can help them innovate and grow. Alastair Blair, country managing director at Accenture in Ireland, said if we want Ireland to continue to provide a talent pool for the innovative companies based here, as well as improve the prospects of home-grown businesses, we must think hard about what they will need.“We have a good education system in Ireland but, according to our report, there are challenges earlier in the education journey - particularly at second level - where the focus is more on aptitude than attitude,” he said.“ This is more than just a research announcement - it’s a call to action for a stronger approach to how government, business and education can work together to shape a society in Ireland fit for the opportunities of tomorrow.”Among students, the report highlights a disconnect between the skills 16-25 year olds believe they will need and what they are taught in the classroom. Only 27 percent feel very prepared for the roles of the future, with 22 percent claiming not to feel prepared at all.The report says this may reflect understandable uncertainty about what future jobs will look like. Most teachers are also concerned that roles and the industries some students want to work in will be obsolete in the future.In fact, almost two thirds of teachers believe that the way subjects are taughtin school equips students adequately for the working world.

Trinity says the plan is part of the university’s response to Ireland’s “bioersity crisis”. Though the area may end up looking less tidy, supporters of the idea say it will be an important reminder of what wild nature looks like. Soil insectsResearch shows lawn-mowing, ground preparation and pesticide control can disturb important insects that feed and nest in the soil. Planting wildflowers and minimising interference, by contrast, can support bioersity and provide a habitat for native insects and food for pollinators in the city centre. The vote will be open to the public and will be launched on Tuesday.Prof John Parnell, chair of Trinity’s grounds and gardens committee and professor of botany, said the area in question is very formal in layout and has for at least 150 years been under grass.“To change it will send out a strong signal that Trinity College Dublin is not bound by the past but engaged with the future,” he said.Hibernating pollinatorsTrinity has already converted large sections of of its campus to wildflower meadows, providing a place to rest, live and feed for insects last year.If the plans get the green light, it will flower in spring and summer and be left untouched over the winter months when pollinator insects – such as butterflies, hoverflies and bees – hibernate.Trinity says the planting would most likely be a mix of annuals and perennials, with as many of them being of known Irish origin as possible. The aim is to extend flowering over as long a period as is possible.Members of the public can vote online (https:vote.onestepcloser.totcdwildflowers) on the plans from this week."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing.

Photograph: Getty ImagesOver the past few days the world appears to have reached a turning point in the two-month battle against novel coronavirus.The Covid-19 disease is now in active transmission in a number of countries outside China, where it originated. In many cases it is clear cases are occurring that have no direct connection with China.Even more worrying, there is evidence of under-reporting in some countries and a failure in some instances to identify the root cause of local outbreaks.And the virus has shown it can spread rapidly in a contained environment such as cruise ships and prisons.Calls are multiplying for the outbreak to be designated a pandemic, although the World Health Organisation (WHO) no longer formally uses this term. With countries as erse as Italy, Iran and South Korea now in the throes of their own outbreaks, the definition of a pandemic – an epidemic spreading worldwide – seems to have been fulfilled.Yet far more important than quibbles over definitions is the approach countries need to take in response to the growing threat posed by the disease.Up to now the approach has been one of containment led by China. It imposed a lockdown on Hubei province where the outbreak started that shut schools and businesses, banned most travel and forced millions of people to stay indoors for weeks.In Ireland, containment has involved the early identification of suspect cases and their separation from the rest of the population. Fortunately, of the scores of tests so far carried out here all have proved negative.Multiple centresBut in a situation where the virus is spreading rapidly in multiple centres, where information is lacking on its origins and its transmissibility, and where systems are threatened with overload, it may make more sense to switch to a policy of mitigation.This means the focus switches from prevention to an attempt to slow down the spread of the disease through the population.Ireland might seem to be a long way off needing mitigation measures, but consider how quickly the Italian authorities have had to react over the weekend to a massive surge in cases there. Their actions – effectively placing the residents of a dozen towns in quarantine and cancelling many public gatherings in the wider region – are a game-changer in European terms, with obvious knock-on implications for the rest of the continent.Expect to hear a lot in the coming days about the need for “social distancing”, which may mean the cancellation of mass events and the curtailment of travel plans, especially ones involving Italy.Not all the news is bad. The number of cases in Hubei is in decline thanks to the stringent measures taken by the Chinese authorities. The disease may not be as dangerous as first thought because less serious cases may be passing under the radar. Covid-19 hardly affects children, and is not serious for most people under age 60.Health serviceWe remain in a race against time. The longer Ireland can avoid having a case, the more time the health service has to be prepared. With time scientists will discover more about the virus and about treatment options and, eventually, a vaccine.Though doubts have been expressed about the ability of the Irish health service to cope with a large number of coronavirus cases, at least it seems to have prepared itself for what might happen. That cannot be said for other sections of society.Are schools and colleges ready for long closures, even if for precautionary reasons?How will businesses cope if key staff are unable to come to work for health reasons?Could we not do more to highlight essential hygiene measures such as handwashing and not touching your face? Shouldn’t hand sanitisers be provided in all public places?Public health experts say that when trying to anticipate infectious disease outbreaks, we hope for the best but prepare for the worst. So far,we’ve been fortunate on the first count, yet it’s questionable whether Irish society has truly readied itself for what might be to come."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183730.1582579508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish health officials to ramp up precautions against coronavirus","story":"Hundreds of people lined up in front of a supermarket in Daegu to buy face masks after most of South Korea\u0027s new coronavirus cases were traced to its fourth largest city.

Photograph:  Miguel MedinaAFP via Getty ImagesPublic health officials are set to announce a major ramping up of precautions against coronavirus as the outbreak approaches a pandemic stage.New travel advice and fresh guidance on the holding of mass gatherings are expected to form part of the response from government departments to the heightened threat posed by the virus.With seven deaths reported in Italy, countries across Europe are scaling up their response to the threat posed by the disease.The new package of Irish measures, which has yet to be finalised, is expected to be announced on Tuesday following a meeting of the Department of Health’s national public health emergency team (NPHET).“Our public health officials are currently meeting with EU counterparts and the European Centre for Disease Control to assess the situation in Italy, Europe and worldwide,” a department spokeswoman said on Monday evening.“This data will be brought to the NPHET meeting, where Ireland’s approach will continue to be considered.”Health workers returning from places where person-to-person transmission of the virus is occurring or who have been in contact with infected patients may be required to go into self-isolation for 14 days as part of new measures under consideration.And with public health experts saying it is only a matter of time before the virus makes its way to Ireland, a dramatic shift in approach is planned should a case be confirmed here. From that point, it is understood, the emphasis will switch from containment to mitigation, and on tracing anyone who has been in contact with a confirmed case.In this phase it is expected that public health officials would have a say in whether mass gatherings such as concerts or football matches could go ahead based on the health risks involved.CancellationThe surge in cases in Italy has forced the cancellation of Ulster’s Pro 14 rugby game against Benetton in Treviso due to take place on Saturday, and may impact on the Ireland versus Italy rugby international to be played in Dublin on March 7th. Some 2,500 Italian\u0026nbspfans are expected to travel for the match.The Department of Foreign Affairs on Monday advised Irish citizens not to travel to areas of Italy affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The revised travel advice applies to 10 specific towns where travel has been restricted, but not to the rest of the country.The chances of a coronavirus case occurring in Ireland have “significantly increased” in light of the Italian outbreak, with the State now preparing for the likelihood that there “could well be a case in Ireland in the coming days and weeks”, Minister for Health Simon Harris acknowledged on Monday.The surge in coronavirus cases wiped €436 billion off the value of European stock markets, with Italian shares suffered their worst day since 2016.The Iseq index of Irish shares was down 4.3 per cent, with Ryanair shares declining by 13 per cent on fears the outbreak in Europe could hamper the travel industry.The head of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Ghebreyesus, said the spread of the virus around the world was not yet at pandemic stage, but acknowledged it had the potential to become one.Speaking in Geneva, Switzerland, Dr Ghebreyesus said the focus must still be on containing the virus in inidual countries, adding that the world was not yet seeing “large scale severe disease or death”.2,618 deathsHe said the WHO was “encouraged by the continued decline in cases in China”, though 77,262 cases have been declared there, including 2,618 deaths.He said outside China there were now 2,074 cases confirmed in 28 countries, and 23 deaths, including a rapid rise in cases in Italy, South Korea and Iran.“The sudden increases of cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” said Dr Ghebreyesus."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184216.1582621960!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"legal sector must take some responsibility for soaring insurance costs say hoteliers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIHF’s outgoing president Michael Lennon says ‘legal costs were now so high they were having ‘hugely detrimental impact on the proper administration of justice’. Photograph: iStock The legal profession must adopt a more reasonable approach to personal injury cases as excessive insurance premiums are seeing a significant number of hotels paying over €1,000 per room this year, the outgoing president of the Irish Hotel Federation has said.Speaking at the IHF annual conference in Galway, Michael Lennon called on the legal profession to adopt a more reasonable approach to personal injury cases, saying it must shoulder some of the responsibility for the excessive cost of public liability insurance, which is threatening the viability of many businesses including some in the hotel sector. He said legal costs were now so high they were having “a hugely detrimental impact on the proper administration of justice”.“The pace of insurance reform continues to be painfully slow. We welcome the establishment of the personal injuries guidelines committee and are hopeful that it will lead to more realistic awards for the future. However, in the meantime, excessive insurance premiums are continuing to hurt many businesses with a significant number of hotels this year paying over €1,000 per room. For an industry that is so price-sensitive, this level of cost is completely unsustainable.” The pace of reform must accelerate, he said.General manager of Fitzgerald’s Woodlands House and Spa in Adare, Co Limerick, David Fitzgerald, told the conference about a compensation claim taken against the hotel. “A compensation claim was settled against us for €50,000, but I know the plaintiff only got €22,000 and it did not even go to court. The legal and administrative costs are things that I think are not being focused on enough”.Mr Fitzgerald said he believes insurance companies, lawyers, assessors and a cohort of professional advisors “have a beneficial interesting in settling instead of contesting”.Mr Fitzgerald made headlines last year when he publicly berated his insurance company for settling a claim which he said should have been defended.On another occasion he was able to successfully defend a claim but his side had to cover their own costs. “The claimants walked away having had a pop at me because they had nothing to lose and we are wide open. We welcome people in to our hotel, anyone can have a pop, nothing happens to them if they are not successful”, he said. “We need to challenge more”.Michael Magnier of the Vienna Woods Hotel in Dunkettle, Cork, has no uncertainty over who to blame. When a claim is made against a hotel, the legal process involves lawyers and a plethora of advisors, assessors and engineers, all of whom need to be paid in what amounts to a separate industry, driving up the costs of insurance, he said. He said he too was aware of many situations where the plaintiff did not receive as much as half of the value of the award. “In one case I know of a person was awarded €70,000 and received about €22,000. “My insurance bill is €156,000 per year. If it was €56,000 imagine what I could do with €100,000. Not for me personally, but to invest in capital expenditure, refurbishment or to simply reduce prices.”Mr Magnier who is chairman of the IHF’s insurance committee said the association’s 1,000 members could provide many tales of injustice. But he said “the worst” can be when a claim is made by a member of staff and that person is out of work drawing social welfare. “We have nothing against a genuine claim but when social welfare is claimed, the Department of Social Welfare comes back to us and says we have to reimburse it. So we have to pay this to the government , even though we pay full employer’s PRSI and of course we have to pay the award through our insurance.”The cost of the red dot on the hotel TV“You know the red dot on your hotel room TV screen, well that costs €1 per week in energy costs. That is €52 per year. In a hotel like this one (in the Galmont Hotel in the city) there are about 220 bedrooms. That is €11,440 per year. Just for keeping the red dot on.”Michael Magnier of the Vienna Woods Hotel in Cork is explaining where the money goes when you pay, for example €150, for a typical Saturday night’s bed and breakfast in an Irish hotel.“Of course the Vat is 13.5 per cent”. On a €150 nightly fee for food and accommodation, the Vat rate has recently risen from 9 to 13 per cent. It now works out at €20.25.Insurance costs would take another €18 per room per night, he says.Commercial rates vary by local authority but a cost per occupied room at his hotel comes to an estimated €8 per night.Overall, he says the “unseen costs” of a hotel room come to about €60 per night. “I would love to be making the €90 profit after the €60 is taken out of the €150, but in fact the money is probably supporting other cost centres in the business”.Other “unseen” cost centres would include gardens, car parks and maintenance, fire regulation compliance and lift safety certification, he said.“And in reality you don’t get €150 every night. In fact at the low season earlier this year we were selling rooms at €89” .Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183571.1582569270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greens meet sinn f%C3%A9in as week of government talks kicks off","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan is pictured speaking to the media after talks with Sinn Féin on Monday. He said  any viable coalition would need ‘around 85-plus’ votes in the Dáil to provide stable government. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.Green Party TDs met Sinn Féin representatives on Monday for preliminary talks about possiblly forming a government, as a week of negotiations between the parties got underway at Leinster House. The Greens have scheduled further talks with Sinn Féin for Tuesday in addition to two days of discussions with Fianna Fáil on Wednesday and Thursday. Party leader Eamon Ryan said he also expected to meet Fine Gael and the Social Democrats before the Dáil reconvenes next week for further votes on who would be the next taoiseach. Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is to meet Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Tuesday to discuss the options for government formation. Fianna Fáil representatives are meeting Independent TDs this week, with Kerry independent Michael Healy-Rae confirming earlier that he and his brother, Danny, and other rural deputies would hold talks with Mr Martin on Tuesday. “This is very welcome as the people want to see their politicians working and talking, to try and put together a programme for Government in order to provide stability for the country,” Mr Healy-Rae said in a tweet. However, sources in all parties say these talks are at an early stage and few in Leinster House expect a breakthrough in time for the Dáil’s next meeting on Thursday of next week. Assist Mr Ryan described the two hours of talks with Sinn Féin as “exploratory” and said he hoped they would assist in future negotiations on a programme for government, which could involve more parties.“Hopefully it’ll help us to set off on the right path,” he said. Asked if he would be in a position to offer Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald his party’s support in the next round of voting on a potential taoiseach, Mr Ryan said the Greens were “not ruling anything out”. However, he said it was not in the gift of the party to make that option “viable”. He said that any viable coalition would need “around 85-plus” votes in the Dáil to provide stable government. A bare majority in the House is 80 TDs. Sinn Féin has 37 TDs following the February 8th election, the same number as Fianna Fáil after it saw Kildare South TD Seán Ó Fearghaíl re-elected as Ceann Comhairle last week. Fine Gael has 35 TDs, Independents and others account for 21 seats with the Greens holding 12 seats, Labour and the Social Democrats both have six TDs and Solidarity-People Before Profit have five. Mr Ryan acknowledged that achieving the 85-plus number would require the support of two of the big three parties, but added that the Greens had not ruled out supporting a minority government. “But it’s very hard to see how it would work on the current numbers. But that doesn’t stop us from talking to Sinn Féin,” he said, adding that the Greens would treat all other parties the same way.Coming togetherHe said that the formation of a government would require a further round of talks, which he hoped would involve several parties coming together. Mr Ryan declined to be drawn into the row between Mr Varadkar and Sinn Féin over a series of rallies planned by the party to press its case for inclusion in the next government. “I don’t disagree with the need to bring your people and your members with you. We’ll be doing something similar. We’ll probably hold not just meeting but probably a couple of meetings with our members to get their view, and to make sure they’re informed,” Mr Ryan said. “So rather than criticising other parties, I’d prefer to concentrate on our own work, our own messaging to our members and the people who voted for us.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183750.1582581503!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mcdonald says sf meetings not an affront to democracy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader  Mary Lou McDonald: “I think it’s much healthier to involve people, to report back to them, to take people’s questions, to listen to them, to listen to people’s ideas.” Photograph:  Michael Mac SweeneyProvisionSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said the idea that public meetings held by her party are “an affront to democracy” is “ridiculous”.An estimated 700 people attended a Sinn Féin meeting on Monday evening in the Rochestown Park Hotel, Cork, with another meeting due to take place in Dublin’s Liberty Hall on Tuesday. Others will be held at venues across the country in the coming weeks.Other parties have criticised Sinn Féin holding the meetings, with Taoiseach and Fine Gael Leo Varadkar saying it was an example of Sinn Féin’s “campaign of intimidation and bullying”. Fianna Fáil TD Darragh O’Brien said the meeting was “right out of the Trump playbook”. Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Ms McDonald said Mr Varadkar’s “comments were completely over the top”, and she accused the Taoiseach of “hysterical overreaction”. “It is obvious that the political establishment are struggling with the result of the election. “I think for any reasonable or sensible person, the suggestion that holding public meetings is somehow an affront to democracy is just ridiculous.“You see, I don’t think it is wise that the election happens, people cast their vote and politicians disappear behind high walls and have discussions and leave people out. “I think it’s much healthier to involve people, to report back to them, to take people’s questions, to listen to them, to listen to people’s ideas.”The Cork meeting, which lasted for an hour and a half, was addressed by Ms McDonald, and was followed by a question-and-answer session with the party leader, housing spokesman Eoin O’Broin, public expenditure spokesman David Cullinane and finance spokesman Pearse Doherty.Questions were asked about issues such as childcare, housing, mental health, disability services, Irish unity and the eligibility age for the State pension.Ms McDonald criticised Mr Varadkar but particularly Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin. She raised Mr Martin’s decision not to talk to Sinn Féin about government formation, saying: “I hope the leader of Fianna Fáil changes his position but he may not.”Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin are due to hold exploratory talks on a potential future coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, as well as other parties and Independents, on Tuesday. Ms McDonald said that, in contrast to his decision not to talk to Sinn Féin, Mr Martin’s “eagerness to run into the arms of Fine Gael is lost on no one”. She said the “first item” between Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar “is who should be taoiseach”. Mr Doherty told the meeting that more than 3,000 people had joined Sinn Féin in the last three weeks, adding that a further 4,000 new members were currently being processed. Role of taoiseachAlso present at the meeting was Solidarity Cork North Central TD Mick Barry, who was one of eight non-Sinn Féin TDs who supported Ms McDonald’s candidacy for the taoiseach’s position in the Dáil last week. The Dáil failed to elect a taoiseach at its first sitting since the general election. Ms McDonald won 45 votes, Mr Martin 41, Mr Varadkar 36 and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan 12. Mr Barry also criticised the comments made by Mr Varadkar, saying the rights of free speech and the right to assemble in public gatherings were essential elements of democracy. “The only intimidation and bullying I see, Leo Varadkar, is from a frightened establishment,” Mr Barry said. However, he once again told Ms McDonald he will withdraw his support for her if she attempts to form a government with Fianna Fáil. “When I cast my vote I was casting my vote for a government that excluded the parties . . . of the vested interests,” he said, claiming these parties were Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. “You will not hold on to my support if you agree to do a deal with Fianna Fáil,” Mr Barry told Ms McDonald.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183631.1582571857!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"timmy dooley secures nomination to contest seanad election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer Fianna Fáil TD for Clare Timmy Dooley will contest the upcoming Seanad election.

It is a very good environment for a more detailed discussion and analysis of legislation,” he said.“There isn’t the same level of acrimony as you would find in the Dáil, people tend to work better together across party lines.

Local Irish businesses are crying out for help.”A number of other candidates for the Seanad elections were announced on Monday, including an activist who has campaigned on behalf of deaf people.Dr John Bosco Conama, a lifelong deaf rights activist, was nominated to the Seanad by the Irish Deaf Society and Chime, the national charity for deafness and hearing loss.DeadlineA deadline for nominations to the Seanad from outside civic society bodies to the five vocational panels that elect 43 of the Seanad’s 60 members was on Monday.Those not in receipt of an “outside” nomination from such bodies can receive an “inside” nomination from politicians, which requires the support of four TDs or Senators. The deadline for these nominations is March 2nd.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will make their final decision on candidates this week with a large number of former TDs in the mix.Sixteen Fianna Fáil TDs lost their seats and the names mentioned so far as would-be Seanad candidates include former Mayo TD Lisa Chambers and former Kildare South TD Fiona O’Loughlin.Twelve Fine Gael TDs lost their seats including Minister of State Seán Kyne, whom the Taoiseach nominated to the Seanad for its remaining few weeks to succeed Frank Feighan, who won a Dáil seat.Fine Gael is focused on securing seats where it has no Dáil representation including Dublin North-West, where Noel Rock lost his seat, Carlow, where Pat Deering lost his seat but has an outside Seanad nomination, Waterford and Tipperary. Most candidates will only know next weekend if they are on the ticket.SuccessfulOther candidates to secure a nomination ahead of Monday’s deadline included Fianna Fáil councillor Aengus O’Rourke, son of former minister Mary O’Rourke, and the party’s former Cork South-West TD Margaret Murphy O’Mahony, who lost her Dáil seat in the general election.Roscommon-based councillor Órla Leyden has been nominated following the retirement of her father Terry Leyden after 18 years in the Upper House.Other outgoing Senators and Dáil candidates nominated include Fine Gael’s Maria Byrne, Martin Conway and Tim Lombard as well as Independent Senators Frances Black, Victor Boyhan, Brian Ó Domhnaill and unionist Ian Marshall.The total electorate for the 43 vocational seats is 1,200, comprising outgoing Senators, TDs and city and county councillors.Six further Senators are chosen by NUI and Trinity College graduates and 11 are selected by the incoming taoiseach."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184195.1582613615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china and south korea report more coronavirus cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Afghan woman wears a protective mask after the first positive case of coronavirus was detected near the Iranian border, in Herat, Afghanistan, on Tuesday.

Photograph: Gabriel KuchtaGettySlovakia stands at a political crossroads ahead of Saturday’s parliamentary election, and its beleaguered Roma minority is being urged to mobilise to help prevent a turn to the extreme right.Roma activists and politicians are calling on their ethnic kin to break with a tradition of poor turnout and vote in record numbers, and they have persuaded seven of the country’s parties to commit to pursuing anti-discrimination reforms in the new parliament.Up to 10 per cent of Slovakia’s 5.4 million people are Roma, but many live in penury on the margins of society, making them an easy target for extremists and even for a ruling party that is using nationalist rhetoric in its bid to retain power.Polls suggest the governing Smer (Direction) party will win the election by only a narrow margin, fuelling speculation that it could join forces with followers of ultra-nationalist Marian Kotleba.The former schoolteacher, who has praised Slovakia’s wartime Nazi puppet state and marched in black uniform similar to that worn by its troops, came to international attention when he was elected as a regional governor in 2013.He lost the post four years later but his People’s Party Our Slovakia (LSNS) remains a force, taking 12 per cent in last year’s European elections and now looking to improve on the 8 per cent it won in the 2016 national ballot. Surveys show the party could take more than 10 per cent on Saturday.“The worst outcome would be Kotleba doing well and somehow going into government with Smer,” says Eugen Radic, mayor of the village of Martinova in central Slovakia.Both men are from a Roma minority which, particularly in eastern Slovakia, still has poor access to education, housing, the job market and healthcare some schools are segregated, driving an early wedge between Roma and ethnic Slovaks.‘Parasites’ labelKotleba has called Roma “parasites” and his party echoes other far-right movements in the region by vowing to “bring order” to mostly Roma districts that they depict as dens of crime and filth.Slovakia’s supreme court last year rejected a bid to outlaw Kotleba’s party, but he still faces extremism charges for using a 2017 charity event to give poor families cheques for €1,488 – a figure with symbolic significance for neo-Nazis.Some observers say the LSNS has toned down its aggressive anti-Roma rhetoric recently to boost its electability, focusing instead on perceived threats from the EU and a “liberal elite” that is supposedly out of touch with the “real Slovakia”.But the threat they pose has not gone away, warns Bari, the Radnovce mayor.“I’m very afraid that if they gain power there will be far more serious problems in the villages,” he says. “Many Roma say that if Kotleba gets into power they will leave Slovakia.”Smer has also helped bring anti-Roma prejudice into the political mainstream: when LSNS deputy Milan Mazurek was fined by the supreme court last year for deriding “Gypsy anti-socials” and comparing Roma children to “animals in a zoo”, Smer leader Robert Fico defended him.“Milan Mazurek said what almost the whole nation thinks and if you execute someone for the truth, you turn him into a national hero,” Fico wrote on Facebook, adding that the police could “enter any pub in Slovakia and lock up all the patrons” for saying similar things.When prosecutors charged Fico with inciting racial hatred, Smer deputies rallied behind a man who served for 10 years as Slovakia’s prime minister between 2006 and 2018.Murdered journalist“If he’s going to be indicted, then so should we, because we agree with him,” they said. The charges against Fico were dropped last month.Fico resigned in 2018 after the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his girlfriend Martina Kusnirova, which sparked a political crisis that has knocked support for Smer down to about 17 per cent, according to surveys.Recent polls put the centrist Olano party in second place and the LSNS in third, followed by four liberal and conservative opposition groups which, if they were able to overcome ideological differences, could form a majority coalition government.One of those groups, the Progressive Slovakia-Together alliance, won Slovakia’s European elections and saw its presidential candidate Zuzana Caputova beat her Smer rival to become head of state last March.“On the day she became president, she said thank you in all the languages of Slovakia, including the Roma language,” says Viktor Teru, country facilitator for the Roma Education Fund in Slovakia and a personal adviser to Caputova. “This was her first message to society – that she is president for everyone.”As president, the lawyer and former environmental activist is a strong counterweight to populism and nationalism in Slovak politics, but it is unclear whether a fractious opposition can unite to oust Smer and keep Kotleba at bay.Smer and the LSNS were not among seven parties that signed a memorandum on Saturday condemning hate speech and pledging to pursue reforms to improve education, healthcare and employment prospects for Roma.“We want Roma voices to reach the political parties, and for there to be dialogue about the demands coming from the Roma community,” says Csaba Horvath, director of the Opre Roma NGO that led the memorandum initiative.“We want to mobilise the community because we are afraid of Kotleba’s party and we know that they are mobilising. We want to say that we are here, we oppose extremism and we are part of Slovakia,” he told The .“We see extremist tendencies and negative attitudes towards Roma getting stronger in the region. That’s why this election is so important – to stop Slovakia going in the same direction.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Britons returning from Italy told to self-isolate as Matt Hancock says he is \u0026#39worried\u0026#39Politics latest news: Brussels to reveal its red lines in trade negotiations with UKSpanish opera star Placido Domingo apologises to women after harassment claimsCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayOutgoing head of MI5 says lack of regulation on \u0026#39wild west\u0026#39 web is \u0026#39mystifying\u0026#39White House calls for $2.5bn urgent coronavirus fundingTuesday morning news briefing: Shaming of WeinsteinComment: Why become a landlord if you can never evict your tenants?What is Julian Assange accused of and why is the WikiLeaks founder being extradited?Stop and search on young women could save them from being exploited by gangs, charity chief saysEco-terrorists will be \u0026#39an increasing threat\u0026#39 to companies, forcing CEOs to hire online bodyguardsGui Minhai sentenced to 10 years in China after being disappeared in 2015US and South Korea mull scaling back exercises amid fears coronavirus could hit region\u0026#39s militaryHarvey Weinstein\u0026#39s accusers express relief at guilty verdict - and hail \u0026#39new era of justice\u0026#39UK weather: ice and snow warnings as temperatures set to plungeCoronavirus latest news: Seventh person dies in Italy as outbreak spreadsBBC appeal to youth could \u0026#39destroy\u0026#39 its radio service, Justin Webb warnsNFU head says Boris Johnson must safeguard UK food standards in trade talks with TrumpWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc drama boss defends woke adaptations classic novels","story":"The BBC’s head of drama has insisted that ‘woke’ is not a dirty word, as he argued that the corporation must “repurpose” classic novels by giving them female, black and Asian characters.Period dramas based on stories written 100 or more years ago have to be made more erse for a 21st century British audience, said Piers Wenger, otherwise the BBC would be “in dereliction of our duty”.He was responding to criticism of two recent BBC One adaptations: The War of the Worlds, in which a minor female character from the original HG Wells novel was turned into the heroine of the piece and A Christmas Carol, in which Bob Cratchit had a mixed-raced family and Ebenezer Scrooge blackmailed Mrs Cratchit for sex.“The two adaptations are of books that were written a long time ago. We’re repurposing them for a contemporary audience and they need to speak to a contemporary audience and represent a contemporary world, as well as being stories set in the past. That’s the point of adaptation,” Wenger said.“I really object when I hear the word ‘woke’ used in a pejorative way because what does ‘woke’ really mean? If it means quality being important and fair representation being important then, yes, absolutely that’s important to me.“Whether that is what ‘woke’ means I don’t really know but I do think equality, representation, portrayal and ersity are things that matter hugely to the BBC and and we would be in dereliction of our duty if we didn’t own those particular initiatives.”The BBC’s long-running Doctor Who series has also been accused of falling victim to political correctness, with storylines about the environment, civil rights and Indian Partition. Ratings have fallen since Jodie Whittaker was cast as the new Timelord, and there have been calls for the show to be rested for a year or more.However, speaking at the launch of the corporation’s new drama season, Wenger said: “I worked on Doctor Who myself and produced it for many years and I can honestly say I don’t think it has been in better health editorially.“I think it’s fantastic and the production values have never been better. It’s an incredibly important show for young audiences, still watched by families in a world where there are fewer and fewer shows that have the power to do that.“So it will always be an important show for us and I think we’re a very long way from wanting to rest it.”Other BBC shows criticised by some viewers as ‘woke’ include last year’s Second World War drama World on Fire, which featured a erse cast of characters and a gay couple among the protagonists.The slate of dramas announced yesterday did not feature any period adaptations. Instead, there will be adaptations of two Sally Rooney novels, Conversations with Friends and Normal People, and My Name is Leon, a screen version of Kit de Waal’s novel about a young boy taken into foster care after his mother suffers a breakdown. The next major BBC One drama is Noughts and Crosses, an adaptation of Malorie Blackman’s young adult novel set in a reverse world where the white underclass are subjugated by the ruling black class. It begins on March 5. Wenger warned that turning the BBC into a subscription service, an idea being mulled over by the Government, would mean that its drama could no longer represent “the whole sweep” of Britain.  “It would be a massive loss not to have the breadth of drama that we make - to represent the whole country, represent all of the different nations, class ersity and ersity more widely. All of that would be gone, and I think that would be a shame,” he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/interiors/2019/09/11/best-sewing-machine-for-beginners_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxnlSljj15z1o8iKqMGA7tyH0-jRUT4rHK8EgtaGoQwQ.jp","title":"make do mend children dont know even means","story":"In the days of tectonically slow fashion, everyone’s mother had a Singer sewing machine and would not hesitate to use it.Every year in the course of my spring clean – not so much serene Marie Kondo, more overanxious Womble threatened with eviction under fly tipping bylaws – a peculiar little wooden object turns up. Smooth, curved and tactile, it resembles the sort of Italian cremini that are most delicious served in a cream sauce with homemade pappardelle and is very precious to me.“What is that?” A passing tween- or teenager will ask in bafflement. Why it is Mummy’s darning mushroom! I cry. Isn’t it marvellous? And as I inherited it from your grandmother, it is the nearest you will get to a bona fide heirloom from the distaff side of the family.Where to begin? Mending and making-do is yet another life skill that has atrophied away, along with how to jug a hare and prettily decline an unwanted marriage proposal. Not that sewing was ever strictly for the ladies of the house. As recently as WWII, a “housewife” holdall was a component of every military man’s kit, containing a thimble, needles, balls of darning wool to repair socks, thread the same colour as his uniform, spare buttons and safety pins.But according to handicraft champion Kirstie Allsopp, in 2020 a missing button is the number one reason why 350,000 tonnes of wearable clothing ends up in UK landfill annually. What sort of useless big baby can’t replace a button? Or even take the item along to the nearest dry cleaner’s for a swift repair? In part in reaction, make-do and mend is apparently enjoying something of a comeback, particularly among eco-conscious youngsters who cannot see the irony of blaming their grandparents for destroying the planet.It’ll be a steep hill to climb. The insane proliferation of cheap viscose garments means it’s often more cost effective to throw something away than mend it. It’s become so significant an issue that big brands such as Whistles are offering free alterations and repairs. Allsopp thinks children should be taught how to do these things at school and I am inclined to agree – up to a point.My husband, who attended a gusty boarding school where the chaps wore scratchy woollen beagling socks to yomp about the North York moors, is all too familiar with the concept of darning. But, as the youngest of four boys, he developed such an aversion to the tell-tale signs of a hand-me-down he prefers to bin his M\u0026ampS socks once his big toe breaches the seam.I scold from the sidelines but then I remember disconsolately wearing fifth-hand jeans patched so repeatedly that eventually the back pockets were sacrificed to cover the knees. It would have been humiliating except in those dark days of tectonically slow fashion, when Primark was just a Dublin store called Penneys, everyone’s mother had a Singer sewing machine and would not hesitate to use it.Fabrics were of better quality back then garments were made to last because they had to last. No household was without a sewing basket, or dare I say it, a darling wooden darning mushroom. Can we go back to those days? I don’t know.

Because they hope to make money by doing so. In most circumstances, the profits are not large, because the costs are high, but it is worth doing because the house owned is a store of value and a hedge against inflation. What will landlords do if the opportunity for profit disappears? They will stop offering houses for rent if they possibly can. New landlords will not come forward to replace them.Yet the Government is toying with the idea of getting rid of Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Property Act. This section allows a landlord to ask a sitting tenant to quit at the end of an agreed period. If it is abolished, so that no notice to quit can ever be issued to a tenant, the incentive to let disappears. The value of the property thus encumbered drops, sometimes halves. Besides, sitting tenancies require rent controls to work, so the landlord will be stuck, not only with the tenant, but with every prospect of lower returns as time passes.The effect on small-scale landlords, most of them natural Tories, could be dire. Would their mortgages any longer meet the banks’ loan-to-value criteria? What would happen to them if the banks demanded repayment? Similar damage would be done to the small builders who look after such properties and are just the sort of aspirant, practical people the country needs.Poorer people certainly suffer greatly from the housing shortage. If it could be shown that sitting tenancies would increase the number of cheap rented homes, then a price to landlords might be worth paying. But in fact the opposite is the case. An unmovable tenant creates, over time, an unworkable business. Some ministers may see this as “levelling up”. Actually, it is more like closing down.The likes of David Dimbleby can be expected to stand up for the BBC, but his views do not necessarily accord with those of the publicWhen vested interests defend themselves, they love preposterous exaggeration. More than 30 years ago, the Government introduced a modest reform which would allow solicitors the same “rights of audience” as barristers. The then Lord Chief Justice described the green paper on the reforms as “one of the most sinister documents ever to emanate from government”. I still laugh whenever I remember this.The distinguished, recently retired broadcaster David Dimbleby describes the present Government’s idea of decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee as “pernicious”. Again, one can only laugh.There are some respectable arguments for the licence fee, but is there any other poll tax bearing most heavily on the poorest and bringing roughly 200,000 people a year before the courts against which Mr Dimbleby thinks it would be “pernicious” to campaign?The Dimblebys earned a regular living from the BBC from 1936, when David’s famous father Richard joined, until last year, when David stood down from Question Time and his brother Jonathan from Any Questions? All three were very good at their jobs. To them, it must be axiomatic that the BBC is so virtuous that refusing to pay for it is a criminal offence. For growing millions, however, that logic is elusive.The Confederation of British Industry – the CBI – is another vested interest which, like the BBC, seemed to lose its reason, and certainly its fairness, during the Brexit wars. Yesterday, its director-general, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, reluctantly admitted that she had not been invited to the Prime Minister’s Brexit trade speech at Greenwich on February 3.Dame Carolyn is polite these days, trying to get her organisation back in the game. But before the general election she was vehement and highly political, first against Brexit, then against no deal, and also against Boris Johnson, stating that the CBI viewed his premiership (before he had attained it) with “deep concern”.The CBI is an important industry body, entitled to its voice but such bodies cannot expect to be close to government policy if they have pitted themselves against the main aims and personnel of that government.Dame Carolyn and her followers are like the trade union barons after Mrs Thatcher came into office in May 1979. The union leaders had tried to run the country before, and they had failed. Mrs Thatcher therefore stopped the custom of giving them “beer and sandwiches at Number Ten”.Over the weekend, two groups of very different persuasions have come to similar conclusions about carbon net zero by 2050, to which the Government is committed. The Global Warming Policy Foundation (on whose board I sit) is sceptical about many policy prescriptions to halt climate change. The Green New Deal Group is run by Leftists and Greens who want to “pull the world back from economic and environmental meltdown”. But they are close to agreement on costs. The GWPF’s new study puts the figures at £100 billion per year (on average) between now and 2050. The Green New Deal agrees on the £100 billion per year figure, but projects that cost over only 20 years.The sum of £100 billion is more than our entire annual spending on education and is two and a half times our annual defence budget. Yet the advisory Committee on Climate Change calls the cost “manageable” and avoids trying to work it out accurately.Whatever your view, isn’t it time the Government admitted the scale of spending and tried to explain why it is needed and how it will be paid for?The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Total spending, including capital investment, rose by 5.5 per cent. The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Millimetre-sized objects, all coming together, raining down on the growing body and making the planet in one go,\u0026nbspsaid associate professor Martin Schiller.Nasa reveals ‘really exciting’ first findings from underneath MarsNot only is this implication of the rapid formation of the Earth interesting for our solar system. It is also interesting to assess how likely it is for planets to form somewhere else in the galaxy.The new study was made possible after scientists examined iron isotopes found on Earth, and comparing them across different meteorites. They found that there is only one type of material that looks similar to that on Earth, known as CI chrondrites.The dust in those meteorites is the best equivalent we have to our own solar system. A similar dust would have once been found in a disc around our growing Sun, in its earlier life, over a process of about five million years.It was in that disc that the planets in the solar system were created. Researchers suggest that the particular make-up of Earth means that it must have already been made during this period, suggesting that it happened early enough that process had already happened.\u0027This added CI dust overprinted the iron composition in the Earth\u0027s mantle, which is only possible if most of the previous iron was already removed into the core. That is why the core formation must have happened early,\u0027 said professor Schiller.\u0027If the Earth\u0027s formation was a random process where you just smashed bodies together, you would never be able to compare the iron composition of the Earth to only one type of meteorite. You would get a mixture of everything.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Stokes claimed the last three wickets in the space of 14 deliveries to wrap up a 189-run winProtesters in London take part in a demonstration in support of a British woman found guilty of lying about being gang raped in CyprusBut the watchdog has received a number of objections in recent years motivated by “a desire to change the law” around admissions, especially in grammar schools.\u0026nbspShan Scott, the chief schools adjudicator, said: “I recognise that many people hold strong views about grammar schools and we receive objections from those who support selective education and from those who oppose it.“However, the role of the adjudicator is to test arrangements against the law and the code as they stand.”In April last year, the King Edward VI Academy Trust, which runs six grammar schools in Birmingham, said it would push ahead with plans to increase the number of disadvantaged children – despite the fact only 27 per cent of parents, alumni and residents were fully in favour of the new entry requirements.In internal documents on the public consultation, seen by The Independent, respondents warned that the elite grammar schools risked being “downgraded” into comprehensive schools – and one parent, who opposed the plans, argued that pupils on free school meals already had more than their peers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailGrammar schools receiving £50m fund not attracting poorer studentsA series of objections were lodged to the Office of Schools Adjudicator (OSA) by the local parents’ group amid the heated row with the King Edward VI Academy Trust – but none of the complaints were upheld.Now new figures from the OSA show that, of the 140 objections about school admissions arrangements received in 2018-19, a total of 58 (41 per cent) were about 36 different grammar schools across England.\u0026nbspParents and members of the public were the single largest group of objectors, accounting for almost three-quarters of all objections, the report says.\u0026nbspBut not all the complaints were about efforts to boost the number of poor pupils in the schools. Some of the objections were on the basis that the grammar schools were not doing enough to widen access.\u0026nbspIt comes after the Department for Education has called on existing grammar schools to alter their admissions policies in a bid to admit more students from disadvantaged backgrounds.Earlier this month, the government announced that nearly £15m of government funding has been handed out to a group of grammar schools to boost the number of poorer pupils they admit.Grammar schools given £15m for expansion despite ersity concernsGrammar schools to prioritise poor local children despite hostility Thousands protest against grammar school plans to boost poorer pupilsMark Fenton, chief executive officer of the Grammar School Heads Association, said: “A large number of grammar schools have chosen to alter their admissions arrangements recently to give priority to disadvantaged children.\u0026nbsp“Any change to a school’s admissions arrangements tends to generate objections and a handful of iniduals have been responsible for multiple objections to grammar schools’ arrangements, hence the relatively high number of cases.”Nuala Burgess, chair of campaign group Comprehensive Future, said: “It seems only fair that these schools should be coming up with plans to boost the numbers of places going to poorer children, and it is hard to believe that any parent could object to this.\u0026nbsp“We suspect that opposition is coming from families who have traditionally taken the lion’s share of grammar school places, and have come to feel that they are theirs by right.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “The strong views held on this issue in both directions reflect one of the difficulties in operating a selective system which is fair to all young people, and illustrates why the government’s policy of funding the expansion of grammar schools is flawed.”On the OSA report, a Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are looking into ways to make it easier for vulnerable pupils to access a school place when they need one and will use the findings of this report to ensure the school admissions system continues to help deliver good school places for even more pupils and parents.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Below is a compilation of all the key information, from release date to the identity of the actor playing the next potentially corrupt officer.When’s it back?There is no word on when to expect the new series, but filming is currently underway in Belfast. Excitingly, the\u0026nbspfirst table read for new episodes took place earlier this month.Going by how long fans have had to wait for previous outings, Line of Duty should be back next spring – the most recent series began in March 2019.However, writer Jed Mercurio told Radio Times in October that he “would hope” the show returns “sometime in 2020”.Who has joined the cast?\u0026nbspKelly McDonald will be playing the shady character\u0026nbspbeing investigated by AC-12. She’ll appear as DCI Joanne Davidson, who is described as “the senior investigating officer of an unsolved murder, whose unconventional conduct raises suspicions at AC-12.” McDonald joins returning cast members Martin Compston (DS Steve Arnott), Vicky McClure (DI Kate Fleming) and Adrian Dunbar (Superintendent Ted Hastings).Mercurio described\u0026nbspJoanne is “the most enigmatic adversary AC-12 have ever faced”.Also joining the cast is Shalom Brune-Franklin (Our Girl), Andi Osho (Kiri) and Prasanna Puwanarajah (Doctor Foster).Perry Fitzpatrick, who previously starred opposite McClure in This Is England, will also appear.Created with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable.

(EC)What else do we know?Other than the fact that the cast members appear to be having a lot of fun while filming the show, not much at all. Recent photos from the show’s set in Belfast have shown Compston, McClure and Dunbar mucking about in between takes – and even poking fun at the identity of the villainous “H”.Mercurio himself has teased the show’s forthcoming plot lines as “ludicrously implausible” – so prepare for plenty more cliffhangers.A big twist in series five revealed that H is not one person, but a group of four high-ranking corrupt law enforcement officials.We currently know the identity of three of those: DI Matthew Cotton (Craig Parkinson), Chief Superintendent Derek Hilton (Paul Higgins) and the lawyer Gill Biggeloe (Polly Walker), who was arrested in the series five finale.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWith Hastings’ name finally cleared, the crew will be attempting to work out the identity of the fourth while also dealing with Joanne.Will there be another series?Considering the\u0026nbspratings the show pulls in – more than eight million viewers per episode – it seems like a certainty the BBC will give the drama another few runs.Mercurio said at the BFI \u0026amp Radio Times Festival: “Once series five has finished airing we’ll have a conversation with the BBC, with a view to whether there’s a possibility to series seven being commissioned.”Line of Duty\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For example, the Amazon Echo Dot was activated when it mistook “kevin’s car” for “Alexa”.The researchers also referred to privacy concerns that these devices have raised in recent years, claiming that their study suggests “these aren’t just hypothetical concerns from paranoid users”.In December, a prominent privacy epert warned that Amazon Echo speakers should not be placed in people’s bedrooms due to the risk of inadvertent spying.Tech expert Hannah Fry revealed that she did not use the smart speaker in upstairs rooms of her house after a data request revealed\u0026nbspthat it had eavesdropped on private conversations.“I think there are some spaces in your home, like the bedroom and bathroom, which should remain completely private,” she said at the time.\u0026nbspApple sends home workers who listened to intimate Siri recordings“There are people who are very senior in the tech world who will not have so much as a smartphone in their bedroom. If a company is offering you a device with an internet-connected microphone at a low price, you have to think about that very carefully.”Earlier this month, a former Amazon executive revealed that he disabled his Alexa-powered smart speaker when he “didn’t want certain conversations to be heard by humans”.Ex-AWS manager Robert Fredrick\u0026nbspmade the revelation after Amazon admitted to employees listening to customer voice recordings made by its Alexa voice assistant.Amazon said recordings were used to train its “speech recognition and natural language understanding systems” and improve its AI assistant.“We take the security and privacy of our customers’ personal information seriously,” the firm said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The FCO worked hard to get them back to the UK securely.“Our number one priority has consistently been the health and safety of UK nationals.”The four Britons on board the Diamond Princess who have recently tested positive for coronavirus were not on the flight.One couple, Sally and David Abel, from Northamptonshire, were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary.Since being diagnosed with the coronavirus, they have both contracted pneumonia. While originally taken to a “lovely hospital”, their family said they have now been moved to a “prison”-like hospital.While stuck onboard the ship, Mr Abel, who identifies as a “staunch Tory”, criticised Boris Johnson’s response to the crisis, saying\u0026nbsphe had “no confidence”\u0026nbspin the prime minister.Around the world, more cases and deaths have been reported, including the second coronavirus patient to die in Italy after a patient succumbed to the virus on Friday night.Britons evacuated from Japan after weeks on quarantined cruise shipCoronavirus: FBI stockpiles hand sanitiser to prepare for pandemicTime running out to stop global spread of coronavirus – WHO warnsCoronavirus cuts China’s greenhouse gas emissions by a quarterItaly’s Ansa news agency cited healthcare sources in confirming the second death on Saturday.South Korea’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than double the number of cases in the country since Friday to 433.The surge in cases, which has made it the largest cluster outside mainland China, was believed to originate from a 61-year-old woman who attended four services in a religious sect before testing positive for the virus.In Iran, health authorities confirmed\u0026nbspa fifth death from the virus on Saturday and said the fataility was from 10 newly confirmed cases.Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, who made the announcement on state TV, said two of the newly detected cases were found in the capital of Tehran and the other eight were in the city of Qom.The World Health Organisation’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday it was concerned about the number of coronavirus cases with no clear epidemiological link.Cases without clear links include those with no travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case, he told a briefing.He also called the reported decline in new cases in China welcome news but urged caution, adding: “It is far too early to make predictions about this outbreak.“Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I think she’s a highly effective home secretary.”The bullying allegations surfaced after a senior Home Office official collapsed following what was described as a “heated” meeting with Ms Patel.Following the MI5 claim, a security service source took the almost-unprecedented step of insisting it was wrong to say information was being withheld from her.“Reports suggesting that the home secretary and MI5 do not have a strong working relationship are simply untrue,” the source said.“The home secretary is briefed daily on intelligence matters in exactly the same way as any previous post holder.

Politicians do that sometimes (Jeremy Corbyn did it in 2017),” it wrote. “We weren’t asked or involved – and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.“For some, our tea just being drunk by someone they don’t like means it’s forever tainted, and they’ve made sure we know it.”How will Sunak please Tory MPs and northern voters?The curator of the account said they had “spent the last three days answering furious accusations and boycott calls” while some people had tried to pull the brand into “a political mudfight”.“It’s easier to be on the receiving end of this as a brand than as an inidual,” the thread said. “There’s more emotional distance and I’ve had a team to support me when it got a bit much.

Reflecting on his own experience, Mr Buttigieg told him:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It took me a long time to figure out how to tell even my best friend that I was gay, let alone to go out there and tell the world.“And to see you willing to come to terms with who you are in a room full of 1,000 people, thousands of people you’ve never met, that’s really something.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jessica Canicosa, a precinct captain for Bernie Sanders, waits to greet caucus voters at Liberty High School in Henderson, NevadaA supporter of Amy Klobuchar in Las Vegas, NevadaHotel workers at the Bellagio in Las Vegas get to grips with voting papers during the Nevada caucusesMichael J Fox –\u0026nbspthe Back to the Future actor turned activist –\u0026nbspspeaks at a rally for Pete Buttigieg at Faiss Middle School in Las VegasVoters at a campaign event for Amy Klobuchar in Reno, NevadaA caricature of Bernie Sanders is projected on to a tree during a rally in Las VegasA woman waits to have a photo taken with Elizabeth Warren during a town hall meeting in Las VegasThe threat of coronavirus and other germ-borne illnesses was on some voters\u0027 minds at the Democratic caucuses in Henderson, NevadaFormer vice-president Joe Biden takes a selfie with a voter in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucusesA member of Mike Bloomberg\u0027s election team in a campaign office in New York CityAmy Klobuchar changes her shoes backstage after giving a speech in Exeter, New HampshireA warmly-wrapped-up dog attends an Elizabeth Warren event at Amherst Elementary School in Nashua, New HampshireBernie Sanders, who romped to victory in New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks to the media in ManchesterLisa Olney, of Wellesley, Massachussets, demonstrates her support for Elizabeth Warren in Nashua, New HampshireJoe Biden was hoping to improve on his poor showing in Iowa in the New Hampshire primaryElizabeth Warren, renowned for giving time to supporters for selfies, works the crowd at the University of New Hampshire in DurhamJoe Biden takes a selfie with a supporter and his child outside a campaign event in Somersworth, New Hampshire on 5 FebruaryElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders quarrel after a confrontation in a TV debate in which Sanders claimed that Warren was not telling the truth about a conversation in which she claimed he had said a woman could not win the presidency on 14 JanuarySupporter Pat Provencher listens to Pete Buttigieg in Laconia, New Hampshire on 4 FebruaryElizabeth Warren jogs away after speaking to reporters during a campaign event in Nashau, New HampshireSupporters of Amy Klobuchar gather before a rally.

Though the Xbox One already has a similar feature, it is limited to just one game.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt will also have support for 120 fps gaming, and raytracing for more realistic environments.All of that is powered by a custom designed processor that sits at the centre of the console. It has four times as much processing power as an Xbox One, Microsoft said. It allows developers to use 12 teraflops of GPU performance: twice as much as the Xbox One X, and more than eight times as much as the original Xbox One.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Game worlds are larger, more dynamic and load in a flash and fast travel is just that – fast, Mr Spencer wrote.PlayStation has also stressed the importance of its SSD to the new PS5, leaning on it as probably the most discussed aspect of its new console. Neither has given enough detail to know which of the new storage systems will be faster.Mr Spencer said that the console was currently being played by people within the company as part of its Takehome programme, and that it had shared the new information as part of a commitment to be open and transparent.

But its simple for users to lie about their age.Last year an NSPCC report found that the  was responsible for six recorded cases of child sex and child abuse images offences.Now disgusted parents have told the Sun Online how their children have been sent explicit, inappropriate and threatening messages from strangers on the app.Thats why we launched our TikTok Time Bomb series - to raise awareness of the risks and urge the site to be better moderated so kids arent left to protect themselves online.Worried parent Nigel Wharton said: I checked my  year old sons account and found five private messages from adults...one telling him they love him.Mum-of-two Robyn Ganley, from Sunderland, was furious when she found a stranger had liked all her ten-year-old daughter Kais photos and commented on them saying wow.She told the Sun Online: I just happened to go through her phone that day and found it.It wasnt any of her friends contacting her, it was someone she didnt know. I reported the account.I was furious when I saw it. I deleted the app, but she re-downloaded it.I hate the app. It really frightens me as a parent how easy it is for people to contact my kids on there.A mum-of-one, from Bradford, who we have chosen not to name, was appalled by what she discovered on her ten-year-old nieces phone.She told the Sun Online: Debbie* was watching another childs live video when a private profile who had no picture started chatting to her via the live comments of the other childs video.This person kept asking personal questions and then proceeded to ask hershe had ever rubbed her private parts. I felt sick to my stomach.The police were called and an officer came to see Debbie.It’s become a magnet for paedophiles as well as a hotbed for violent and extremist content, with TikTok predators exploiting the s young user base and lax security to prey on the vulnerable.Weve seen kids as young as eight being groomed on TikTok, while other creeps take advantage of young girls posting sexualised content of themselves on the .And thats especially worrying on a site which is attracting millions more children every year, with  per cent of kids now owning a smartphone by the age of seven.Thats why we launched our TikTok Time Bomb series — to make sure parents are aware of the risks their kids are being exposed to, and what they can do to better protect them. Everyone agrees social media can be a force for good, but it has to be used the right way and with proper controls in place.We want TikTok to better moderate its content so that it’s not being left to kids to protect themselves online. They informed the family that there had been a lot of calls about similar incidents, where someone with a private profile without a photo had been sending vile messages to children.The mum added: What a lot of parents dont realise is that eventheir child has their account set to private, people can still contact them through comments on another childs video or through comments on another persons live video.The site is definitely not good for young children. Theres some really young people using it and its scary.The police talked to Debbie about the incident, online safety and the dangers of using TikTok.However, while they took the name of the private account, the family said they couldnt track who it was behind the profile.They explained: They [the police] said there are too many of them doing the same thing and it would take up too much of police time and money to follow it up.Another concerned parent Lynn Baldwin, whose nine-year-old son Shae was on the app, said it should be shut down.She said: The site is full of grown men grooming kids and vulnerable people, it should be banned.There were videos promoting drug taking and sexually suggestive content.Shae got lots of follow requests but when I checked them, they had no content on their accounts so I declined them.He was able to sign up when he was nine and no proof was needed of his age.Mum-of-two Carolyn Wilkins, , whose -year-old daughter Izzy uses the app, told Sun Online: Young girls are doing very inappropriate videos which they should not be doing at that age. I was shocked by that.I am in full support of the campaign being run by The Sun Online.In my view, as a parent of a child who uses the app, TikTok needs an overhaul of how the app operates.Its a  for any child groomer or paedophile. Content does not appear to be vetted and neither are user accounts, meaning it is possible for anyone to use it.Its a major personal security issue. I think young users are really putting themselves at risk.Luckily for me, my daughter is extremely savvy and regularly shows me how she uses the app.We have a close relationship and would never respond to anyone unusual.Mum-of-two Ami Roberts, , said she was shocked to find dark and uncomfortable content on the app.She told the Sun Online: What scared me most was the age of some of the children on the app. Who knows who is behind the screen watching When I downloaded the app, I quickly uncovered the dark side of TikTok and it terried me. I really do believe children and vulnerable people need to stay away from this app for their own safety.I saw videos of kids who must have been six or seven years old who were bopping around to music and lip syncing to silly Kardashian sound clips. It really scared me to see children that young on the app and to know their videos could be shown to anyone.She added: I am in full support of The Suns campaign. The app should be better moderated and safer for kids to use.Chris Moralee, , from Bradford, said he was disgusted by what he found on the app on his ten-year-old son Denvers phone.He said: His phone kept flashing up like someone had messaged. I kept seeing this same mans name coming up.The messages he received said ‘hello are you there ’, ‘stop f***ing ignoring me’, then he said ‘I will find you’, ‘where are you ’ He was sending these messages to a ten-year-old. Denver was terried.The person had a picture. I didn’t report it to police because I deleted the app, I wish I had told the police but I was keen to just get rid of it.I went on to my son’s phone to look at what had been sent and I looked at the content.He’s only ten…there must be a way for them to get parents’ permission to get on it. But there’s no way of them verying their age.I had to tell him that not everyone in the world is nice and people do use these sites to send horrible messages and threaten people and stuff.Mr Morales deleted the app on Denvers phone and his sons school held an assembly on the dangers of social media after he alerted them.Vigilante hunters have warned there are thousands of predators on TikTok - but often dont have the right tools to snare paedophiles on the worlds most downloaded app.Paedophile hunting groups claimed the app was a breeding ground for child predators but said they were limited in the powers they had to nail them.Vigilante group Dark Justice told the Sun Online: You can bet there will be thousands of paedophiles on the app. Its a horrible app.Its been a breeding ground since the very beginning with kids being asked to do stuff.You have paedophiles using fame grooming on kids...so they give likes and so on making kids feel popular and then attempt to get images from them.It should be shut down or made into a veried + app.However they said they couldnt use the app to catch paedophiles as they use still images, while TikTok is video based.Jersey-based paedophile hunter Cheyenne OConnor told the Sun Online:  per cent it is a magnet for paedophiles.Its one of the most used apps for children, every kid I know is on it. In every other video youll find vile comments to children. I would say it really is one of the worst at the moment.TikTok user Liz W, , who goes by the name @bitheoji on the app, explained how the app plays into the hands of predators.She said: If some creepy guy just keeps liking videos of younger girls doing similar audios or soundtracks or hashtags, those are going to keep coming up on his For You page.So its easier for him to find more victims. And I think thats what makes it so easy for predators to come on it and victimise young children.In our latest probe into TikTok we found a user with the name Jimmy Saviles Us.In less than five minutes we found comments underneath videos of schoolchildren dancing and singing such as Wowwww sooooo harrrdddd, Rahh lads be careful  on da line but looking good, Probs  lads, any of you up for sale, this song makes me horny baby and Id so go all  shades on the ginger one in glasses.Others posted comments too graphic for The Sun Online to publish.Last year TikTok was ordered to pay about £.million to settle accusations that it violated childrens privacy law.Campaigners have warned of the risks of young people falling prey to paedophiles on the app.Andy Burrows, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, told the Sun Online: Serious questions need to be asked about TikToks moderation practicesusers are able to freely post sexually suggestive comments to children.Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardos, said: Without the right security settings, children broadcasting live video of themselves in their bedrooms over the internet could be targeted by abusers.Go private:Shut out weirdos:Restricted Mode ON:Family Safety Mode:In response, the app said safety was its top priority.A spokesperson from TikTok, which last week announced a new feature to allow parents to control what their kids view, said: We have a number of protective measures in place to reduce the opportunity for misuse and were constantly evolving our measures to further strengthen safety on TikTok. For example, we now prompt any new user under  to make their account private at set-up and again before they publish for the first time.We enable anybody - whether a TikTok user or not - to use our reportingto flag any content or account they deem inappropriate.While our protections wont catch every instance of inappropriate content, we continue to rapidly expand our content moderation teams and improve our technologies and policies so that TikTok can remain a place for positive creative expression.*Name has been changedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He wants to belong to a part of society that he doesn’t belong to.He’s not the typical drug dealer, the stereotype of the rancher that stays in his little town and builds the biggest and most horrendous house, and uses money to fix the plaza and the church.This guy left his hometown behind and moved to Guadalajara to build his empire.In the early s, as US law enforcers cracked down on illegal trafficking into Florida, Colombians were forced to look to Mexico for their main smuggling routes into the US.Gallardo persuaded corrupt officials to turn a blind eye, then bought up runways, planes and trucks to establish a stranglehold on ways out of the country. He built a trusted network of traffickers - including an ambitious young smuggler known as Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, who he took on as his driver.Impressed by his business, Colombias Cali cartel - who had battled for supremacy with Pablo Escobar - agreed to give Guadalajara a  per cent cut of all cocaine they transported from the country.By the mid s, Gallardos syndicate was raking in more than  billion per year.He had become unstoppable... almost.Gallardos incredible rise to king of Mexicos underworld had peaked the curiosity of Camarena, a tenacious DEA agent who relentlessly pursued Guadalajaras operation for months.His snooping culminated in the torching of a huge marijuana field that had formed the basis of the kingpins early drugs empire.Gallardo was furious. In revenge, his men ambushed Camarena at gunpoint on February , , bundling him into a car as he crossed the road to meet his we in Guadalajara.Along with Mexican pilot Alfredo Zavala, he was blindfolded and hauled to a remote ranch where he was brutally tortured for more than  hours.During this time, it is believed his skull was drilled into with a power tool and his face crushed with a tire iron.To keep him alive, a cartel doctor injected directly into his heart with drugs, prolonging his agony for hours.When the mutilated bodies of Camarena and Zavala were found nearly a month later, the hunt for their killers led to the largest cartel crackdown in US history.Trust between America and Mexico was decimated - a relationship still bruised to this day.And as the DEA sought vengeance, the first name on everyones lips was Gallardo.The crackdown came instantly. Quintero and Carillo - Gallardos partners and most trusted associates - were quickly snared by police.The crime boss himself reportedly fell back on his corrupt pals within the Mexican authorities, and was able to lie low for four years.When he was finally caught in , he was wearing his bathrobe.We started to do wire intercepts and we tracked him to a residence in Guadalajara — he never left Guadalajara, that was his power base, Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA, told Business Insider.Sentenced to  years in jail for Camarenas murder, the so-called Caesar scrambled for a way to keep his kingdom together.From prison, he organised a summit of his most trusted crime lords. While little love was lost between them, Gallardo masterminded an uneasy truce.He ided up the territories owned by Guadalajara between the members, branching them off into groups that included the Sinaloan, Tijuana and Juarez cartels - and making it harder for investigators to track.As he rotted in jail, though, Gallardo struggled to retain influence at the top of the operation.The power vacuum fired the starting gun on the war that would consume Mexico for decades.In particular, El Chapo - who had become one of Gallardos close partners - hoovered up more routes for his blossoming Sinaloan cartel.Seeking to perfect his mentors smuggling operation, he began engineering the series of improbable tunnels beneath beneath the US-Mexico border for which hed become infamous.In the process, the bitter rivalry between the Sinaloa, Tijuana and Juarez cartels exploded.A  hit on El Chapos close associate sparked a series of tit-for-tat assassinations, eventually leading to the gang lords arrest and infamous escapes from jail.Once the Mexican military began to fight back in , the stage was set for what has today become known as the Mexican Drug War.Gallardo, meanwhile, remains in jail - having failed to engineer a retrial that was finally quashed in .This guy was a ruthless killer. He was an inidual that caused untold harm to the United States, to his country, Mexico, says Vigil.His failed legacy may continue to haunt South America for decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is cheaper to buy, but contains moisture and when burned gives off more smoke and pollution than dry wood.It is also harder to set alight, and dficult to burn.Burning wet wood can also lead to a build-up of soot and sticky creosote inside of the burner.Dry wood has usually been dried out in a kiln and has a moisture content of % or less.If you are chopping your own wood to burn, it will need to be dried out for around a year in order to be classied as dry.

But it is already clear the UK and the EU are MILES APART on how any deal would work — and moving further away from each other.Brussels insists this country signs up to stringent rules on a “level playing field” and governance before the talks can proceed. This means they want the UK to agree to stick to a bunch of EU rules even after we have left.At the same time, they want a structure where the EU’s own institutions have a key role in decidingthe UK is doing this or not.The EU view is that the UK will ultimately agree to these demands because the EU is so much bigger.One figure on the European side dismisses the idea that the UK and the EU are “sovereign equals”, pointing out that the EU has a population of million to our million.They think economic reality and the threat of long queues of lorries at Dover will lead to the UK backing down.But the Government is not going to do that. It thinks agreeing to these restrictions would destroy the whole point of Brexit: Our ability to do things dferently.Boris Johnson has been praising chief negotiator David Frost’s speech making this point as “magnicent” to anyone who’ll listen.If the EU insists on these preconditions in the opening round of negotiations, scheduled for the first week of March, the Government will dismiss the talks as pointless.Inside No, they believe Brussels does not realise how much has changed since the General Election.One source tells me: “The EU, understandably, are treating this negotiation like the previous one. But our hand is much stronger because of the mandate we’ve been given by voters.”Downing Street hopes Frost’s speech this week will make the European side realise we are serious about not accepting EU preconditions.One insider points out that Boris Johnson needn’t have an election until  — so nearly every European leader would pay the price at the ballot box before he does for any economic disruption caused by the failure of negotiations.When I asked one Secretary of State why the Government was so adamant that everything had to be settled by the end of this year, I was told: “If there are hiccups, it is better for them to happen in Year One of a government, not Year Three.”It is not just on the future relationship that the UK and EU are heading for a row.A figure close to the negotiations says they are “starting to wake up in Brussels to the fact we have a totally dferent interpretation of the Irish protocol”, which covers arrangements for the Irish border.The appointments of Suella Braverman as Attorney-General and Brandon Lewis as Northern Ireland Secretary indicates the Government is preparing to take a robust approach.This will infuriate the EU side, which believes these arrangements have already been agreed.Interestingly, influential figures on both sides hope the blow-up in trade talks comes SOONER rather than later.Why  Because they think it is only once the two sides have realised just how far apart they really are that the serious negotiations can begin.DOWNING Street is acutely aware that one of the biggest dangers to this government is LOSING VOTERS’ TRUST.If people come to see this administration as just another bunch of politicians who don’t do what they said they would, then it is doomed.No also knows that Boris Johnson’s opponents love to attack him as “untrustworthy”.This didn’t hurt him too much at the election because voters regard most politicians as untrustworthy.Butthere was a clear and compelling example of him breaking his word to voters then that could change, and very quickly.This explains why the promises made in the Tory manesto are being treated as holy writ in government.There is a serious point to Boris’s cringe-making call and response with Cabinet ministers about how they are going to hire , more police officers.He knows they need to do this to show a sceptical electorate that he keeps his promises.During the campaign, he admitted that the questions about whether he keeps his word made his “blood boil”.The whole emphasis on promise-keeping is bad news for Heathrow and the third runway.In , Boris promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop it being built. Sothe bulldozers move in on his watch it will be acutely embarrassing.You can just imagine the split screen of his comments and the ground being flattened – it would dramatise the whole trust issue.This is one of the reasons why I think the third runway won’t end up happening.If in the next few weeks the Mayor of London wins his judicial review against the decision to go ahead with it, I doubt the Government will appeal the verdict.But Patel is not the first Home Secretary to have dficult relations with him.Allies of Amber Rudd believed that Rutnam should have gone when she quit over the handling of the Windrush scandal, which was as much an institutional failure as a political one.Friends of hers believe one of the reasons why the review into it has yet to be published is that it makes clear that the institutional Home Office is to blame for what went wrong.The ministers keep changing but the Home Office has not been “fit for purpose” for some time.It is proof that effective government is going to require reform of Whitehall.I understand Trump spontaneously raises the issue with social confidants, as well as figures inside his administration. He complains about the “betrayal” it represents.It isn’t just Trump who is cross. A host of Tory MPs are still pushing No to give an indication as to when the  per cent cap on Huawei involvement in the G network will be reduced to zero.The question is whether Boris will have done anything to address these concerns before he heads to the US for the G summit and a meeting with Trump in JuneThe contest hasn’t captured the public’s imagination and it has mostly served as a reminder of how in hock Labour still is to Corbynite ideology.None of the three remaining candidates is proposing the kind of break from the Corbyn years that is needed.Until it can break these shackles, Labour won’t be a national party again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson must know this is his one big chance for a bold and imaginative boost to the whole economy.As a senior minister warned on Sunday: “You don’t make the North rich by making the South poor.“Nor did the Red Wall ­collapse because those new Tory voters wanted more socialism.”Sunak’s first Budget should be the single most ­dramatic moment of the early Johnson era, setting Brexit Britain’s course as a sovereign trading nation.March , , must stand comparison with the stunning Tory Budgets of Geoffrey Howe in  and Nigel Lawson in  — both high water marks in the fortunes of post-war Britain.Otherwise, what was the point of the bombshell Cabinet shake-up that toppled Sajid Javid and sent shockwaves through our mandarin-dominated Whitehall machine Budget Day is an unrepeatable chance to show that UK plc is open for business — and begin repairing the damage inflicted by previous Chancellors.It’s no good saying Sunak had only four weeks to rewrite Javid’s tax and spending plans.What is the point of a whizz-kid with all those Goldman Sachs-charged brain cellshe can’t deliver the revolution we need This opportunity — more or less marking Boris Johnson’s first  days since the election — will not come again.If the Treasury has been doing its job, it will have drafted contingency plans for every possible challenge — tax cuts, spending leaps, higher thresholds or merging income tax with National Insurance contributions.It will have cost-and-benefit assessments for all eventualities, from a new p top rate to picking cities like Liverpool, Belfast and Glasgow as job-magnet freeports.The Treasury has a blinkered view about tax. It is a means of raising money, on a one-way ratchet.The Treasury does not do “dynamic” economics — lowering taxes and leaving voters to splash their newly acquired cash.This is where Sunak can earn his spurs as an innovative, daring, free-thinking Treasury boss. Stamp duty tops everyone’s calls for reform.George Osborne’s loathed property tax hike paralysed the housing market, locked up billions in hoarded capital, destroyed job mobility — and reduced Treasury revenues.Cutting stamp duty would instantly free up spending and boost the whole economy — especially for tradesmen and the hard-hit High Street.Speaking of shops, business rates need drastic reform to save our shuttered town centres. Why not tax the property owners instead of their struggling tenant shop-keepers All these measures would boost productivity — the amount we earn as a country for every hour worked.Ours is woeful. The average French worker produces more in four days than we do in a full week.Firms have learned to rely on cheap foreign labour, subsidised by taxpayers with welfare top-ups.Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration shake-up will cut the flow of cheap labour and force firms to pay proper wages for low-paid care home and service industry workers.The Chancellor can also help by reforming the Factory Tax and encouraging firms to invest in new machinery and technology — the key to economic growth.Whatever Sunak does on March , his duty is to make sure Britain is braced and ready for Brexit.Whatever he does will upset the critics. Sir Geoffrey Howe’s revolutionary  Budget was denounced by  “top” economists in The Times.In , the SNP’s Alex Salmond was booted out of the Commons for heckling Nigel Lawson’s tax-slashing measures.Together those controversial budgets cured Britain as the Sick Man Of Europe and began  years of unbroken economic growth.We need Rishi Sunak to walk in their giant footsteps and turn Britain into the offshore economic dynamo so feared by our erstwhile European partners.It has bluffed its way through the past few decadesby posturing as an integrated political and economic colossus.In reality, like the Wizard Of Oz, it has concealed its naked corruption, barefaced greed and brazen incompetence behind a curtain of bluster and denial.Britain was always there to impose reality on this world of self-delusion.

Max spoke of his hope that the new law will help to save countless lives. “I would love to see it making that dference,” said the schoolboy, of Winsford, Cheshire. “I hope families tell one another what they wantthe worst should happen. “That will make it so much easier for transplant teams to approach them.” He added: “When you are waiting for a transplant, every day counts.

Stuart Gulleford has been given a Parliamentary Pass as part of his role in Ms Patel’s constituency team. His comments have been branded “regressive, outdated” and totally unacceptable.Mr Gulleford stood for Ukip as a candidate in the  General Election and a council candidate for the party in .He also worked as a regional press officer for Ukip until , and as a political advisor to Stuart Agnew, then Ukip’s MEP for the East of England. In a  column for the website Ukip Daily, he questioned whether it was right to consider female police officers and forces personnel exactly the same as men and whether they should be sent into the front lines at riots and in war zones. He also raised concerns about the cost of servicewomen becoming pregnant, and said women were at risk from hundreds of thousands of men coming to the UK from countries where women are treated like posessions. As Home Secretary, Ms Patel is the most senior member of the government responsible for police and immigration policy. I would argue that an injury to woman’s face, particularlyit is permanent, is infinitely more devastating than it is to a man getting the same injury,” he wrote in the article, entitled Political Correctness - the New Extremism  “Do we really think, as a society, that this inhumanity towards women is right   That we should eradicate all the many ways that women and men are dferent ” “Furthermore,” he added, “do we honestly believe that a female POW captured in a battle is only as vulnerable as a male colleague captured at the same time  In , Mr Gulleford also publicly criticised Brandon Lewis, a former Home Office minister who was promoted to Northern Ireland Secretary in Boris Johnsonaposs reshuffle.He wrote on Twitter: I am deeply unimpressed with the promotion of Brandon Lewis.“I tangled with him when he was Leader of Brentwood Borough Council and the mess he left it in after he moved on was inexcusable. He couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery never mind run the Conservative Party! Mr Gulleford also runs a freelance PR consultancy firm, which he says he is not required to declare on the Register of interests for Membersapos Researchers and Staff. Approached for comment, Mr Gulleford said: “My present employment has nothing to do with my previous employment. “I am currently employed by Priti Patel MP on a part time basis to look after constituency appointments and any other work I do in my own time is fully in line with [Parliamentary expenses watchdog] IPSA rules.”  Louise Haigh, Labouraposs Shadow Policing Minister, said: I served in the police and know first-hand the bravery and dedication of female police officers. This kind of sexism does real damage and demeans their contribution to our country.” “The Home Secretary should speak up for female police officers and condemn these thoughtless comments.” “Andhe has improperly failed to declare a business interest, then there are further serious questions for her to answer.” Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperon Christine Jardine said: The regressive, outdated views publicly shared by Gulleford should have automatically ruled him out of a role. His comments about women police officers are totally unacceptable and beg the question as to why Patel would think he was a reasonable appointment. This Conservative government must stop their retrograde approach to the appointment of Advisers and other key staff. From eugenics to misogyny, those with these views should have no place in British politics. Elsewhere in his article, Mr Gulleford wrote with concern about claims that  servicewomen had to be evacuated from Iraq because they were pregnant. “One can only wonder at the expense in carrying out these evacuations and finding replacements, never mind the cost of the training that went into preparing the personnel who became pregnant on active service, for their missions.  “A pregnant soldier, sailor or aircrew is a major loss to any unit and particularly so in these times of budget cuts, which have so weakened our armed forces.” "},{"url":null,"title":"council apologises primary school invites","story":"NewsCouncil apologises as primary school invites X-rated entertainer called Flowjob to speakThe decision by Glencoates Primary School in Paisley, Scotland, to invite the adult entertainer to speak to children for LGBT history month provoked a mixed reaction, with some branding criticism as homophobicShareCommentsByAnna Savva:,  FEB NewsThe adult entertainers school visit provoked a debate among parents \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

While some parents questioned whether the adult nature of some of her act made her an appropriate guest for a primary school, Flowjob was backed by the school, an MP and other drag acts.

A spokeswoman said: “The school pupils at Glencoats Primary are currently organising a series of activities and events to mark LGBT History month. “In discussion with pupils in their Rainbow Club, one of their requests was to invite people from the LGBT community to hear about their own experiences growing up and they wanted to invite a drag queen to talk to this group to hear about their own personal experience. “All school visits are arranged and managed with the wellbeing of pupils first and foremost however it is clear in this case, the social media content associated with the speaker’s stage persona is not appropriate for children and had we been aware of this, the visit would not have been arranged. We are sorry for the concern this has caused.”  Women and childrenaposs rights group forwomen.scot were those criticising the choice of speaker, arguing she was not age-appropriate. They wrote: Adult entertainment is for adults.

They are the ones who failed the children and, frankly, exposed Flow. aposaposWe understand why children might think Drag Queens are sparkly and exotic, but they are hardly the norm.

The number one priority was to fly the rainbow pride flag outside our school to show our community we are accepting of everyone and everyone is welcome in our school.  Flowjob herself hit back at critics on Twitter. “Don’t bring your negativity to my profile, she wrote.

Abedi can be seen looking at the crowds of people gathering before the event and the long queues at the box office, just yards from the spot where four days later he wouldto detonate a rucksack bomb packed with shrapnel. His younger brother, Hashem Abedi, , is on trial at the Old Bailey accused of helping him plan the attack in the City Rooms, the foyer where Salman detonated his device, killing  innocent bystanders and injuring hundreds more at the end of an Ariana Grande show on May , . CCTV footage shows Salman Abedi travelling to the Arena venue, spending more than a minute in the City Rooms where crowds can be seen milling around him, before leaving for the nearby Arndale shopping centre.  There he buys four nine volt batteries and a large blue Kangol suitcase, used to transport his bomb-making equipment to the flat he had rented out in the city centre, after leaving his brother with family in Libya and ing alone to the UK on May , . Earlier he was caught on CCTV leaving the flat in Granby Row around pm. The hooded figure, wearing jogging bottoms and white trainers, is seen moving through rush-hour traffic, past commuters scurrying for trains as he travels to Victoria Station. Abedi also swaps his Sim card between phones and takes an untraced international call during the visit, where he walks the perimeter of the Arena venue before going inside to the City Rooms. Afterwards he takes a taxi to a local Screwfix shop to buy electrical cable, halogen bulbs and rolls of tape before ing to his flat at .pm.  Jurors heard the next day he allegedly took the suitcase to Devell House, a block of flats in Rusholme, south Manchester, where on April  the brothers had allegedly left a Nissan Micra, used to store bomb-making chemicals and equipment, until Salman ed from Libya to carry out the final stage of the plan. There, Salman Abedi loads the suitcase and is seen struggling to drag the heavy case up steps back at the city centre apartment, where he assembled the device, it is alleged. Jurors have also been shown CCTV footage allegedly showing Salman taking a taxi to a BQ store in Cheetham Hill where he spent nearly £ on items including , screws, metal nuts, a swing bin, a spade, a saw, glue, tape, a set of drawers and an oak effect door.  Store worker Steven Dooley told police he woke on May  to see the devastating events of the previous evening on the news. He remembered seeing a young man acting suspiciously in the store two days before the attack. In his witness statement, Australian national Mr Dooley said: I saw a male acting suspiciously. My attention was drawn to him mainly because he had his hoodie over his head and I thought he might be shoplting. I made my way towards him to see what he was doing.

George Hood stayed in the low abdominal plank position for eight hours,  minutes and  seconds, which was confirmed as an official Guinness World Record. This comes nine years after the retiree, also previously a Drug Enforcement Administration supervisory special agent, set a previous planking world record of one hour and  minutes. Mr Hood, from Naperville, Illinois, tried to set it again in  but lost out to Mao Weidong from China, who held a plank for eight hours, one minute and one second - going on to make it his mission to reclaim the title. He trained every day for an average of seven hours during the -month lead up to the big day on February  at  Fitness, in Coal City, Illinois, estimating he did around , hours of planking in preparation.Itaposs - hours a day in the plank pose, Mr Hood told CNN. Then I do  pushups a day, , situps a day in sets of a hundred,  leg squats a day. For upper body and the arms, I do approximately  arm curls a day.Referring to the day itself, he swears by listening to s rock music, including Van Halen, with the volume turned right up.  When it gets tough, you know what I do  I turn that music up so loud, youaposd think youaposre at a rock concert. I always had a fantasy of being a rock star back in the aposs. And at least for those eight hours,  minutes and  seconds, I was a rock star, he added. The dad compared the stages of prolonged planking to hitting the wall when running marathons, explaining that the elbows will burn and then bleed, but he drinks lots of water and they eventually turn numb.  When the numbness sets in, Iaposm generally pretty good, he said. Itaposs just a matter of being tired and wanting to stop. The fitness fanatic was also driven on by his goal to raise awareness about mental health, having witnessed first hand through his careers in the military and law enforcement how stigmatised it is. The gym itself specialises in helping to address mental illness through exercise and other professional help. When youaposre in a combat situation, and even in law enforcement with the agents that I used to work with, we get involved in shootings, Mr Hood said.  Some people donapost handle it well because theyaposre burdened with other issues that are running in the background, whether it be marital issues, kid issues or financial problems. Sometimes those things can push people over the edge and they donapost know how to flush it out, how to talk about it. But when they walk through the door at  Fitness, thereaposs hope because thereaposs licensed clinicians there and trainers that will help them get well, he added. The re-crowned record holder could have stopped planking anytime after the eight hour and one minute mark but he kept going to get the aposapos numbers.

As well as filling five of her pantries, with approximately  kilos of rice and  kilos of lentils, she has also stocked up on medicines and weapons - though legal ones. With her son suffering from ADHD, and many companies importing medication from China, she worries that her son will run out of medicinethe borders donapost reopen soon. She said she has stocked up on the bare minimum, with:  packets of Panadol,  packets of aspirin,  packets of Nurofen, antibiotics, and bandages, as well as asthma pumps. Jemma admits she might have gone slightly over the top, saying: We’ve gone a little above and beyond when describing the vegetable seeds and fish tanks they recently bought to breed fish in.   Getting inspiration from zombie apocalypse films, Jemma and her husband have based their preparation around all things that can be traded. So, theyaposve stocked up on food, medicine and tobacco - even melting jewellery just in case they needed to trade silver and gold. Although she laughed at her survival plan, she said it was better to be safe than sorry adding and at the end of the day, everything we have can still be used evennothing happens with the coronavirus.

Two-year-old Arlo was given in at Battersea Dogs  Cats Home when his owners were no longer able to look after him, and his shaggy coat of fluff had become so heavy it even blocked his eyes. The knots in his fur had become so bad that staff at the rescue centre were left no choice but chop it off - and it left adorable Arlo looking like a completely dferent doggo. His appointment with the hairdressers took three people two hours to clip his hair from head to paws, with his excess locks filling a bag weighing .kg when it was finally over. Itaposs left Arlo feeling a lot happier as the mats in his hair were previously so bad it would pull at his skin, leaving him uncomfortable and feeling anxious when he was being handled.Battersea rehoming and welfare manager Rebecca Lodder said: We wouldnapost normally clip a dog with such long hair but as Arlo was in such discomfort, we felt that this was best for his welfare. Dogs with long hair require a lot of grooming and attention. This not only helps to keep them looking smart, but grooming is also vital for their physical health and wellbeing, too.  Arlo is now being trained to show that grooming and being handled by humans can be an enjoyable experience. His original owners were forced to give him up when they had to move into new accommodation which didnapost allow pets but, with the fur out of his eyes, he now has his sights firmly set on finding a new home Rebecca added: Arlo seems to have grown in confidence since having a haircut, too. He can see properly and is so much more comfortable with handling.

The shocking gender pay gap highlighted at the start of Fairtrade Fortnight has led to calls for an end to the “exploitation” of female farm workers. Fairtrade has launched a She Deserves a Living Income campaign to tackle the “abject poverty” endured by “chocolate’s invisible women” who work on plantations for a pittance then have to do all the domestic chores when they get home. The chocolate industry is worth £ billion a year in the UK alone but according to Fairtrade, female workers in Ghana and the Ivory Coast are the worst affected as the two African nations provide % of the world’s cocoa.

A Fairtrade ambassador, she told the Mirror: “As a working woman of Ghanaian British heritage and a lover of chocolate, I am shocked that women working as cocoa farmers across Africa and beyond still live in abject poverty, earning only p a day, yet do the lion’s share of the work on the farm, toiling for an industry worth £ billion a year in the UK alone. “The gender pay gap in chocolate needs to be ended and as consumers we need to stand in solidarity with those women and fight for living incomes for all cocoa farmers. So I’m backing Fairtrade’s She Deserves campaign this Fairtrade Fortnight - will you join me ” Julia Nicoara, director of public engagement at the Fairtrade Foundation, added: “Many of us don’t know the bitter truth of exploited farmers behind much of our chocolate, with women doing much more of the work for much less of the pay.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/DNic_Longhaugh_Nursery_Opening_34824102-388x564.jpg ","title":"003fe2402tea_story__13","story":"Three new nurseries have been opened in Dundee by Lord Provost Ian Borthwick.The nurseries – Longhaugh on Longhaugh Road, Caird View on Ambleside Avenue and Hillview on Yarrow Terrace – are in buildings refurbished for the expansion of early learning and childcare.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “The facilities have been enhanced as part of a £ million council investment programme across the city to provide high quality, fit for purpose learning spaces for young children both indoors and outdoors.“This includes the construction of a new nursery in Douglas due to welcome children in August.”Across Scotland, entitlement to free early learning and childcare is increasing from the current  hours to , hours by August for all three and four year olds and eligible two year olds."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/07/597eff6ed759c-376x564.jpg ","title":"an investment in every woman and girl","story":"In my main article last Monday, I highlighted the fact that all political parties in Holyrood – with the exception of the SNP – intended to back a proposed Bill that would ensure universal and cost-free access to sanitary items in Scotland and help alleviate what has become known as “period poverty”.With the most cost-effective sanitary items now available for less than £, it is a tragic reality that there are women and girls who cannot afford what is not a luxury but a basic necessity.However, there was sustained pressure on the SNP from ious charities, campaign groups and newspaper columnists as well as more than  of their own members urging a change of direction.I wrote a personal email to every SNP elected member urging them to reconsider the party stance to vote down the Bill.I began to receive responses from MSPs, who stated their intention to break rank and support the Bill and, by Wednesday afternoon, the party offered its full backing.Today I will be at the Scottish Parliament for a rally and the afternoon debate in which I look forward to observing the passing of this historic legislation, which is an investment in every woman and girl in Scotland."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/SNS-19245303-Dundee-United-vs.-Dundee-794x564.jpg ","title":"dee aim to show its all change at palmerston park","story":"Dundee’s recent trips to Palmerston haven’t been too successful but the Dark Blues of  have their sights set on changing that this time around.The Dens men have managed just the one victory in their last nine trips to Queen of the South – a -

We worked hard in the window, we did try to get another striker but that’s finished now, it’s the middle of February and everything is now focused on results.”Following the departure of then-top-scorer Danny Johnson, there were worries the Dark Blues would be short-handed at the top end of the pitch.Hemmings, though, had other ideas as he quickly asserted himself at the top of the club’s scoring charts with three goals in his last two games.“Kane has been good all season,” added James.“He took a while to get going with goals but his all-round play is better now.“You create chances, he’ll get you goals – maybe now we’re starting to create chances for him and long may that continue.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/medw-Peter-gallacher-tribute-5-376x564.jpg ","title":"tributes paid to well known dundee window cleaner","story":"Tributes have been paid to a well-known window cleaner, familiar to generations of Dundonians, who died unexpectedly aged .Peter Gallacher, from Lochee, died at Ninewells Hospital on Wednesday following a heart attack.He was born in  at Dundee Royal Infirmary two minutes after his twin brother John.His first steps up his trusty ladder was at the age of , following in his father#s footsteps before retiring at the age of .The Dundee lad cleaned windows across the city, but predominantly the Murraygate and Lochee.He was known and loved by many in the community, and would often stop to chat with folk while he worked.Peter married his we Cora in , and would go on to have two sons, Mark and Sean.When he wasn#t cleaning windows or looking after his family, Peter was refereeing football games in the Dundee Juniors League and visiting pubs in both Lochee and the city centre.John said: #My twin brother was very well known in Lochee.#He had visitors at his house on Rannoch Court every day and he definitely enjoyed his work.

the toilets are “of an appropriate standard”.Their  report said: “The toilets did not have doors, which meant children using the toilet could be seen by anyone in the toilet area.“Staff also kept the main door to the toilet open which meant that children using the toilet could be seen by anyone walking through the corridor. The service should consider how it can address this matter.”Monitors went back in  and again in January  – and the problem was still there.Last January, inspectors rated the environment as “weak” – the second worst of six possible ratings.The report from that inspection said there was a trip hazard, putting child safety at risk, and that children’s privacy and dignity was being affected by the way the toilet area is laid out. Inspectors issued a requirement that the nursery put in temporary measures to maintain privacy until refurbishment could be achieved.The latest report said: “Refurbishment to the toilet facilities had been completed. The toilets were now at an appropriate standard to support children’s dignity, privacy and wellbeing.”Inspectors rated care, support, environment and staffing as “good” – the third-best of six possible ratings.Their report added: “Friendly and caring staff had built positive relationships with the children and families in their care. This contributed to a positive ethos where everyone felt welcomed and included. The children enjoyed delicious and nutritious home-cooked meals and were offered healthy snacks and drinks.”One parent told inspectors: “My child loves nursery.

Certainly Ojo will be.“We’ll be fresher and more equipped to deal with the game.”Ahead of the meeting with the Staggies, McInnes talked about fatigue being a factor in the game, with the squad not getting back from Kilmarnock until after am on Thursday morning.With the scores level at half-time after Mckay’s header made it -, McInnes admitted – given Campbell had been dismissed – he would have been happy with a point.Still, McInnes thinks his team could have defended better for both of the visitors’ goals – with Mckay’s first a late run and header, followed by a sublime finish into the far corner from a tight angle after the striker made a well-timed run behind the Dons’ backline.The manager said: “When you go so long with  men until those last moments of the game, you have to make sure there’s enough resilience to see it out.“It would have been a brilliant point given the circumstances and context,not the fixture.“We went out to win it.“Since Ross County played last Saturday, we’ve played the champions on Sunday, gone down to Kilmarnock and played extra-time, travelled back up and got to our beds at the back of three in the morning.“We’ve had two pretty full-on games since County last played.“I knew the fatigue side of things would be part of it, but it makes it so much more dficult going down to  men.“We spoke at the start of the game as a staff and bunch of boys about getting off to a good start with the first goal.“I’m delighted Curtis managed to continue his good form and get a goal. We knew we’d need something to hang on to and give us oxygen to keep battling away.“But with  men everything became a wee bit more dficult.”McInnes reckons the second yellow Campbell was shown by referee Gavin Duncan for not moving back far enough and blocking Iain Vigurs’ free-kick was a product of his young central midfielder’s naivety and will serve as a “learning curve” for the -year-old.However, he questioned whether cards are consistently shown for this offence.Campbell had earlier been booked for fouling County winger Josh Mullin as he broke forward.McInnes said: “What Dean’s done, you see every week. We had it happen to us at Kilmarnock the other night – we try to take a quick free-kick and the boy walks in front of the ball and blocks it.“The referee didn’t do anything, just dfused the situation and got on with it.“So maybe another referee looks at that situationdferently.“He’s had one foul, then that incident and he’s been sent off. I think it was very harsh on him.“However, whether you’re  or , you know once you’ve been booked you keep your nose clean and keep away from the referee.”"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters the future for organ donation","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPresently around , people in the UK are waiting for organ transplantation. All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae.

I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out.

The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered.

to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

of the biggest in Scotland, with about , patients.Mr Beattie said: ldquoFrom correspondence with local constituents, it was clear to me that action needed to be taken to remedy the ongoing issues in

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo. Beria is trying tae stop spring and the rule orsquo Queen Bride. And we still hae the three days orsquo snaw tae come, but ater that Beria will huv tae flee.ldquoWhy didnrsquot they kill Beria, then itrsquoll be summer all the time  asked one of the older children.The gran smiled. ldquoAngus was Beriarsquos son. They were all related, just like the seasons, although they fought each other for a place they all needed each other and were part of the same family.ldquoJust like us.ldquoAye.ldquoGran, can we have more hot chocolate and can you tell us the other stories about Beria  asked a grandchild.ldquoOrsquo course, said the gran, ldquobut we wud need a hale winter tae tell arsquo the stories aboot her.

Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes.

It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening.

What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age. What baffles women is why, with such a simple formula for success ndash unlike the minefield of female fashion ndash there are still so many men dressing badly."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11058549.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tee-off-scotlands-unique-golf-courses","story":"BELLSHILL GOLF CLUBBellshill Golf Course is situated in the heart of Lanarkshire overlooking Strathclyde Park.

However, community groups across the country have been galvanised of late to save these important Victorian and Edwardian structures.Now one group of students is hoping to help not just restore one sea pool at one picture-postcard village on the Fe coast - but help turn it into a sustainable tourist attraction.Stage  Architecture students at The Glasgow School of Art are undertaking the project which will see them create proposals for building near the historic Pittenweem tidal pool including a st century thermal baths, changing rooms together with a cafe.:Scotlands outdoor pools that you can enjoy this summerLast year The West Braes Project in Fe secured the funding needed to carry out the first phase of work on the regeneration of the Pittenweem tidal pool.: An open-air swimming pool set amongst the rocks on the shore of Dunbar, East Lothian. .The grouprsquos aim is to improve disabled access and create a purpose-built building nearby which could house a heritage centre, toilet and shower facilities, and a community-run cafe.The project team is hoping that work will start on rejuvenating the pool this spring.And the Mackintosh School of Architecture at the GSA is challenging its Stage  students to create proposals for a sustainable building near the sea pool, the designs for which will be driven by considerations of climate change and accessibility.:Wild swimming becomes Scotlands latest tourism crazeGlasgow students have met The West Braes Project team and learn more about both the history of the pool and the plans for its future.ldquoA central tenet of the GSArsquos approach to architecture teaching and learning is that it is grounded in the practical, live brief, says Stage  Leader Kathy Li. ldquoStudents are challenged to bring their creativity to designs that respond to real le scenarios.ldquoWe are delighted to be working with the team from The West Braes Project in Pittenweem as they undertake the rejuvenation of the historic tidal pool. For our students this offers the chance to learn more about the social history of these coastal structures in general and to create designs that envisage a future for Pittenweem tidal pool, especially one that opens up access for as many people as possible.ldquoThere is no question that the biggest challenge that we face as a planet is climate change.

My advice to the Government would be: sit up and pay attention because this is definitely going to affect you.First, a recap of what the report said. The number of pupils achieving passes in the core Higher subjects dropped signicantly in . Maths: down . per cent. English: down .%. And history: down %. There were some subjects that showed an improvement ndash PE and biology for example ndash but overall the picture was grim. And it didnrsquot help that the Government tried to sneak the report out last thing at night when they thought journalists wouldnrsquot be looking. Wrong. It just made the whole thing look worse.The terrible Higher results are also, clearly, a symptom of several deeper problems in Scottish education, but two in particular came up in my conversations with the teachers and parents. First, the effect that large, mixed-ability classes is having on pupils, and second, the effect that workload and staffing is having on teachers. Parents and teachers are worried, and stressed, and have been for years.But let me tell you about one teacher and one parent in particular because theyrsquore the ones who know whatrsquos happening on the ground. The teacher has more than  years of experience in English and works at a city comprehensive with a mixed intake the parent is a mother of two kids at secondary who are also at a mixed-intake school. Both the teacher and the parent have voted SNP in the pastthey also support independence. This is signicant because what they, and others like them, do next is going to affect the Scottish elections in .:Analysis: Does Derek Mackay scandal mark the beginning of the end for the SNP So herersquos what the parent told me. The Curriculum for Excellence isnrsquot working. Class sizes are too big. The wide range of abilities in classrooms is badly affecting the brightest kids who arenrsquot getting pushed to their full potential, with the result that everyone gets a middling mark and results start to suffer. She also said teachers were too aware of the league tables and held some pupils back from National  to make the results look better. And she said she felt forced to get tutors for her boys even though money is tight. The situation is bad, she said, really bad.Now herersquos what the teacher told me. He too said that the Curriculum for Excellence isnrsquot working. He also said pupils are suffering because there are so many kids with additional support needs in mainstream classes with next to no support. Then therersquos staffing. Teachers are sourced from overseas to fill the gaps, but when they arrive, the reality quickly becomes apparent and they leave again, so more teachers are sourced from overseas. The phrase the teacher used to describe the education situation in Scotland was ldquofreefall.The consequences of everything they said are clear. If you have some pupils whose potential isnrsquot being fully realised, and you have some parents employing tutors, the gap between the better-off and less-well-off pupils is going to get worse. In fact, itrsquos already happening. In the words of one parent I spoke to ldquothose who canrsquot afford tutors are seriously stuffed and the government report admits it too: lower-attaining pupils, it says, are not improving at the same rate as higher-attaining pupils. The effect of parental income was also obvious in The Heraldrsquos story at the weekend about the falling number of pupils taking music tuition because some councils have introduced fees.The potential political consequences are also interesting. Some of the people I spoke to are not SNP supporters, but the mother and teacher Irsquove quoted are. They also both voted Yes in , but how theyrsquoll vote in the  Scottish Parliament election is up for grabs. The teacher tells me he spoiled his ballot in last Decemberrsquos General Election and therersquos no way he would vote SNP next year. The parent did vote SNP in Decemberbut said she wonrsquot vote SNP again until the situation in schools improves. She may vote Green, she hasnrsquot decided.:SNP tensions flare after BBC report on Nicola Sturgeons shelf-leWhat this means,replicated more widely, is the SNP is unlikely to advance in  and the majority they need for a second referendum is at risk. Some disgruntled SNP voters will switch to the Greens, like the mother of two says she may do, and this means there could still be a combined Green SNP majority. But with the education situation so bad, and with so many parents and teachers unhappy, therersquos also a chance that enough people will feel unable to vote SNP next time that they will narrowly lose their majority, even with Green support.The issue of independence will, obviously, keep some people in the SNP fold, but increasingly I think some voters are prepared to separate out support for independence and support for the SNP. The teacher and parent I spoke to would still vote Yes to independenceor when they get the chance ndash their support for that hasnrsquot wavered one bit ndash but their disgust and disillusionment with the SNP over education means they are prepared, for the first time, to vote against them at a General Election. They know that failing to support the SNP puts a second referendum at risk but they are prepared to do it anyway and leave the issue of independence for another day.This is perhaps the lesson that the SNP needs to take away from all of this. There are some SNP supporters who think the party is immune from the usual political consequences of doing a bad job on schools or hospitals, and to some extent, for now, it is. I also think scandals like the Derek Mackay affair are not going to have much effect.But on policy and performance, the cracks are there. Theyrsquore in the overcrowded schoolrooms, and in the living rooms where children are getting extra tuition, and in the staffrooms where teachers are talking about their daily struggles. These cracks could grow, or they could heal. But whatever happens, the crisis in education could be the issue that narrowly decides next yearrsquos election."},{"url":null,"title":"sfa-ban-children-12-heading-footballs-comes-force","story":"New guideliness coming into force today alsorecommend that headersshould be restricted for teenagersup to the age of .It follows a landmark Glasgow University studywhich for the first time proved a conclusive link between football and dementia.While the study did not specically draw a link between headers and neurological disease, it has been identied as a possible risk factor and the SFA has said it has a \"duty of care\" to young players.Dr Willie Stewart, who led the Glasgow study, welcomed the guidelinesbut has called for a mandatory ban on children heading footballs and said the practice should also be restricted in the adult game.The updated guidelines take effect immediately but do not recommend an end to headers during matches.The Glasgow University study, published in October last year, found that former professional footballers are three and a half times more likely to die of degenerative brain disease and five times more likely to develop Alzheimers Disease.The Glasgow Catholic Schools Football Association is understood to have already implemented a ban on children under  heading balls during training sessions.Read more: Rare Lisbon Lions print to be auctioned for new Billy McNeill FundThe guidelines state that heading should not be introduced in training sessions from the age of six through to  and shouls be considered low priority from to  years.The practice should also belimited to one session of no more than five headers per week at  years, increasing to  headers per session at  and .Coaches are also encouraged to promote a style of play that limits long passing.Heading burden will remain restricted to one training session per week for  and  year olds and coaches should be mindful of limiting repetitions during that session.Read more: Walter Smith backs SFA plan to ban children under  heading footballsIan Maxwell, Scottish FA Chief Executive: ldquoWhile it is important to re-emphasise there is no research to suggest that heading in younger age groups was a contributory factor in the findings of the FIELD study into professional footballers, nevertheless Scottish football has a duty of care to young people, their parents and those responsible for their wellbeing throughout youth football.ldquoThe updated guidelines are designed to help coaches remove repetitive and unnecessary heading from youth football in the earliest years, with a phased introduction at an age group considered most appropriate by our medical experts.ldquoIt is important to reassure that heading is rare in youth football matches but we are clear that the guidelines should mitigate any potential risks.\"The FA in England have also updated their guidelines but stopped short of introducing an outright ban."},{"url":null,"title":"negotiations-40bn-scottish-budget-face-going-wire","story":"Kate Forbes ndash who took over the brief following the resignation of Derek Mackay over texts he sent a -year-old boy ndash said ministers are grappling withldquounprecedented circumstances this year.It came as retail chiefs warned against a ldquotax rise bidding war and insisted businesses crave stability and certainty.The Greens reached an agreement to allow the minority SNP administration to pass its Budget before the first Holyrood vote last year.MSPs are due to hold an initial vote on the   tax and spending plans on Thursday.But Ms Forbes told the BBC: \"I think this year, were in unprecedented circumstances.

I imagine the team of BBC Scotlandrsquos The Nine do the same when the new edition of Radio Times arrives.One reason for the news programmersquos pitully low, several men and a dog audience numbers, is the sheer strength of the peak time offerings on the main channels.Last night, for example, viewers could have chosen from a new series of MasterChef at pm, the police procedural documentary Murder  , or Flesh and Blood, ITVrsquos latest star-spangled whodunnit set over four nights.Written by Sarah Williams , Flesh and Blood began with a figure on a stretcher and a tease. The unidentied inidual was taken from a storm-lashed beach at night and loaded into an ambulance as a woman, in voiceover, set the scene.ldquoIrsquove known the family for years. I watched the children grow up, and I can honestly say theyrsquove been the perfect neighbours hellip Theyrsquove had their ups and downs. Who hasnrsquot  But I never, ever dreamt it would end like this.Who could resist such an opening, particularly when the narrator - reliable or unreliable  - is Imelda Staunton, playing Mary, the next door neighbour to the perfect family we suspect, and hope, are not so ideal after all.With its beside the Sussex seaside setting and intriguing opening, the ITV thriller has drawn comparisons with Big Little Lies, the Reece Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman-led Golden Globes winner. But Flesh and Blood is more grubby old Blighty in its concerns - nosy neighbour, arguments over money - than Calornia glossy, and it does not take itself too seriously.The plot is that old standby, recently widowed mum takes up with a new man, much to the suspicion of her adult children who worry about her - and their inheritance. It has been more than  months since Vivienlost her husband, and now she is introducing her boyfriend Markto children Jake, Helen and Natalie .Mark, being a retired surgeon, seems like quite the catch initially. Which woman wouldnrsquot want a man who, at a pinch, could perform an appendectomy on the kitchen table He is loving, romantic, attentive, whisking Vivien off to France for a surprise lunch in a private plane. But is he too good to be true Vivienrsquos children are not quite what they seem either, each having their share of secrets and enemies. Then there is singleton Mary next door, an eager little mouse who is always ready to take in a parcel or whip up a batch of cheese straws for Vivienshe is having the family around. Clearly suspicious.The cut where the camera moves from Mary telling the police that she likes to keep herself to herself, to her steaming open a parcel for next door, was wickedly good. Even better was the follow-up.Like Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, Mary has a set of binoculars and they are not used for bird-watching. Between this, the sweeping orchestral score and the sunny setting in which dark events may or may not be taking place, there is an air of faux Hitchcock with slyly comic undertones about Flesh and Blood.

Behind the scenes, though, itrsquos a mess.How can this be  How can a party be doing so well and so bad at the same time  The answer lies in the fact that hardcore independence supporters will cut the SNP any amount of slack when it comes to scandals and mismanagement because itrsquos the only vehicle to get them what they want.That skews democracy, and it hasnt been good for the governance of Scotland.The SNP has been in power since  ndash in political terms thatrsquos an aeon. Over that time, the SNP has conformed to all the ills that beset political parties in office for y periods. Itrsquos got sloppy, fractious, and stupid.

It looked low and crafty.:MacAskill says tells SNP to focus on lsquogrunt workrsquo not marchingWhile education soaks up most of the negative headlines, therersquos also serious problems with policing and hospitals.There was a time ndash maybe five or six years ago, before the world went mad with identity disorder ndash when nearly all voters judged governments on how effective they were in office. Today, thatrsquos not the case for many voters.What matters to many is whether a political party reflects their sense of identity. This becomes a force field of protection, a magical cloak of invincibility. As long as a party reaffirms the identity of their base ndash be that via Brexit or independence ndash it will avoid the kind of supporter dissatisfaction which would end other governments.This creates a huge distortion in public debate ndash the essential cornerstone of democracy.Yet despite having this super-weapon in its possession, the power of identity as political protection, the SNP is now absurdly starting to juggle with live grenades.Itrsquos splitting rapidly on the best path towards independence. Some would like to see Sturgeon go. Independence, which until now has conferred protection, is beginning to damage the party from within.The isions in the party have crystallised in the Holyrood constituency of Edinburgh Central - Ruth Davidsonrsquos old stomping ground. Two big SNP names are jockeying for a place on the ballot - Joanna Cherry and Angus Robertson.The pair represent the two sides of the party split. Cherry is on whatrsquos been called the Salmond side, and Robertson is on the Sturgeon wing. In the crudest of terms, itrsquos the more populist branch versus the social democrat side of the party.:Analysis: Does Derek Mackay scandal mark the beginning of the end for the SNP Therersquos already mutterings of Cherry replacing Sturgeon as party leader. Of course, this isnrsquot the only split in the party. The SNP is also tearing itself apart over the increasingly toxic debate about trans rights.Letrsquos not forget that the SNP has also just gone through the Derek Mackay scandal, and itrsquos still got to weather the fall-out from the coming Alex Salmond trial.So internally, things look pretty awful for the SNP, but in terms of electoral performance and opinion polls the party is laughing hellip for now.Moving against Sturgeon would change the game for the party. Sturgeon has centre-ground appeal. Plenty of Unionist and No voters hate her, but to many people, shersquos seen as professional, decent, intelligent, and with her heart in the right place.Her rivals come across as isive, angry and slippery. The party wouldnrsquot lose its force field of identity, its shield,it lost Sturgeon ndash the base would still be there ndash but it would damage its centre-ground appeal.Of course, Sturgeon is to blame for a lot of this herself. Shersquos teased the base with independence for years in order to keep power.

This was of concern to the committee given the pivotal role music has been proven to play in pupil attainment as well as the positive impact learning an instrument and playing in an ensemble has been shown to have.As committee convener Clare Adamson, the SNP MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw, said at the time: ldquoThere is little doubt about the positive benefits that music can have on us as iniduals, as communities and indeed to the wider Scottish culture and economy.Yet here we are a year later and Edinburgh City Council has just waved through a plan that will see pound, slashed from its music budget between next year and  while yesterday councillors in North Lanarkshire sat down and actually ndash unbelievably ndash discussed the prospect of scrapping the arearsquos music service completely. Representatives in Dumfries and Galloway, who have already faced the wrath of incredulous parents at a series of budget roadshows, will have that very same discussion when they meet on Thursday.They should all be thoroughly ashamed. Take Edinburgh. Though a consultation is to be carried out before any changes are made, the fact that half a million poundsrsquo worth of savings has to be made in the instrumental music service means something is going to have to give. Teacher numbers and instrument choice will almost certainly be cut, while it is all but unavoidable that some kind of charging for lessons will be introduced.The impact that cuts of any kind will have is obvious, with fewer teachers giving lessons in fewer instruments inevitably meaning fewer opportunities to learn. Meanwhile, evidence gathered over the past few years shows that, regardless of any concessions that might be introduced, the introduction of fees will lead to certain children no longer being able to learn. Yes, those with wealthy enough parents will be able to pay or go private and, yes, those from poorer backgrounds will not have to pay at all, but for those in the middle ndash those whose parents are in work but who have no cash to spare ndash their musical future looks bleak. In a country where every child is supposed to have the right to a broad and deep education, that is an unforgivable dereliction of duty.That would be bad enough at the best of times, and the postcode lottery that sees children in Glasgow pay nothing to learn an instrument while their counterparts in Clackmannanshire must pay pound shows just how much some children are already being let down. But in a city that each year becomes a festival-hosting cultural hotspot that puts the whole of Scotland on the global stage that has worked hard to ensure those from its poorest areas are given the most opportunities to attend those festivals and that last year sought in spectacular style to break down some of the perceived barriers to musical attainment by transforming Heart of Midlothianrsquos football ground into a concert arena for the world-famous LA Phil, Edinburgh City Councilrsquos decision is nothing short of perverse.What, after all, is the point in being a world-famous patron of the artsthat doesnrsquot extend to every one of your own schoolchildren  Does Edinburgh really want its future contribution to be a trust-fund backed one Yet while the actions of inidual authorities may be reprehensible, they are only getting away with making these decisions because the Scottish Government ndash the same government that continually talks about the benefits that learning an instrument can bring ndash does not class instrumental tuition as core to the curriculum. That means it doesnrsquot provide specic funding for music lessons, which in turn means that no matter how many times ministers say councils should be providing the service free of charge ndash which is often ndash they are under no obligation to do so.It is hardly surprising, given the never-ending cuts councils have been forced to make, that every bit of discretionary spend has become fair-game at budget-setting time. Yet there is something particularly distasteful about making children shoulder the burden of any of these cuts and something especially fishy about gunning for music at this particular point.Only last week a Scottish Government report revealed that the number of children gaining Highers in core subjects dropped by as much as  per cent in the last academic year while the attainment gap between rich and poor has continued to widen. What better time for three local authorities in which the SNPrsquos influence is weak to highlight a major inconsistency in the Governmentrsquos approach to education And there is something deeply inconsistent in the Government saying on the one hand that music is so central to wellbeing and attainment that is must be provided free while on the other sending councils the message that it is up to them to decide whether to provide it. Yes, it is expensive to provide one-to-one or small-group tuition to children outside a classroom setting and, yes, there are very many demands on government funds.

That’s why it is right that we have a strong regulator to ensure social media firms fulfil their vital responsibility to vulnerable users.”The news was welcomed by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which started campaigning for better regulation of internet sites two years ago.In  , Police Scotland recorded  crimes of communicating indecently with a child, which included online sexual communication.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility. Since then, little progress has been made.“What has happened, however, is that the ferries operating these leline routes have got older, less reliable and more costly to run. Despite the best efforts of crews, we have seen increasing levels of disruption, including the ongoing problems with the MV Eynhallow. This situation is simply not sustainable and needs to be addressed.“Scottish Government needs to agree a clear timetable for taking forward the procurement of replacement vessels so that communities in Orkney have the leline services they deserve.

Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Responding to the murders of at least nine people in Hanau, Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were clear signs that the killer had been motivated by racism.Merkel, of the centre-right CDU party, has been described by some as the new ‘leader of the free world’ because of her strong stance against the sinister ideology espoused by those such as the far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Echoing Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he has declared “the age of liberal democracy is at an end” on the grounds that it is no longer able to “provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture”. Normally the US President is the unofficial leader of the free world, but Donald Trump, quite accurately, views Orban as “probably like me”.: Andrew Sabisky: what the former No.  adviser is alleged to have said about pregnancies, eugenics and race as he steps down: Boris Johnson is not a ‘real racist’ despite Brits criticism, says Home Secretary Priti PatelFor Orban, the Christian culture of Europe is under threat from “Muslim invaders” and there is, and always will be, a great iding line between these two religions. He is right about one thing, but wrong about everything .There is indeed a iding line that separates human beings, not just in Europe, but all over the world. On one side of this line are groups like Isis but also far-right killers such as one in Hanau another who massacred  people in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year and the man who killed  people in attacks in Oslo and the island of Utoya in Norway in .The fascists may view the ‘Islamofascists’ as their deadly enemies, but they are fundamentally the same. Disagree with them too much and they will kill you belong to the wrong group and they will kill you.On the other side are the vast majority of people – of all religions and none – who are decent, peace-loving and respectful of others’ basic right to exist.Racism and other forms of bigotry are ideological mechanisms, societal poisons, that can persuade people to cross this line into a le of violence, murder and death.So , on playing a word association game, you say “terrorist” on hearing “Muslim”, beware, because you are heading in a dangerous direction.The basic premise of liberalism – the prevailing philosophy of all true democracies – is that each and every one of us is an inidual. It is, therefore, the antidote to the poison of prejudice.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how to stay rational about coronavirus in the face of panic dr antonis kousoulis","story":"The Covid- coronavirus outbreak may feel scary to some, but it is important to retain a sense of perspective and seek out reputable sources of information, writes Dr Antonis Kousoulis.The UK is a bit on edge at the moment. Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"family of caroline flack share unpublished instagram she wanted to post","story":"The family of Caroline Flack have released an unpublished Instagram post that the star wrote in the days before her death, in which she said that within  hours her whole world and future had been swept from under her feet.The -year-old former Love Island host, who took her own le, described the domestic incident with boyfriend Lewis Burton as \"an accident\".\"On December the th  I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend,\" she wrote. \"Within  hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed.\"I am suddenly on a dferent kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.\"I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night.\"Even on the night.\"But the truth is ...

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce. Mrs Tymelly, played by Bereen who first had the role in the Lyric in , isof everyone’s secrets as well as one of her own.The actress is no stranger to London, but much has changed since she first travelled there: “I worked in London in the s as a nurse – I did midwery in Beckenham Maternity Hospital, a good bit south of the centre. Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le. Organisations like CALM are the best defence we have against stories that end like Joe’s.”CALM runs a free and confidential helpline and webchat for anyone who needs to talk about le’s problems, available in NI and across the UK.‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ runs until February .Stage set forof one-woman Ruby show Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"pipe band championships to be held in antrim","story":"Around , visitors are expected to attend the second Antrim and Newtownabbey Regional Pipe Band Championship event at Antrim Castle Gardens in June.The event is being organised by the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association of Northern Ireland .The borough council will host the event at a cost of £,.Traditionally, this competition is held on the third Saturday in July but it has been switched this year to avoid a clash with the annual Antrim Agricultural Show in Shanes Castle.The organisers turned down the opportunity of holding the event at V at The Valley, in Newtownabbey.Meanwhile, a craft event is to be moved to an indoor location following concerns over weather and a subsequent reduction in visitor numbers.Mossley Mill has been recommended as the venue for ‘Spinning Yarns’ this September at a cost of £,.The event was held at Antrim Castle Gardens for the past two years and is said by council officers to be “challenged by poor weather”.Although this is described as “an ever present risk year round for any outdoor event but particularly challenging for the audience profile for this specialist event”.Council officers have stated that the numbers “reduced signicantly” to , last year, from , in , which they have acknowledged was “disappointing”.“There is no doubt the poor weather and warning issued impacted upon this.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.NI weather: The Met Office has updated the weather warning for Saturday while a warning for rain comes into effect for parts of NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"A Ballyclare man who slipped into a #dark place# during a bout of mental ill health is cycling across Northern Ireland#s football grounds to raise funds for Action Mental Health.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example.

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young buyers in belfast","story":"IN spite of all the uncertainties young people are confronted with in Belfast and across the north more generally – from Brexit to political instability, to the alleged ‘brain drain’ effect and the looming threat of recession – many still choose to set down long-term roots here. The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus ulster match in treviso postponed and six nations game now in doubt","story":"Consideration: Simon Harris FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappConsideration: Simon HarrisBy Allan PrestonFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailWork to reschedule an Ulster Rugby match in Italy is continuing after it was called off due to coronavirus restrictions.Ulster fans had been due to travel to Treviso in northern Italy for the PRO game against Benetton on Saturday before local authorities stepped in to tackle the spread of the virus.Irish health minister Simon Harris has also said careful consideration is needed over Ireland#s Six Nations clash with Italy in Dublin on March .In what has become Europe#s biggest outbreak, it was reported yesterday that seven people have died from Covid- in Italy and over  have been infected.Some disappointed Ulster supporters accepted the news yesterday while others questionedthey would now be out of pocket.On the Ulster Rugby Facebook page, one said: Very unlikely to be played at all this season.

The club denies the claims.Glens boss Mick McDermott, who replaced Smyth in The Oval hotseat, was also present at the hearing, and the pair shook hands.Neither man spoke during the tribunal but Glentoran director Colin Alexander Jess and club secretary Richard Irvine Rea were both called to provide evidence.The case centres around Smyth#s dismissal from his boyhood club in March .The classy defender enjoyed three spells as a player at The Oval, winning numerous league titles and cups.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSmyth after his appointment at The Oval in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSmyth first ed to the Glens as the new assistant manager alongside fellow club legend Paul Leeman in May .Working under Ronnie McFall and alongside experienced coach Kieran Harding, the quartet were supposed to bring the good times back to the famous club.By January , a poor run of results saw McFall leave his post with Smyth taking charge. Smyth was assisted by Leeman, and Harding stayed on as they attempted to turn the club#s fortunes around.However, in March of last year, Smyth was informed by the club that he would no longer be in charge as he did not have the coaching qualications to meet Uefa licensing requirements.McDermott was named manager by the club#s soon-to-be-owners, led by British-Iranian businessman Ali Shams Mohammad Pour.

He stated that he first became aware of Smyth#s claim around October , , after the Labour Relations Agency sent a letter to The Oval.This would have been the first communication that the club received in this regard, said Mr Jess, who has been a Glentoran director since .We are volunteers and we are not at the club every day and when they received the post they asked me to look into it.

On each occasion there has not been adequate cover for shts within the Ambulance Service the public are at increased risk. A separate Assembly question from Mr Givan found huge overtime costs to plug gaps in the Ambulance Service#s rotas. Some £,, was spent to cover additional hours in the last three years.Mr Givan added: I welcome the Executive putting our health service at the top of its priorities and reform must be made across a wide range of issues.Progress has been made in dealing with the pay dispute but health service reform is a major but necessary task and will only be achieved through support from all sides of the Assembly.Last summer ambulance crews had to be drafted from the Republic of Ireland to help cover major staff shortages.During one weekend in August, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service was down by about  crews - roughly a quarter of its normal workforce.According to the Ambulance Service, reduced levels of cover are mainly due to factors such as staff vacancies, rostered leave and sickness absences. It said that whenever it has not been possible to provide full cover, contingency plans have been instigated to mitigate against an adverse impact on patients.Calls received in ambulance control are prioritised to ensure that the quickest response is provided to the most seriously ill or injured, a spokesman said. He said demand has increased signicantly in recent years without a corresponding increase in ambulance resources.The spokesman said the service is working to address staff shortages and fill existing vacancies with ongoing regional recruitments and training.He said over  additional operational staff will be required to meet demand and achieve response time targets. Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield acknowledged the problems caused by unfilled shts on the public and staff.It is a source of regret to me whenever ambulance cover is depleted due to lack of available resources and the potential impact this may have on the community we serve, he said.I am mindful that as a result of reduced staffing levels some patients wait longer for an ambulance than would otherwise be the case. We continue to prioritise the most urgent calls, but regrettably some lower urgency calls will wait longer and I apologise to patients for that.I would like to express my gratitude to those staff, on the frontline and in ambulance control, who continue to work tirelessly to ensure that an ambulance response is provided to those who have an immediate and le-threatening need.In January it was reported that the Ambulance Service had spent £.m on private ambulances in  .The ambulances - run by private firms and voluntary organisations - were sent to , emergency calls.The Red Cross, St John Ambulance and the Order of Malta are among those used to provide cover.Health union Unison said increasing private ambulance use was concerning and was indicative of problems across the health service.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland temperatures set to plummet as warning issued after snow disruptionFamily and friends pay their last respects to Naomi Lynn after fatal Co Antrim crash#Bomb scare# at Northern Ireland schoolShock as IFA administrator Craig Stanfield dies at Hundreds attend Sinn Fein meeting in Cork to rally support for government efforts,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was unprecedented, not just in Northern Ireland, but for RCN members anywhere to go on strike. Nurses had come to the conclusion that in order to protect patients, they had no choice. This was neither an easy decision, nor one that was taken lightly.As I stood on picket lines with my colleagues, we felt the weight of the health service and the people of Northern Ireland on our shoulders, but we knew it was the right thing to do - for patients.Ms Cullen said it is now imperative that Mr Swann ensures that all proposed measures to address staffing levels are implemented in full.We recognise that it may take some time to resolve this crisis but the sooner we begin, the sooner this will happen and we cannot afford to wait one more day, she said.Unison regional secretary Patricia McKeown said: We will continue to work intensively with the Department of Health to implement the agreement both in relation to pay and to deliver all aspects of the proposals on safe staffing without delay.We recognise that the Health Minister moved quickly after his appointment to endorse this agreement. We expect the minister and the Department to ensure that it is now implemented swtly.Thousands of appointments, operations and other services were cancelled during the strike action, with health officials and unions blaming one another for the disruption.Stormont Executive commitments on health parity and staffing investment are expected to cost £m in  .

The Derry featherweight was hoping to upset the odds when he took on British champion Ryan Walsh at the York Hall in London, live on Sky Sports, but despite starting well, lost a unanimous decision.McCullagh caused a stir last week when he arrived at the pre-match press conference with friend and fellow pro Tyrone McKenna dressed as characters from classic s comedy Dumb and Dumber. McCullagh was in the zone come fight night however and he began strongly but was eventually broken down by Walsh who sent him to the canvas twice throughout the fight. Walsh, who has defended the British title six times since  – including stoppage victories over Belfast’s James Tennyson and Marco McCullough, picked McCullagh as his opponent earlier in the week after picking the Golden Ball in a tournament which promises the winner a two-year, six-figure deal.This was always a huge challenge for McCullagh who stepped up in weight and class to take part in this tournament before cruising past Razaq Najib in the quarterfinals. McCullagh edge a cagey first round before clearly taking the second with straight shots down the middle.Keeping out of range, McCullagh continued to keep Walsh at bay in the third and looked more than comfortable in the early stages.It was much closer in the fourth with Walsh getting closer but the cleaner work came from the Irishman, who was again proving his doubters wrong.Disaster then struck for McCullagh however as the bout entered its second half as a right hook caught him and took away his legs completely. Following a stumble around the ring, he found himself flat on his back and seemingly very hurt. However, to his credit, McCullagh got back up and weathered the storm for the remainder of the round. Walsh was building momentum heading into the seventh round, but McCullagh was fighting back, showing he had recovered well from that knockdown. It all changed again at the start of the eighth round as a big right hand at the start followed by a body assault had McCullagh in trouble. It seemed the end was near but again McCullagh fought back and again made it through the round.Knowing he was now well behind on the scorecards, McCullagh attempted a spirited fightback, but all hope of a comeback was ended when he was forced to take another count, falling forward to his knees following a salvo from Walsh.McCullagh answered the bell from the tenth and managed to grit things out, with the contest going all the way to the judges who confirmed Walsh a unanimous decision winner with scores of -, -, and -. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unfortunately, we dont have an Irish language secondary school yet but there has been a massive intake in the primary schools over the past  to  years,” she said.Cultuacuterlann Uiacute Chanaacutein are celebrating their thbirthday this year and it was marked with the highest intake of adult learners so far with over  learners attending classes weekly.Mayor Michaela Uiacute Bhaoil has said she is delighted to be able to launch Seachtain na Gaeilge and she is looking forward to attending as many events as she can.“Its fantastic that we have organisations like Foras na Gaeilge and Cultuacuterlann Uiacute Chanaacutein in operaton throughout the district as its so important that we promote the language.“Irish schools and organisations do amazing things on such a small budget and when you look at the children who attend Irish schools, it provides fantastic opportunities for the children and their families.”Seachtain na Gaeilge runs from March - and the full programme of events can be found atwww.derrystrabane gaeilge and Culturlann.org. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But before you know it little ‘Mary’ is three years old and you only ever see her at Christmas or on her birthday IF you have time and even then she doesn’t really know who you are.Yes you are working, yes you have your own children, yes you live an hour away etc etc BUT what happened to all those good intentions Good intentions are all well and good, butyou don’t actually do anything well they don’t actually mean anything - it’s the old excuses… could have done, would have done, will do, next time, but in fact you HAVEN’T, DIDN’T and DON’T!I love spending time with my nieces, and my great niece too. I’ve one of them to pick up at twelve o’clock today and I KNOW after she goes home I’ll be hoovering up glitter and sequins for weeks!But when I do collect her, see her as she runs to the door shouting ‘Aunty Jen’ and gives me a huge hug and big smile it makes all the glitter and sequins worthwhile, oh and all the laughing and smiling we’ll do together helps as well! It’s fab being an aunty, and I’m sure it is being an uncle and a godparent too, we can spoil them, treat them, play silly games with them - even have a go on the see saw and slide.We can enjoy going to the cinema and watching the new Disney films, visiting the farm or zoo, making popcorn and snuggling on the couch to watch cartoons, getting messy with paint , dancing around the living room and jumping on the couch to get away from the crocodilesand as they get older doing hair and make up, going on go karts or swimming - great excuse to go on that new slide in the swimming baths .There’s loads of fun to be had together so simply put,you don’t have your niece, nephew or godchild for a visit regularly YOU are the one missing out! Of course I’m not suggesting you should have them every week, every Saturday night .But maybe once every month, six weeks or couple of months for a sleep over - they’ll be so excited.I knowyou’ve got children and so has your brother, sister or friend that this may be hard for you, but maybe you could swop children for the day - then you’ll all get a chance to be that fab aunty, uncle or godparent.Or have your children and your niece, nephew or godchild too - what dference is one more child going to make.Yes parents this means you would have a babysitter but you’ve got to do it for your brother, sister or friend too! As I write quite often, their childhoods go by so fast, it’s the time with you today that creates the bond between you both - this does apply to aunts, uncles and godparents too.As our children become teenagers sometimes they need this ‘other’ trusted and loved adult in their le too - someone to talk to when times are tough, someone to be ‘on their side’, someone to help them make the right choice, a place and person of safety when things are going wrong.And this is what you promised when they were just a baby… ‘I’ll always look out for you, be there for you and be there to help you enjoy the world’.But how will they be able to do thisthey don’t know you, don’t play with you, have days out with you, or sleep overs at your house and only see you at Christmas - evenyou do bring great presents Anyway got to run, off to pick up my niece, take her to McDonald’s for lunch, then the cake shop so she can choose a special cake tor us to share after our tea, then it’s home for glueing, glitter, sequins and paint, before playing Snap, dolls and hairdressers, after that it’s be a bath bomb bath for herthen snuggles with stories before bed!No I won’t be telling her Dad about the sweets and ice cream - it’s my job to enjoy, love AND spoil her! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

But before you know it little ‘Mary’ is three years old and you only ever see her at Christmas or on her birthday IF you have time and even then she doesn’t really know who you are.Yes you are working, yes you have your own children, yes you live an hour away etc etc BUT what happened to all those good intentions Good intentions are all well and good, butyou don’t actually do anything well they don’t actually mean anything - it’s the old excuses… could have done, would have done, will do, next time, but in fact you HAVEN’T, DIDN’T and DON’T!I love spending time with my nieces, and my great niece too. I’ve one of them to pick up at twelve o’clock today and I KNOW after she goes home I’ll be hoovering up glitter and sequins for weeks!But when I do collect her, see her as she runs to the door shouting ‘Aunty Jen’ and gives me a huge hug and big smile it makes all the glitter and sequins worthwhile, oh and all the laughing and smiling we’ll do together helps as well! It’s fab being an aunty, and I’m sure it is being an uncle and a godparent too, we can spoil them, treat them, play silly games with them - even have a go on the see saw and slide.We can enjoy going to the cinema and watching the new Disney films, visiting the farm or zoo, making popcorn and snuggling on the couch to watch cartoons, getting messy with paint , dancing around the living room and jumping on the couch to get away from the crocodilesand as they get older doing hair and make up, going on go karts or swimming - great excuse to go on that new slide in the swimming baths .There’s loads of fun to be had together so simply put,you don’t have your niece, nephew or godchild for a visit regularly YOU are the one missing out! Of course I’m not suggesting you should have them every week, every Saturday night .But maybe once every month, six weeks or couple of months for a sleep over - they’ll be so excited.I knowyou’ve got children and so has your brother, sister or friend that this may be hard for you, but maybe you could swop children for the day - then you’ll all get a chance to be that fab aunty, uncle or godparent.Or have your children and your niece, nephew or godchild too - what dference is one more child going to make.Yes parents this means you would have a babysitter but you’ve got to do it for your brother, sister or friend too! As I write quite often, their childhoods go by so fast, it’s the time with you today that creates the bond between you both - this does apply to aunts, uncles and godparents too.As our children become teenagers sometimes they need this ‘other’ trusted and loved adult in their le too - someone to talk to when times are tough, someone to be ‘on their side’, someone to help them make the right choice, a place and person of safety when things are going wrong.And this is what you promised when they were just a baby… ‘I’ll always look out for you, be there for you and be there to help you enjoy the world’.But how will they be able to do thisthey don’t know you, don’t play with you, have days out with you, or sleep overs at your house and only see you at Christmas - evenyou do bring great presents Anyway got to run, off to pick up my niece, take her to McDonald’s for lunch, then the cake shop so she can choose a special cake tor us to share after our tea, then it’s home for glueing, glitter, sequins and paint, before playing Snap, dolls and hairdressers, after that it’s be a bath bomb bath for herthen snuggles with stories before bed!No I won’t be telling her Dad about the sweets and ice cream - it’s my job to enjoy, love AND spoil her! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE

Within a short time, I was able to get in contact with her relatives who went to her assistance. We were delighted to be able to help and the womanrsquos daughter who lives in Australia, subsequently contacted us via social media to say thanks, he added.One lady who looks forward to her weekly call described the service provided by Good Morning Down as ldquoinvaluable.Killyleagh woman Bernadette Hodgson, who celebrates her th birthday later this year, has benefited from the charityrsquos service since June .The former mill worker said that she cannot praise the volunteers enough and knows from speaking to other service users at the regular get-togethers of all the clients which are organised that everyone feels the same way.ldquoThe service is nothing short of excellent, beamed Bernadette. ldquoI would be lost without the service and know that many other people feel the same way. Someone recommended that I should use the service and I havenrsquot looked back.ldquoGood Morning Down provides a vital service to the local community and has turned my le around. I now know that I am not alone. Before the volunteers started to ring me I felt down and very much alone. The volunteers are always prepared to go the extra mile for you.Bernadette, who received a call on Christmas morning, said all the people who use the service receive birthday cards and Christmas cards, gestures which she says mean so much.ldquoGood Morning Down is a brilliant community asset. It really has changed my le, she said.ldquoI cannot thank the volunteers for all that they do. The service has made a positive impact on my le.Bernadette added: ldquoI have no doubt that every single person that Good Morning Down has contacted over the years is so grateful for that friendly voice at the end of the telephone line. The service is literally a leline for many people.The charityrsquos funders include the Trust House Charitable Foundation, Halax, Garfield Weston Trust, Enkalon, The Community Foundation, Nothern Ireland Housing Executive, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the South Eastern Health and Social Services Trust..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Grandparents.jpg","title":"Grandparents’ Day to mark anniversary  ","story":"CHILDREN at St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield showed up with their grandparents mdash many of whom are former pupils mdash to mark the schoolrsquos th anniversary at a special assembly last Friday.The message of Grandparentsrsquo Day was clear ndash that St Maryrsquos remains a vibrant school at the heart of the parish of Saintfield and Carrickmannon, as it has always been since .Parents, friends and special guests also turned out to mark the event which coincided with Catholic Schools Week.Grainne Lundy, a past pupil who helped organise the event said many grandparents continue to support children and work with parents and governors to ensure pupils receive top quality provision.She said: ldquoPupils of this small, rural school showcased their talents in a wide range of musical instruments including flute, violin, cello and tin whistle and the beautul choir serenaded the guests with a iety of hymns and songs.ldquoIt is no wonder past pupils of St Maryrsquos go on to excel in music at the top grammar schools of east Down.Mrs Lundy added: ldquoThree former pupils will travel to New York with the Assumption Grammar School choir to take part in the St Patrickrsquos Day parade next month, while past pupil Mark McMullan made it to the final of Britainrsquos Got Talent last autumn and is now touring the UK in Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Acting principal Anne Reid attributes the ongoing success of pupils to the fact they receive inidual learning plans which are made possible within the smaller group setting.She said: ldquoWhile academic achievement is important to parents we realise unless our children feel valued, encouraged and challenged, their potential will not be reached.ldquoThis is best achieved through smaller class sizes and a lsquowhole-schoolrsquo approach to personal development where children can interact with a range of pupils.ldquoOur pupils not only excel in music, they have enjoyed many successes in sport and drama as well as enjoying outstanding academic success.On the sporting front Ella Haughey, who is now at Down High School, is a member of the Northern Ireland girlsrsquo soccer team. Matthew Hunter enjoyed Schoolrsquos Cup rugby success with Methodist College and Rory Mullan was a member of St Patrickrsquos Grammar Schoolrsquos McLarnon Cup-winning Gaelic football team.After Fridayrsquos assembly, many of those present braved the wintery weather to visit the childrenrsquos sensory garden in which they planted a range of bulbs and plants in preparation for spring.Funded by the Big Lottery, the garden is an important learning space for pupils with special educational needs ndash an area in which the school excels.Mrs Reid also unveiled exciting plans to extend the sensory provision indoors with the development of a nurture room.Mrs Reid said: ldquoOur new nurture room will be a place where children can be given freedom to express themselves. Our aim is to effectively address the childrenrsquos needs and prevent exclusion from the classroom and any distress caused by them not having the coping skills, through no fault of their own.Garry Hanna, chairman of the board of governors, announced that the school will be providing a free-of-charge breakfast club between am and am each morning to working parents who need early morning childcare.He said: ldquoIn order to allow many of our parents greater flexibility with their working arrangements, we will now provide this free service. This will extend our existing provision so that full wrap-around care from am to pm is in place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Jimmys.jpg","title":"Jimmy’s 10 recce is completed  ","story":"THE Armagh K International Road Race, with accompanying K, is a date eagerly awaited by both runners and spectators alike and this year, with it celebrating its th anniversary, was no exception.Race day miraculously fell between the snow showers earlier in the week which postponed the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country and Storm Dennis which was forecast for the weekend.Conditions on Thursday night were milder than usual which was appreciated by all.The junior races were a thrilling warm up act within the route the seniors would run later.

Well done to the ladies, as this is a daunting event to enter and there were some bad falls in the mass start, so it a relief to report that all our runners survived intact to take part in the senior cross country this weekend in Coleraine. There could not be a greater contrast than the pancake flat sprint pace of Armagh versus the mud and marsh of cross country, so it will be interesting to see how they fare.The final race of the evening was the open menrsquos K event. Neil Curran was in this race as was Mackenzie Murray, running in the Junior B.Mackenzie was delighted with his race and felt that he was able to control his pace well. The super fast start can be disconcerting and it is hard to judge yourself by those around you.He finished as the ninth Junior B boy in a time of .. A promising run all round. Neil Curran was home in ., which was a  second PB for him at this distance. Despite improving on his time, he was non-committal about his performance, feeling that a lack of speed work had left his legs wanting.Runners can be hard on themselves and should remember that performances that they think lack sparkle, may be times that others may only dream of achieving.Jimmyrsquos recceA call had gone out to our members to take part in a recce of the course for the rapidly approaching Jimmyrsquos .It was decided to open this up to all comers and it was a popular move. With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

This film is her fight to understand the events that shaped her le, in order to move on.The storyline has some parallels with her own le as before her family moved to New York, her father was sentenced to six years in the former Long Kesh prison after being arrested in  on suspicion of carrying a weapon.Apart from writing and filming The Shore at Killough, which was produced by Oorlagh, Terry early earned his film-making credentials as the screenwriter for the film, In the Name of the Father , based on the story of the Guildford Four and wrote the screenplay and directed Some Motherrsquos Son .He has since gone on to write other major films such as The Promise in .While Oolagh worked alongside her father in some of his productions, she has branched out on her own and is currently developing a television drama called Faultline, which she co-created with The Wire writer, Edward Burns.It took six years for Oorlagh Georgersquos screen play of Stranger with a Camera to make it into production. The project has been developed through Sundance Institutersquos Screenwriting and Directing Labs.Oorlagh is producing the film with Mary Ann Marino , Molly Egan , and John Wallace .The film is supported by Sundance Institute, Northern Ireland Screen and Screen Ireland, with additional grant support by The Utah Film Centre and Artemis Rising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Schoolchildren.jpg","title":"Schoolchildren name social housing scheme in Crossgar  ","story":"A NEW social housing scheme in the heart of Crossgar has been officially named.Work on a scheme by Clanmil Housing to build  homes on a former derelict site in Downpatrick Street is nearing completion and has been named Everogue Lane.Housing officials approached Glasswater Primary School and Cedar Integrated Primary School to ask pupils to take part in a competition to name the new development by coming up with an imaginative name that would reflect the sitersquos surroundings or some other interesting aspect of the local area.A total of  entries were received from P pupils at the two schools, the most imaginative of which were submitted to Newry, Mourne and Down Council to select the winning name.The developmentrsquos new name reflects the original name for the village, Everogues Bridge, before it became known as Crossgar, with the winning name a combination of ideas from former Glasswater pupil Grace Chapman and Gabriel Gormley, a former pupil at Cedar.Clanmilrsquos community cohesion officer, Philip Whyte, presented Grace and Gabriel with Amazon Fire tablets in recognition of their creativity.ldquoWe are delighted by the interest that the children have shown in our development and very impressed by the standard and range of names suggested, he said.ldquo Well done to everyone who got involved and thank you to the schools for helping with the competition.ldquoCongratulations to Gabriel and Grace who have together come up with the perfect name for the scheme.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out.

Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple.

He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

Hardly a surprise, of course, for a party that prioritises ‘A Nation Once Again’ above and beyond all .Hence my question, what purpose does she think is served by the Assembly  In the event that a border poll delivered the result she wanted then both Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Assembly would cease to exist. She hopes that will happen as soon as . That being the case what incentive is there for her to lay down a framework for genuine cooperation between unionism and republicanism here.Mary Lou McDonald hopes for a border poll by , then one every seven years until she gets the result she wants \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Indeed, what incentive is there for unionism – even the ‘moderate’ elements – to lay down a framework for genuine cooperation when it, too, knows that Sinn Fein has no long-termin the existence of either the Assembly or Northern Ireland  And evena border poll in the next few years failed to deliver for her, I can’t imagine Sinn Fein would interpret the result as a mandate to start prioritising a successful, ing, genuinely power-sharing Assembly.McDonald would, obviously, point the finger of blame at the DUP, citing the contents of Martin McGuinness’s resignation letter in January : ‘The equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP. Apart from the negative attitude to nationalism and to the Irish identity and culture, there has been a shameful disrespect towards many other sections of our community. Women, the LGBT community and ethnic minorities have all felt this prejudice. And for those who wish to love their lives through the medium of Irish, elements of the DUPhave exhibited the most crude and crass bigotry.’Yet the DUPcould just as easily point the finger at Sinn Fein, citing the tendency of McDonald and other senior figures to commemorate and celebrate the lives of IRA members the tendency of some Sinn Fein to shout ‘Up the Ra’ or ‘Tiocfaidh ár lá’ on any and every occasion and, as stated in a paramilitary assessment report in  and referenced again in the last couple of weeks, the IRA Army Council still exists and ‘oversees both PIRA and Sinn Fein with an overarching strategy’. Indeed, at the end of January Conor Murphy did nothing to deny the conclusions of the report, merely saying: “If there was a crisis tomorrow morning, I don’t doubt we would draft in a team to try to manage our response to it. The team would involve a range of people including elected and non-elected representatives.”Shortly before that report was published the UUP had already withdrawn from the Executive , with then UUP leader Mike Nesbitt confirming: “We are walking out of the Executive because we cannot sit with Sinn Fein because we do not trust them.”Responding to the Army Council’s ongoing influence when the report was publishedhe noted: ‘This blows a hole in SF’s argument. They demand we respect their political mandate, but they now need to make clear the extent to which that mandate is shaped by a group ofunnamed shadowy figures who in the past have overseen the most lethal terrorist force on the planet.” I’m not entirely sure what has happened in the meantime to convince the UUP that ato the Executive was justied.Anyway, at the heart of the present relationship between unionism and republicanismis a deep, ever-widening lake of toxicity. Whatever Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill may say in public about the willingness to work together and to cooperate for the good of Northern Ireland, the inescapable, unavoidable fact remains that genuine cooperation is not possible between them. They rejoined the Executive for mutually contradictory reasons a month ago and they remain in it for mutually contradictory reasons.In the run-up to Northern Ireland’s centenary in , Foster will push something which she describes as a ‘New Generation Unionism’ project, while Sinn Feinwill turbo-charge its longstanding ‘unity project’. As I say, those projects are mutually contradictory and being mutually contradictory makes it impossible for both parties to meet in the middle. Which is why they aren’t even trying.So – and the question now applies to both Sinn Fein and the DUP – what purpose is served by a rebooted Assembly  It gave the DUP a ‘position of influence’ to replace the one it lost in Westminster in December. Sinn Fein wanted to be able to signal to a broader electorate in the Republic that it is capable of a coalition with the most unlikely partners. That’s why both rushed back when Julian Smithoffered them a route back to the Executive. But again, when you’re not actually in the same place for the same reason, let alone the same political purpose, I’ve no idea how anything resembling progress and mutually beneficial cooperation can emerge. Worryingly, that ‘deep, dark and unpleasant place’ I wrote about two weeks ago seems uncomfortably close.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-jeCdPy bGQlOq\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-hgHYgh jDtWHP\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-jeCdPy bGQlOq\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-hgHYgh jDtWHP\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-lhVmIH sc-bYSBpT cqvPrG\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rome.The minister added that there were no changes to travel advice about going to Italy but those ing and showing symptoms should self-isolate.He added: ldquoIn terms of going to Italy as a whole we havenrsquot changed that travel advice.ldquoBut we are clear that,you come back from northern Italy and you have symptoms, then you should self-isolate.Stigma can:# Drive people to hide the illness to

spread of the virus around the world is not yet at pandemic stage, it has the potential to become one.But Mr Hancock said the UK has done a ldquohuge amount of work preparing in case coronavirus became a pandemic, including setting up testing facilities outside AEs and preparing home testing kits.He added: ldquoSince the outbreak became public at the start of this year, we have been doing a

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
