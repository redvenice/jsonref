Now the 18th-century poem is set to be reimagined, in a daily online reading by stars from Marianne Faithfull to Iggy Pop, Jeremy Irons and Tilda Swinton for a world audience in lockdown.The Ancient Mariner Big Read, which launches on Saturday and was commissioned by The Arts Institute at Plymouth University, will see the 150-verse poem ided into 40 readings, with readers from Faithfull to Irons each recording three or four verses to be broadcast daily for free. (Faithfull recorded it before being hospitalised with the coronavirus.) The project will combine the readings with works from major artists including Marina Abramović, and refocus on the poem’s “urgent ecological message”.“We had no idea that we would be pulling this together as all of this happened,” said co-curator Philip Hoare, author of Leviathan or, The Whale, winner of the 2009 Samuel Johnson prize. But Hoare said that the Ancient Mariner Big Read would offer “a brand-new digital work of art to be experienced at home – in a wild voyage into the unknown and watery world”.Coleridge’s poem opens as the Ancient Mariner collars a reluctant Wedding Guest and begins telling him about a disastrous sea voyage. After the Mariner kills an albatross, his ship becomes becalmed. As Coleridge writes, in some of the most famous lines in poetry, the vessel lies “as idle as a painted ship  Upon a painted ocean”, with “Water, water, every where,  Nor any drop to drink.”The Mariner is forced to wear the albatross around his neck, and is the only survivor when the ship is visited by a boat bearing Death, prompting his famous cry: “Alone, alone, all, all alone,  Alone on a wide wide sea!” – a section which is taken on, dramatically, by Faithfull for the Big Read.“It’s the first modern work of literature to address the idea of isolation, in the most intense and visceral and scary, but yet strangely uplifting way,” said Hoare. “The Mariner’s cri de cœur of ‘alone, alone’ is part of us now.”The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is “a founding fable of our modern age”, he said. “We are the wedding guests, and the albatross around the Mariner’s neck is an emblem of human despair and our abuse of the natural world. Yet in its beautiful terror there lies a wondrous solution: that we might wake up and find ourselves saved.”Hoare is curating the project with artist Angela Cockayne and Sarah Chapman, director of the Arts Institute. The three previously worked together on the Moby-Dick Big Read, which saw figures including David Cameron and Stephen Fry join forces to read the entire novel aloud. It has gathered more 10m hits since first being broadcast in 2013.Other contributors to the Coleridge read will include Hilary Mantel and Lemn Sissay, each chosen because they have a backstory that reacts with the poem, said Hoare.Iggy Pop, for example, delivered a “roaring, graphic, growling” reading: “He is the modern Ancient Mariner. He even looks like he’s been on a raft in the Pacific for six months. And he brings his own story – let’s face it, he had his own drug issues, as Coleridge did.” More major names will be revealed as the project progresses.The readings will be accompanied with work by artists including Yinka Shonibare, and paired with relevant scientific research in fields including marine science and climate breakdown. Once the poem is complete, it will be accompanied by a soundscape from electronic musician Jay Auborn, featuring field recordings of albatrosses and creaking ice from the Antarctic.“Although written 200 years ago, the Mariner is more pertinent than ever, forewarning us at our own peril about the abuse of nature, and how we are all interconnected,” said Cockayne, a lecturer at Bath Spa University.She pointed to the “prophetic but eternally hopeful” ending to the poem, later used in the well-known hymn, in which the Mariner advises the Wedding Guest: “He prayeth well, who loveth well  Both man and bird and beast.  He prayeth best, who loveth best  All things both great and small.”“This contemporary voyage draws together a talented interdisciplinary crew, working in film, photography, drawing, painting, and sculpture,” said Cockayne. “The outcome is breathtaking, a circular journey of loss, grief and retribution but also one of hope for our troubled times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8afe603694c3c9e7d47cda998bce2346c97168d5/0_360_5398_3239/master/5398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20bbea68526c4d2ecf1e5bcfa0c362cc","title":"at least seven debenhams stores close loss 400 jobs","story":"Department store chain to close outlets in Salisbury, Westfield in west London and elsewhereAt least seven Debenhams department stores will not reopen after the high street lockdown eases, resulting in the loss of more than 400 jobs.The department store, which collapsed into administration last week, is understood to be exiting the seven stores, including in Salisbury, Westfield in west London, Leamington Spa, and South Shields, as it has been unable to reach agreement with landlords.Deals have been struck regarding 120 of the chain’s 142 sites, which leaves the future of a further 15 outlets hanging in the balance.All Debenhams’ stores closed temporarily on 23 March along with most of the rest of the high street after the government ordered a lockdown on non-essential retail in order to control the spread of coronavirus.The shutdown has prompted fears that thousands of stores will never reopen as many already weak retail firms – which had been suffering from rising costs, the switch to online shopping and weak consumer confidence – struggle to cope with the loss of high street trade.Major names including Oasis, Warehouse and Laura Ashley have already called in administrators and other chains are expected to follow suit.Debenhams, which has fallen into administration for the second time in a year, had already closed 22 stores as part of an attempt to rescue the business by its new owners, who are led by the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree. A further 28 were expected to close next year but it is clear those plans have been accelerated.Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, who is continuing to run the business in administration, said: “We have agreed terms on the vast majority of our UK stores and talks are proceeding positively on the remainder, positioning us to reopen these stores when government regulations permit.“Regrettably we have been unable to reach agreement on seven stores and these will not be reopening, and I’d like to express my thanks to our colleagues in these stores at what I know is a difficult time for everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385178f2e5c6a15ee244fb5e4fb192dcf47709af/15_151_5107_3064/master/5107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc389d5090c2935ea4a7dad9d0f4cc75","title":"bank of england tells lenders to get on with covid 19 business loans","story":"Governor Andrew Bailey says ‘livelihoods are at stake’ as figures show only £1.1bn lent to small firmsThe Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has told Britain’s high street lenders that they must “put their backs into” providing loans for companies affected by Covid-19 amid evidence that many will fail without urgent help.Bailey said commercial banks were under no illusion that “they had to get on with this” to prevent long-term scarring of the economy as a result of the pandemic.Speaking at a virtual press conference, Bailey said banks were operating under difficult conditions but added: “Notwithstanding the stress they are under, they have got to put their backs into it and get on with this. They have to get on and process this stuff because livelihoods are at stake.”“The chancellor needs to make that decision because the public purse is at risk,” Bailey said.Figures from the US suggest that American banks have been much quicker than those in the UK to provide loans to small companies to help them through the lockdown. Bailey said he was not acquainted with the US system, but said: “This is an issue that has to be tackled.”The Bank is currently working on its forecasts for the economy ahead of the publication of its next quarterly monetary policy report in early May – the first since the spread of Covid-19 to the UK closed down large parts of the economy.The governor was cautious, however, about the OBR’s assumption that activity would return to its pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of the year. Bailey said that would depend on the level of business failures and whether the government’s furlough scheme led to much higher unemployment.The International Monetary Fund said earlier this week that global financial stability could be put at risk by the deepest recession since the 1930s, but Bailey said the UK’s financial system was robust enough to withstand the pressure. The Bank’s stress tests had not factored in Sunak’s decision to support the economy through higher public spending, wage subsidies and loan guarantees.Bailey said the government was having no trouble raising the money from the financial markets to cover its sharply increased borrowing, adding that Sunak had yet to draw on a government overdraft facility at the Bank of England, which was announced last week.But he made clear that the Bank was keeping a close eye on the long-term implications of the additional debt being accumulated by the government, businesses and households. “We have to watch that very carefully,” Bailey said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47e0c1fe593617e18d14a33d0b1a319e8e6aad7/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247856ced2d26f38da3a8ef5e495f0f7","title":"ey ordered pay whistleblower 11m dubai gold audit case","story":"Court rules accountancy firm breached code of ethics in its dealings with a refinerA former partner at the accounting firm EY has been awarded $10.8m (£8.6m) in damages after being forced out of his job when he exposed professional misconduct during an audit of a Dubai gold refiner.The high court in London ruled on Friday that EY had repeatedly breached the code of ethics for professional accountants in its dealings with one of its clients, Kaloti Jewellery International.The claim was brought by Amjad Rihan, who revealed that silver-coated gold had been shipped from Morocco to avoid export restrictions and precious metal obtained from other countries such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iran without due diligence.After telling EY about his concerns, Rihan was ordered back to Dubai but feared for his and his family’s safety. He resigned and subsequently made whistleblowing disclosures in 2014.Mr Justice Kerr found EY had breached its duty to Rihan through failing to perform the Kaloti audit in an ethical and professional manner.The court awarded Rihan a total of $10,843,941 and £117,950 in sterling for damages for past and future loss of earnings, and loss of employment benefits.After the ruling, Rihan said: “Almost seven years of agony for me and my family has come to an end with a total vindication by the court. My life was turned upside down as I was cruelly and harshly punished for insisting on doing my job ethically, professionally and lawfully in relation to the gold audits in Dubai.“The court ruled in my favour and found that EY breached its duties towards me, for which I am very grateful. I hope that EY uses this judgment as an opportunity to improve and take the necessary measures to avoid anything like this ever happening again.”Paul Dowling, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day who represented Rihan, said: “For years EY has refused to admit any wrongdoing in relation to the Kaloti audit. Instead it accused Mr Rihan of being a liar and a fantasist. Our client’s character and actions have now been completely vindicated by the court.“By contrast it is EY which has been found to have committed serious professional misconduct at the highest echelons of the organisation. This important judgment sends a clear message to would-be whistleblowers that they do not have to tolerate unethical conduct within their organisation, no matter how high up the chain it goes.In his judgment, Kerr said: “Gold is used in the banking industry, for investment purposes in the jewellery industry and in the electronics industry, for manufacturing. It is recognised internationally as being among the ‘conflict minerals’ attractive to criminals and terrorists because it is relatively easy to move and holds its value well.“For these reasons, the importance of good due diligence and regulation in the gold refining industry and other ‘conflict minerals’ trading is emphasised in guidance published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in US legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Act. The claimant and his colleagues at EY Dubai and EY MENA saw this as an opportunity to acquire fruitful work producing assurance reporting to gold refiners in Dubai and elsewhere in the region. Kaloti was the most substantial of the Dubai refiners, with the largest market share.”Commenting on the Morocco transactions, Kerr said: “I accept as a fact that the defendants were responsible for suggesting to Kaloti that it should draft its compliance report in a manner that masked the reality of the Morocco gold issue, removing the reference to Morocco and changing the coating of gold bars with silver to documentary irregularities. I regard this as professional misconduct.”An EY spokesperson said: “We are surprised and disappointed by the judge’s decision, its introduction of an unprecedented legal duty and its financial award to a former EY Dubai partner. We will appeal and, therefore, not comment in detail. It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities. Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74cebb15d749afec57f96b61807fd12a7cc7f008/0_163_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b92fbc899fed274f3cce184be8dc472","title":"suppliers ration stocks tinned tomatoes after surge demand","story":"Supermarkets and convenience store groups are understood to be jockeying for supplies as families continue to buy more tinned foods than usual after the closure of schools and restaurants forced them to cook more meals at home.While all tinned food sales have surged, suppliers and retailers said demand for tomatoes had outstripped that for beans, soup and tinned fish or vegetables, leaving suppliers concerned about stocks running low.David McDiarmid, a director of Princes Group, which owns the Napolina brand, confirmed it was allocating stock to its clients to ensure it could “fairly and equitably share” what is available and prevent stocks running out before the new season begins in June.Italian tomatoes make up about three-quarters of UK stocks, according to the Grocer trade journal, and are canned between June and September.Diego Pariotti, the head of export at Conserve Italia, which owns the Cirio tinned tomato brand, said it could meet usual order levels but not “crazy demand”. He added they had told customers: “If you don’t start calming the fever we won’t get to the next crop.”People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.McDiarmid said: “It’s a seasonal crop. It’s finite. What was picked last year is what was picked and that’s all there is until 2020 harvest. We can’t bring forward the harvest.” He said Napolina’s processing plant in Puglia, Italy, had sent out 72 full trucks on one day alone last month, about four times the normal level, as it tried to keep up with demand from stockpiling families.While demand has since slowed, McDiarmid said staff in Italy had been doing a “Herculean job” trying to meet demand under strict physical distancing rules.Transporting product to the UK has also been more difficult and expensive as suppliers have had to combine sea, rail and road transport to meet demand and deal with hold-ups at border crossings and difficulties in keeping drivers safe.Supermarkets said they were confident supplies would not run out because they were turning to alternative brands and own-label products. But they confirmed there was competition over access to product between different chains.As prices are usually set in June for the year ahead, the price of tomatoes has not gone up but suppliers’ profit margins have been squeezed by additional costs and it is likely that prices will rise for the year ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16d0a4579e9df28986d8a49e4b7c0084222ce4f/0_84_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f29f4e2cfbcb330796ec6a26b6da65e","title":"us airlines empty planes coronavirus environment","story":"The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air.Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.“The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.”This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people.However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.“You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.”The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.“The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.” A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”."},{"url":null,"title":"have you been affected coronavirus anywhere but westminster","story":"For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you As the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.Do you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

It needs disruptingAt Amazon, it’s always “day one”. Founder Jeff Bezos coined the phrase in the company’s early days, and it’s now deeply woven into the firm’s culture: it has appeared in every shareholder letter since 1997, and even adorns the building in which Bezos works. As tech reporter Alex Kantrowitz writes, “day one” means “inventing like a startup” – a call for continual improvement and innovation. Dynamism is in complacency is out. For Bezos, “day two” is another name for death.However, it’s not always wise to take corporate self-description at face value. Still, given the staggering speed and scale of Amazon’s growth, it’s reasonable to think that its “day one” mentality has had something to do with its success. Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalisation of just over $1tn at time of writing.But despite the outward success, Amazon’s embrace of ceaseless invention has come at a cost. In the absence of a strong ethical code, the ruthlessness that makes Amazon so successful for its shareholders can become indistinguishable from cruelty toward those who are not counted in its success metrics. Amazon itself may be flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic, but not all Amazonians are benefiting equally.As customers turn to delivery services such as Amazon out of fear of contracting the virus, the risks appear to have merely been shifted on to workers. A warehouse worker in New York state organised a walkout last month to protest what he alleged were the company’s inadequate safety measures, including its lack of paid sick leave, and was fired a leaked memo indicated that Amazon’s general counsel wanted to depict him as “not smart or articulate” in their PR strategy (the executive who made this remark later published a statement that read “I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me”).Amazon’s poor treatment of its frontline workers – both during this crisis and beforehand – illustrates the dark side of the “day one” mentality. Amazon’s constant push to improve productivity may serve shareholders, but it also results in working conditions so physically taxing that warehouses are stocking vending machines with pain medication, in a tacit acknowledgement of the physical toll. For Amazon, collateral damage appears irrelevant as long as there’s a steady flow of workers walking through the doors every morning.That Amazon is evidently not accountable to its workers should raise the question of who Amazon is accountable to. The more Bezos’s empire embeds itself into the infrastructure of our lives, the more important it becomes to question its motives. In the midst of a crisis with an easily identifiable villain – the virus – Amazon has an opportunity to recast itself as corporate saviour for our times, the company that kept everyone stocked with necessary supplies, even when they couldn’t leave their houses. As other services have slowed or ground to a halt, Prime deliveries are one of the few continuities from the world we’re leaving behind. But make no mistake – Amazon is not merely a benevolent or charitable force, akin to the Red Cross. It is, after all, a commercial company, and its ownership structure is absurdly out of sync with the map of who’s affected by it.As this pandemic makes the world more dependent on Amazon, it’s useful to remember who is actually doing the day-to-day work that keeps the company running. It’s not Jeff Bezos making the deliveries or packing the boxes, after all. For that, we should thank the frontline workers, who are underpaid, overworked and often putting themselves at risk.The coronavirus crisis has essentially functioned as a stress test of our entire socioeconomic order, inadvertently shining a harsh light on all the ways people are being failed by this system. The result could be massive upheaval. In the US, unemployment rates are higher than they’ve been in eight decades millions of renters are skipping their rent payments policies that would have been considered anathema before the crisis are being seriously debated. The structure can be changed – indeed, once we emerge from this crisis, we may find that it will have already changed. Our political imaginations will need to be updated to reflect this new reality.The more Amazon effectively functions as a utility, the more we should be thinking about how to treat it that way. There are many avenues that could be explored: stronger anti-trust legislation something akin to nationalisation breaking it up into separate companies stronger labour protections increased worker control. Rather than an Amazon that sacrifices workers on the altar of shareholder value, we could have an Amazon that balances the needs of all relevant stakeholders.These suggestions might sound impossibly radical, not least because those currently in charge are unlikely to support measures to decrease their wealth and power. But maybe we can borrow a page from Amazon’s book to frame this discussion in a new way. After all, there’s something quite appealing in the idea of “day one”, with its connotations of disruption and reinvention. It’s just a pity that Amazon has directed that energy exclusively towards maximising shareholder value.Imagine instead, if that “day one” spirit were directed toward the socioeconomic system that subordinated these workers in the first place, such that the fruits of their labour were shared more equitably. Day two might not be that terrifying after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3397d35dac6f8f47ada20b3bc47578c137e86f9e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83f4aef495da43ef6f7951b7a072f0e1","title":"political imagination end lockdown mass testing contact tracing","story":"The methods – whether it’s mass testing or contact-tracing – matter less than the huge shift in thinking that is requiredSometimes you’re just asking the wrong question. On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: when will the lockdown end? But that’s the wrong question.Imagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they’re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn’t simply be asking “When?” They would be asking “When will it be safe?” which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn’t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won’t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we’ve ventured out?We should be clear on one thing. Impatience to see an end to this mass, global quarantine is understandable. It’s not just boredom or lack of stamina that prompts it. There are people struggling to put food on the table there are people whose mental health is faltering there are people for whom a day stuck at home is a day stuck with a domestic abuser. For them lockdown is a jail sentence and they need it to end. So of course it makes sense to long for an exit strategy. But it has to begin with an understanding of what lockdown is and what it is not. It’s tempting to see it as a solution: everyone stays at home, we “flatten the curve” and then, slowly and gradually, we lift the restrictions and return to normal. But that’s not how it is. Instead, lockdown is merely the crudest, bluntest instrument we could reach for when the coronavirus first struck. Its primary objective was to keep the number of people infected sufficiently low that the health service could cope. Judged by that standard, preventing, say, the NHS in Britain being overwhelmed, it has succeeded.Read the expert plans, and they all come back to one thing. Sure, social distancing will have to endure, in one form or other, but the key will be the one identified by the World Health Organization at the start: testing, testing, testing.And yet here, too, there is a misconception, and it is one of scale. So far, testing has been limited to those with symptoms and in hospital. But the Nobel laureate Paul Romer – admittedly his prize was for economics rather than epidemiology – has got a lot of attention for a plan that argues that for the economy, and human life, to return to anything like normality, testing will need to be conducted for millions of people, all the time. He imagines health workers being tested at the start of a shift the same would go for care workers, pharmacists, police officers and bus drivers. You might add teachers and restaurant workers. Romer wouldn’t bother testing people who already have symptoms: they should be presumed positive and immediately self-isolate. It’s the “asymptomatic spreaders” you need to identify, stopping them in their tracks. The logic underpinning the plan is clear: there will be no point in reopening shops, pubs and restaurants if people feel too scared to visit them. As virologist Prof Nicolas Locker puts it, “You can’t lift the lockdown as long as you are not testing massively.”Do the maths and the numbers are colossal: Romer estimates some 22m tests would be necessary every day in the US alone, the equivalent of testing every American once every two weeks. Consider that there’s still no sign that Matt Hancock will reach his goal of 100,000 tests a day in the UK, and you realise how many orders of magnitude stand between where we are now and where we would need to be. The obstacles are huge and obvious, though Romer reckons he has answers for all of them. Shortage of swabs? Move to saliva tests instead. Shortage of the key chemicals known as “reagents”? The test kits that rely on them are not the only option. The sheer numbers of tests that would have to be produced? The world’s manufacturers could do it it just requires the political will. Which, given that our lives depend on it, should be there.If that seems daunting, there is another approach. It would still require testing – though not on the same scale – followed by contact tracing: finding all those who’d been in close proximity to someone who’d tested positive and isolating them. “Test, trace, isolate” also has logic on its side, but it, too, takes lots of money and people. It’s thought one contact-tracer is  required for every four cases of infection.That means using the hiatus of lockdown to recruit and train people now in the mechanics of contact tracing. With no leadership from the top – on Thursday Donald Trump effectively announced that the buck stops with the 50 states – the likes of Massachusetts are already assembling their own squads of contact-tracers. San Francisco is doing the same, deploying a combination of librarians and medical students. The UK government could follow their lead immediately, putting to work some of the thousands of people currently at home and itching to help. Tech can play a role, too: note this week’s announcement that Apple and Google will join forces to see if they can produce the app that will make tracing easier and faster, though the threat to privacy of such surveillance is obvious.What specific methods are deployed matter less than the bigger shift that is required, which is one of imagination. Governments need to realise that what’s coming is not a decision about easing this or that rule of social distancing, but rather a massive political, industrial and collective drive unseen since the last war. It may well mean repurposing factories to mass-produce testing kits. At the very least, it should mean a dedicated cabinet minister for testing.This demands a huge shift by the UK government, which wasn’t even testing people coming out of hospital and going into social care until this week. But nothing less will be enough. It’s not enough to flatten the curve we have to get ahead of it. It’s true that we cannot stay in lockdown for ever. But we cannot leave until it’s safe – and that requires a monumental effort, starting right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26fe6c7f86b889d385b35f1ffbd05df5035a60cd/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea6e1c8da508881fb1f77af29054619","title":"british workers reject fruit picking jobs as romanians flown in coronavirus","story":"Contract length, farm location and caring duties cited as reasons for turning down workThousands of British workers who responded to a nationwide appeal to help pick fruit and vegetables on farms have rejected job offers, it has emerged.The Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers said it had received 36,000 applications of interest but only 6,000 had opted for an interview for a role.Concordia, one of the three recruitment companies in the alliance, said: “To date 900 people have explicitly rejected the roles we have offered and 112 have taken up our offer of a role on a UK farm.”It said the main barriers were the length of the contract, location of the farm, and inability to work full-time because of care responsibilities.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“Some are saying they cannot commit to 40 hours a week, some can only commit for a few weeks whereas some roles can be full time for eight weeks and some can be up to six months,” said Sarah Boparan, the operations director at Hops.She said that even though they were not able to hire all who applied, she felt there was an education process under way about farm work that could have a lasting impact after Brexit, when Conservative party plans will put a block on low-paid and low-skilled workers coming to the UK from abroad.“We are so pleased to see so many people apply and so thankful they have responded to the call to support agriculture in this country and we appreciate their patience as some of the crops are not yet ready and new offers will be going out,” she said, adding that peak recruitment would not really start till the end of May for most farms.Several people who said they had responded to the government-backed appeal complained about the barriers to taking up the posts, particularly the on-site accommodation.One man who contacted the , who lives in Norfolk and wanted to commute to a job locally, where there are many farms, said: “Some of the jobs require you to live on-site. It doesn’t make it easy at all. If we really need to be picking all these vegetables, they don’t make it very easy. I can’t move I have a family.”Gary Leshone, 35, who used to work in fishing in Grimsby, launched his own personal recruitment drive when the national Feed the Nation appeal, backed by the environment secretary, George Eustice, was launched three weeks ago.He managed to get 150 volunteers who were willing to cross the country to Herefordshire and to live on-site for six months.“I contacted farmers inidually and initially I was told by one farmer he’d take as many workers as he could get, so I went on radio and social media and got 150 people. I know I could probably find 1,000 to 2,000 here because people are out of work.”He was then told by the farmer that he needed a gangmaster’s licence if he was going to place that many workers on the market, which he was told would take 10 weeks to obtain.“By that time the fruit and veg will have rotted and the borders will probably be reopened,” he said.Underlining the confused messaging surrounding the sudden recruitment drive, Hops pointed out that the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority was doing checks and handing out gangmaster licences within five days because of the crisis.“The Romanians coming in are just like us, looking for work to feed their families themselves, but if they need 90,000 people and you have all these British people unemployed and the government has to pay out universal credit, it’s just ridiculous. The government should do more to sort this out,” said Leshone.Recruiters appealed for patience among British hopefuls, pointing out that the peak season started from May and there would be “thousands of roles available for people who are in need of a job”.There was controversy in Romania after photographs emerged of crowds gathering in regional airports for flights to Germany, which, like the UK, is also suffering a labour deficit. Questions are being asked in Romania as to how workers could leave to help ease other countries’ demand for fresh food when much of Romania is in strict lockdown.G’s Fresh, one of the UK’s biggest salad growers, which has chartered two of the six planes from Bucharest, said it had recruited 500 British workers so far.“We’re really pleased with how the recruitment campaign is going, but it is important that we have got these people from Romania. These are key skilled workers who were with us last year. We need experienced people who can make sure everyone is safe and knows what to do,” Beverley Dixon, the company’s HR director, told Eastern Daily Press.Romanian workers travelling to the UK were given masks and sanitiser before boarding and would be be quarantined in small teams before full deployment, G’s Fresh said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44094542883af78d1ab326a0cd18544f8711bf7/0_101_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e790f2bfd93e1fae59b8a79741da1347","title":"falconers to be allowed to take wild peregrine chicks from nests","story":"UK wildlife watchdog under fire as conservationists say decision ‘sends wrong message’Conservationists have condemned the decision to allow falconers to take wild peregrine falcon chicks from nests as “selfish” and “sending the wrong message”.For the first time ever this year, Natural England, the government’s wildlife watchdog, will allow the taking of six chicks from peregrine nests to help falconers establish a lucrative new “studbook” of British falcons.Peregrine falcons – the fastest species on the planet, reaching more than 200mph during es for prey – were threatened with extinction as a breeding bird in the 1970s. Numbers have recovered to 826 breeding pairs in England, with many nesting on cathedrals and tall buildings in cities, where they are free from persecution.The RSPB said it was “urgently” seeking answers from Natural England about how it made its decision and feared the licence could “open the door” to more applications.Mark Thomas, the RSPB’s head of investigations, said: “The cultural value of these birds is that they are free, wild and available to all. The application will therefore be regarded by many as selfish – it should be reconsidered in light of alternative solutions, and in the context that peregrines suffer from illegal persecution, trade and loss of breeding range.”While all nesting birds are legally protected, licensing the removal of chicks for falconry is permitted under wildlife laws. Falconers argue that their current captive birds are not verifiably British birds and EU regulations permit the sustainable use of species for cultural purposes.Unesco recognises falconry as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity” and the ancient practice is increasingly lucrative, with birds changing hands for as much as £6,000 to supply the sport of falcon-racing in the Middle East. Three falconers will remove chicks from nests in England, although they will not be allowed to do so in parts of northern England where the peregrine is still threatened.Natural England said its licence would only allow a chick to be taken from a nest where there were three or more chicks present. The falconers must only take the smallest, weakest chick, which would not ordinarily survive in the wild. It said it would be “closely monitoring the operation” and could revoke the two-year licence at any time.One falconer behind the attempt to establish a captive population of indisputably British birds, Gary Wing, told Mark Avery’s blog that there was “no commercial interest” in the scheme, which would be costly for falconers to establish.Until the introduction of DNA testing of captive birds in the 1990s, peregrines were regularly and illegally taken from the wild.David Lindo, a conservationist known as “the urban birder”, said he was dismayed at the decision.“It sends the wrong message,” he said. “We’ve got enough birds in captivity. If you’re going to be doing falconry, use the birds in captivity. What is wrong with them? Someone is making money from this somewhere along the line – what sort of message does this send around Europe and the Middle East? It validates the idea that the peregrine is not a species in decline and we can take some more from the wild.”Jade Emery, wildlife campaigner for Animal Aid, said it was “a huge step backwards” for wild bird protection.She said: “While Natural England attempt to dignify falconry by describing it as ‘an ancient tradition’, it is in fact just outdated. Taking animals from the wild and subjugating them for entertainment or sport is fundamentally wrong, should be consigned to history, and is certainly not something that should be supported by Natural England. The wellbeing of these majestic birds should be prioritised over this outdated and cruel hobby, and this decision should be quickly reversed.”Dr Gordon Mellor, chairman of falconry organisation the Hawk Board, said: “Falconers across the world have controlled access to wild populations of raptors following the principles of sustainable use. In this respect UK authorities are following established conservation practice.“UK wildlife legislation is predicated upon the need to conserve and protect wild populations. Given that the peregrine population is currently buoyant, the taking of limited numbers will have no impact upon the wellbeing of that species in the wild.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/793d548a22f401fc02018343a7e929bf9aff1edc/0_115_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a58b2b92ca153149a3afb3cae3b7a9","title":"rebuild it shade it breed it three tactics to buy time for the great barrier reef","story":"While emissions reduction is the only long-term solution, scientists are testing ways to keep the reef going in a warming worldCan the world’s greatest coral reef system be rescued from the rapid march of the climate crisis?With global temperatures already about 1C higher than pre-industrial levels, Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef has been through three mass bleaching events in only five years.Corals are dying and the system is changing rapidly as temperatures keep going up and greenhouse gases keep accumulating in the atmosphere.Earlier this week, the Australian government revealed a $150m research and development program to build the reef’s resilience to future warming.Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “It’s a bit like the Apollo 11 mission. It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years’ time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.”On its own, the project – called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program – is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef.It’s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they’re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder.Some 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs.The program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation – it’s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches:So what’s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time?In early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, led a trial of equipment that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air.The idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets.The process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds.Harrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below – perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching.Such a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress.Harrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: “It’s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach.“We are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.”Other methods under this “shading and cooling” category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas.Anyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what’s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre.Coral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore inidual reefs.There are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover.Removing natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation.Modelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales.Anthony says if temperatures stay below 2C “then there is so much we can do” across all the approaches.“It’s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,” he says.“At 3C the reef will look very different – it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn’t give up.”Prof Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons.“It’s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,” he says.One approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in “slicks” and drop them in places that need help to recover.“Because the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.”Harrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs.Corals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae.Combining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs “more scope for growth under warming conditions”.“We are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change. There’s a large group of people around me who feel we can’t wait for action. We have to work out what we can do now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52068e07b03c7d1779ea4ae3da4bc63958fd873a/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c15dcd78d58664ce79fcb2c916391915 2020w","title":"food waste lockdown larders coronavirus food banks","story":"Use-by dates are ignored, while new findings show increasing numbers turning to food banks It is a snapshot of a more abstemious nation, as staying at home and being unable to eat out means Britons are making their food go further and throwing less away.Consumers are rising to the challenge of a “lockdown larder” as a result of the pandemic, and ignoring recommendations on best-before and use-by labels and piling less food on to their plates, new research has revealed.Cooking from scratch, having “virtual” dinner parties online, and eating more family meals together are some of the positive shifts in shopping and cooking behaviour under way in households across the UK since restaurants and pubs closed, according to a survey by the environmental charity Hubbub.Yet the findings also reveal that many are struggling to put meals on the table and are worried about food, with increasing numbers turning to food banks for the first time.Trewin Restorick, chief executive of Hubbub, said: “At what is a deeply troubling time, it’s encouraging to see some really positive changes taking place in households across the country.“Families are eating together more, young people are learning to cook, people are planning meals better and using up leftovers. However, it’s concerning to see some of the downsides of food restrictions impacting on the health of people’s diets and I was horrified by the recent report from the Food Foundation, which showed that 3 million people have gone full days without meals since lockdown started.”Despite the generally positive experience of reconnecting with food, nearly half said they were more worried about food than before and a similar proportion were anxious about the extra cost of putting food on the table.The consumer group Which? advises that while the rules can be bent for some products, those on fresh and processed meat, poultry and fish should not. Anyone classed as vulnerable or with underlying health conditions should also adhere to the dates on the labels. Unlike use-by dates, best-before labels are put on foods as a quality indication to show that though they are no longer at their best they are still safe enough to eat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f7b05bbfb0eca5b9ab923752c2dab3023a4ca5/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ac3c237e575e2b7016e1244550f7432","title":"tom hunts recipe for store cupboard soda bread","story":"How to turn those odds and ends of various bags of flour into a tasty loafMany of us have been ing into our store cupboards to use up all those odds and ends.

The recipe is adaptable, so you can use up any combination of flour. In mine, I used wholemeal, rye, quinoa and buckwheat flours with a dash of oatmeal, which made a satisfying and deeply flavourful, nourishing bread, but even plain white flour will make a wonderful loaf.Soda bread is traditionally made with buttermilk, which is hard to find at the best of times, but it can just as easily be made with water or milk. Random oats, nuts and seeds can also be salvaged to make a rustic, crusty topping.Chefs and food writers love sharing our recipes. We want you to cook and enjoy our food, and be nourished by it, but I sometimes worry that we are not teaching people how to cook, but rather to follow a precise set of instructions using an obscure list of ingredients, and in the process leaving home cooks with all sorts left over that they don’t know how to use up.Maybe instead of writing recipes, we should be writing cooking formulas, techniques and preparations – more flexible recipes that will help people cook with creativity and intuition, using up what’s available?

A new two-year contract signed in March will take the 27-year-old into her 13th year with the club. Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager’s plans.It is a huge vote of confidence for the midfielder, yet the respect of one of the most experienced club managers in the game, two league titles, a Spring Series trophy, two FA Cups and, this year, the team’s first League Cup, have not been enough to earn her a place in Phil Neville’s England squad.Spence admits “the squad is difficult to get in, especially my position, because there’s so many good midfielders in England. It’s tough”. However with defenders such as Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson filling in in midfield and formations tweaked game by game to try to compensate for injuries, the inability of Spence to get a look-in seems odd.“Phil’s not spoken to me once,” says the softly spoken Spence, with no anger but a tinge of disappointment. “To not be given that chance makes me question: ‘Is it because of what happened?’ I think it is because of what happened, if I’m totally honest.”Spence is referring to her involvement in the Mark Sampson racism case. In 2017, when her then Chelsea teammate Eni Aluko spoke to the  about her treatment after taking part in an anonymous questionnaire on the culture within the national team, Spence was pulled into the ring as the unnamed player who, while the only player of colour in the room, had been asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested. Initially Spence stayed quiet before writing to the FA to confirm Aluko’s account of the event.After a very public and messy series of investigations, the FA “sincerely apologised” to both Spence and Aluko. The latter did not play for England again, but with more than 100 caps and the end of her career a bit closer she was aware she had less to lose by speaking out.Spence, who was 25 and had attended only one England camp, under Sampson, stayed quiet in an attempt to protect her position. “The reason I didn’t speak out straight away was because I was worried,” she says. “I was stressed at the time. There was a lot going on behind closed doors. My main concern was whether it would affect me playing for my country. I’m happy with the decision I took – I didn’t speak out then, it wouldn’t have been right.”She has had one call-up since, for the squad’s training camp in La Manga in the immediate aftermath under the interim manager Mo Marley, but she is a little sceptical of the intent behind her selection, speculating over whether it was to make the FA “look good in the media”. The FA said in a statement on Friday that “players are only ever picked on merit and all English players in the WSL are watched and considered for selection”.Reflecting on the situation triggers a little frustration, but for now Spence is relaxed about her international future. Why? Because at Chelsea she has Hayes’s trust and feels valued. “Right now I’m not losing any sleep over it,” she says. “I’ve got a good career at Chelsea, we’re winning titles, we’re challenging every season, so I’m happy with my status at the moment.”Her life at Chelsea is by no means a walk in the park. Staying in Hayes’s plans is tough. She had eight league starts this season – she started 15 games in 2018-19 – before it was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s difficult for me because a lot of people always write me off,” she says. “Every year, I’ve got to push myself. I know there’s going to be signings coming in every year.“Emma’s made that clear every season really, to make sure that the squad is pushing again and pushing to another level. It’s just really believing in myself, making sure I’m doing everything right in training every day and competing with the players that come in.”Hayes’s “honesty” in telling her where she needs to improve, and her willingness to adapt and take it on board, is the secret to her longevity at the club. “Emma can rely on me to be put in wherever she’s needed me,” Spence says. “I’ve played higher and lower. I’ve even played out wide sometimes, which is definitely not my game. Emma always wants a player that can play in different positions so she makes you adapt.”Hayes prides herself on building teams of leaders, of finding the “right players”, and that approach has yielded trophies. Before the season was suspended, Chelsea were one point behind Manchester City with a game in hand and a domestic treble in their sights having lifted the League Cup in February.“Obviously, not being in the Champions League this year was even more frustrating. If we don’t win it in the next two years I feel like it’ll be a massive failure to be honest, because the team we have at the moment can easily win the Champions League. I think everyone knows that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599aadfd4ea23f006661c8e0d82a3d07d9733dd3/0_297_2801_1682/master/2801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3218b15924345422492440696da3225c","title":"premier league could return by mid june in best case scenario football","story":"Premier League clubs have discussed resuming the season on the weekend of 13-14 June after Uefa wrote to domestic associations stating a desire they should finish their competitions by 31 July to leave August clear for the completion of the Champions League and Europa League.The letter from European football’s governing body formed the basis of a two-hour conference call on Friday that explored how the Premier League may be concluded.While any resumption is being modelled on matches occurring behind closed doors, guiding the decision-making is the overriding principle that the National Health Service’s ability to treat those with Covid-19 should not be compromised and that it has to be at ease with the top-flight restarting. This means the Premier League wants the NHS to give the go-ahead and so the health service has power of veto.In the best-case scenario clubs would have a “pre-season” from 10 or 14 May, giving players four weeks to regain fitness, with the minimum they would need set at two weeks. If training began three or four weeks before the weekend of 13 and 14 June, the opening days may feature players training inidually or in small groups to ensure the best protection before squads worked together as normal.Protocols devised by the Premier League and club doctors and signed off by the requisite bodies would have testing at the forefront and would be in place to try to ensure a safe return to games. Those at matches – players, club staff, officials, security and media – would all have to be tested and there would have to be procedures to address the prospect of large groups of fans gathering outside stadiums.Uefa’s wish is that the Champions League and Europa League should each recommence from the week of Monday 3 August with the final of the former being staged on Saturday 29 August and that of the latter to be played a few days before.If the Premier League was to restart on 13 June – a Saturday – it would allow seven weeks to finish the season. As 16 clubs have nine matches left and Manchester City, Sheffield United, Aston Villa and Arsenal have 10, the timeframe would appear to be long enough for the campaign to be finished comfortably.It is understood the Premier League is conscious of a worst-case scenario given the unpredictability of coronavirus and how long it may take to tackle it. The pessimistic view is that no football can resume until October, seven months after the last round of matches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18398193bbc90cc414122b63d3e62dd5c9f93b17/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c4f6f1312c81a5946a5e26e6f776340","title":"resistance fifa futile prepare to be normalised football broadcast rights","story":"There is plenty up for grabs after the collapse of club football’s TV rights power base – and Fifa is ready to grab itNobody wants a visit from the Normalisation Committee. This was the fate of the Samoan FA in June 2008 after concerns were raised about the state of its finances. At which point Fifa fired up the corvette and sent in its platoon of tuxedoed Mr Fix-its.Let’s be clear. Nobody wants a visit from this Normalisation Committee. The team of high moral priests sent to the Samoan FA’s door that day were handpicked by a specially convened Fifa emergency committee, a delegation that read, in no particular order: Sepp Blatter, Jack Warner, Issa Hayatou, Michel Platini, Reynald Temarii, Mohammad bin Hammam and Nicolás Leoz.Or to give them their full Seven Dwarves-style nicknames: Six Year Ban Guy, Criminal Charges Guy, TV Rights Fine Guy, Dishonest Payment Guy, Eight Year Ban Guy, Life Ban Guy and of course everyone’s favourite crime-fighting administrator, Interpol Red Notice Guy. Here they come, the lads: a perfumed kerchief held to their noses, here to de-corrupt your football association.Twelve years on the Samoa emergency committee is arguably one of the best jokes modern football has ever come up with. Just how abnormal do you have to be to require this degree of normalising? But then these were the golden years of footballing chicanery, when the yak-hide handbags flowed like wine and when Fifa could basically do as it wished.The anomaly was that Samoa fought back. In a rare show of resistance the Samoan FA appealed to the court of arbitration for sport. It didn’t work. The appeal was rejected and the good times continued to roll at Fifa house, reaching a peak with the bribe-shadowed World Cup bid decisions that would prove an act of hubris even for that thoroughly debauched regime.And so to the present day. Replace one bald, unctuous Swiss with a slightly younger bald, unctuous Swiss and something similar is happening in the Caribbean, a test case for where we may be heading in the struggle for the heart, soul and wallet of world football.The Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago FA experienced its own visit from the Fifa Normalisers in March after another shemozzle over debt. Like Samoa the TTFA has fought back. Another appeal has been lodged at Cas, this time via crowdfunded legal action.Fifa’s move does seem bizarrely aggressive. The deposed TTFA committee had been in place for only four months, having seen off Gianni Infantino’s favoured candidate David John-Williams in a local vote.The TTFA board member Keith Look Loy has accused Fifa of acting like “a colonial absentee landlord”. The former Newcastle, West Ham and Portsmouth goalkeeper Shaka Hislop has called the intervention “a coup”. In an excellent twist the leader of the ousted rebel FA is even called William Wallace. They can take our lives but they’ll never take … our freebies.Much has been made by the ancien régime of Look Loy and co’s historic association with the disgraced Jack Warner, once of the Samoan Normalisation Committee and now avoiding the US justice system.Asked about rumours he might have lobbied for the Wallace campaign – something Wallace fiercely denies – Warner told the broadcaster Andre Errol Baptiste of Port of Spain-based i95.5fm: “Even if that was the case, and by the way that is not the case, and it means that is the beginning of the way to lift football in the country, so be it. What’s wrong with that?” Which pretty much clears that one up.What is actually happening here? This might feel like a dispute at the edge of things, with plenty that is undesirable on both sides, but Fifa’s actions seem extraordinarily high-handed and patrician, even by its own standards, evidence of the increasing hawkishness of the Infantino regime. As the Norwegian Josimar website has pointed out the man in charge of all this normalisation is even one of Infantino’s best friends, his old university chum Véron Mosengo-Omba.This matters right now. There is a great deal up for grabs a month into the total collapse of club football’s broadcast rights power base. This perhaps explains why Fifa’s public statements during the Covid-19 crisis have been almost alarmingly relaxed. Fifa may suspend all international football. Fifa may, we hear, dig into its £2bn cash fund to bail out clubs and leagues.“Never let a serious crisis go to waste” is an overused line in the current uncertainty but you can bet Infantino has it inked on the back of his hand. Make no mistake Fifa has a great deal to gain at a time when every entity that has tried to resist its power, from Premier League to Uefa to the poor old TTFA, is significantly weakened.The collapse of the Blatter-Warner-Platini era hit Fifa hard but not that hard. Money continued to flow but what Fifa really wants is power, most noticeably in its shadow-struggle with club football, where Infantino is convinced it is Fifa’s destiny to take a stronger role.This seemed to be coming to a head late last year as Florentino Pérez presented a breakaway plan led by the richest clubs to cut out domestic leagues, with Fifa seemingly in close, approving pursuit.Exciting new plans come and go. This one seemed as likely as so many others but Covid-19 has shifted the picture even further. Every league, every club is facing a financial nosee, their power tied inexorably to those freeze-framed TV deals. “Football can – and I believe will – play a big part in helping our world recover,” Infantino mused last week, no doubt pondering the majesty of his organisation’s bank balance and with the next major Fifa payday safely tucked away in late 2022.Nobody really knows what the world will look like once normalisation returns to all of us but some certainties do remain. Resistance, as the case of the TTFA demonstrates, is still futile and right now Fifa is in a position to bend that future to its will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e1433615a5fdb5eaa228722ab5038ef750aabc/0_0_2064_1239/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51de0d80fc5f980612347ab29a3aba7d","title":"how norman hunter became one of leeds uniteds biggest legends","story":"Nicknamed ‘Norman bites yer legs’, the Leeds defender won 28 England caps but had his biggest successes at Elland RoadNorman Hunter had to wait 41 years for his World Cup winners’ medal – as a non-playing member of England’s 1966 squad he was not deemed entitled to one until the rules were eventually revised – yet the Leeds United centre-half’s no-nonsense playing style is as fondly remembered today as any other from the era when televised football turned local heroes into household names.Partly that is to do with the wonderfully apposite nickname that followed him around after the 1972 FA Cup final against Arsenal, when a banner in the Leeds end declaring “Norman bites yer legs” was spotted and commented on by the studio pundit Brian Clough. There was more than a grain of truth in the assertion, though rather than being a menace on the pitch Hunter, whose death at the age of 76 was confirmed on Friday, was simply a brusquely physical defensive presence of a type common at the time.Every team seemed to have a strongman with a memorable and fondly bestowed pet name – Liverpool had Tommy “Anfield Iron” Smith and Chelsea had Ron “Chopper” Harris – and though some of the tackling might be considered hair-raising by modern standards, half a century ago it was just part of the game. In a way Hunter did bite yer legs – opponents had to be good or quick to get past him – but first and foremost he was an excellent defender, not merely the enforcer his sobriquet tends to suggest.Had Hunter not been able to play good football he would have been nowhere near a World Cup final at the age of 22. The reason he was unable to break into the side was because Alf Ramsey had decided Bobby Moore and Jack Charlton formed the best centre-back partnership and neither player became injured or did anything to warrant being replaced. Hunter just had to wait until 1970 but even then he found Everton’s experienced Brian Labone had moved ahead in the queue to play alongside Moore.Hunter did manage to make an appearance in the ill-fated quarter-final against West Germany in Leon. He came on for Martin Peters with nine minutes remaining only to see Uwe Seeler send the game into extra time then Gerd Müller supply the Germany winner.The defender’s luck was no better when he finally managed to break into the England team. He had replaced Moore in the side at long last for the 1973 game against Poland at Wembley that Ramsey’s team needed to win to qualify for the following year’s World Cup but ended up blaming himself for a mistake the visitors capitalised on to take the lead. Though England equalised, the win eluded them and for Ramsey as well as Hunter the World Cup trail came to an abrupt end.While Hunter might have won more than 28 caps had he played at a time when England were not quite as well-equipped with centre-backs, his club career at least was eventful and rewarding. He played 726 times for Leeds after being scouted as a Gateshead schoolboy and signing on at the age of 15, making his debut at 19 and forming a partnership with Charlton that would last a decade.Don Revie’s side were promoted from the Second Division in 1964 and were on course for a league and Cup double in the following season before losing to Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup final and being pipped to the title by Manchester United on goal average.Compensation for those disappointments arrived later in the decade as Leeds built on their success to become the strongest team in the country as the 60s turned into the 70s. Not necessarily the prettiest or best-liked, as Clough as Leeds manager is notoriously supposed to have pointed out, but there was no arguing with the eventual success under Revie, or that Elland Road had become the most daunting stadium for opposing teams.With Hunter a fixture in the side, Leeds won the title in 1969 and 1974, the FA Cup in 1972, and were losing finalists to Sunderland at Wembley a year later. The 1972-73 season also brought defeat in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final by Milan, a match in which Hunter was dismissed for retaliation at the end amid protests from the crowd over the impartiality of a referee who would receive a ban for match-fixing in subsequent games.However that controversy was nothing next to the heated disputes over disallowed goals and non-awarded penalties that disfigured the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern Munich.Franz Beckenbauer’s side won 2-0, though many still feel that Leeds, now being looked after by Jimmy Armfield after Revie had moved on to England, were cheated in Paris. The violent reaction from sections of the Leeds support resulted in the club being banned from European competition for two years, though it never needed to be applied as the great Elland Road years were effectively over.Hunter moved on to Bristol City in 1976. The £40,000 fee was an eye-catching one for a 33-year-old and Hunter played more than 100 games for the Robins before moving back north to end his career with Barnsley. He tried his hand at management when he finished playing at Oakwell, lasting four years after taking over from Allan Clarke, though a later spell at Rotherham was shorter and his last.Inevitably, perhaps, he spent later years as a meeter and greeter back at Elland Road, where he has a banqueting suite named in his honour. Every club should make the most of its legends, after all, and club legends do not come much bigger or bolder than Norman Hunter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e192ed6e05ceaad7ef9358149c921df090e5931f/0_784_3345_2005/master/3345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13b1d35b914bcd36d282bb4817fa2e31","title":"norman hunter a life in pictures","story":"The former Leeds and England defender Norman Hunter has died at the age of 76 after contracting coronavirus.

Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Certainly, I was painfully aware in adolescence of her frustrations with my father (whom she loves dearly) and her grievances against other family members, which caused me huge anxiety.Now that she’s a bit older, a spitefulness has emerged, initially focused on my siblings’ partners as their relationships fell apart. I dread spending time alone with her or having phone calls where she wants me to agree with her criticisms of family and friends.I have tried ignoring the comments, but she is extremely persistent – and at one point stopped talking to me when I pointed out how she was behaving. I want to be supportive, but it is increasingly difficult to trust her, and I avoid meaningful conversation beyond logistics of grandchildren, towards whom my parents are loving and indulgent.I realise I’ve made her sound like a monster when in fact she can be kind and generous and loyal. She is very worried about losing my father, who is kind, gentle and energetic but has health issues. She is a clever, creative person, and this makes it even harder to accept that this nastiness is part of her personality rather than something I can help her overcome. I don’t want their happy lives to end in bitterness.If others think this is a radical change in your mother’s personality, it might be worth getting her checked out by a GP. Your dad would be the right person to ask. But sometimes we get to stages in our lives where we suddenly see our parents anew.I thought your problem was in some ways very normal – I hear a lot of similar stories anecdotally. I think many people, as they age, become more critical, less tolerant and feel more able to voice these thoughts, however negative.I want to stress that neither Shmueli nor I knows if your mother is depressed, but it’s a possibility. “When you’re angry, you don’t have to feel sad,” explained Shmueli, “you don’t have to feel dependent or powerless. You can just be really angry and criticise others, and it can be all their fault. It’s unconscious, but by doing this your mother avoids feeling sad and vulnerable.”In other words, when the truth is too painful to hold within us, we project. So I asked Shmueli what he felt was at the core of your mother’s sadness, and his hunch was that the big issue was your dad’s ill health. You mention it at the end, and yet Shmueli felt it was central to your mother’s anguish: there’s the unspoken sadness hinted at in your last line – that your mother and father’s time is limited. He didn’t think it was a coincidence that her focus was on the ex-partners of your siblings, that is, those who have left.The probable reality is that your mother was always a bit like this, but something is crystallising this aspect of herself. And the catalyst is probably fear of loss and greater dependency. Fear tends to strip away our defences. While your mum is criticising other people, she doesn’t have to look at herself.Ideally your mum would talk to someone about this, but I asked Shmueli how you should react when your mother starts criticising and tries to enlist you. He suggested saying, “I can see you’re upset, Mum, what are you so unhappy about?” It won’t be easy, because this turns the criticism around and exposes her own vulnerability – but it may be a start in helping her.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

One unexpected side-effect of the pandemic has been the enormous increase in viewing among teenagers, potentially signalling the return of families watching TV together.“The way the media market works is on supply and demand,” said Stephen Allan, chief executive of the major media buying agency MediaCom, referring to the enlarged audiences available to advertisers and the fall in the number of companies wanting to buy adverts to reach them. “What broadcast media are facing is a perfect storm, where supply has gone up hugely but demand has gone down.”He said that while some of his clients are talking about increasing their advertising spend when the lockdown ends, he fears channels will run out of new programmes to bring in audiences, as no shows have been made during the lockdown.“Stuff that was being made is not going to be there, in terms of the more typical dramas or sitcoms. So what are they going to show?”These fears are widespread, with popular soaps such as EastEnders and Coronation Street already cutting the number of episodes they screen to try to avoid running out of pre-filmed material.“For at least two years you’re going to see less money on screen,” said Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis, who predicted a severe shortage of scripted dramas. Actors and directors will have committed to filming multiple projects, he said, with schedules that now overlap.Meanwhile, ITV sources confirmed reports that filming of Love Island, one of the channel’s main cashcows, has been delayed until August at the earliest, and could even be filmed in the UK rather than on a Spanish island.And Channel 4 has slashed its programme budget by a quarter to ensure survival, raising fears that the collapse of domestic commissioning budgets will mean less distinctively British television will get made.Newspapers face threat of closure as advertisers fleeThe British newspaper industry is facing an existential threat, with the National Union of Journalists warning many papers will close permanently as a result of the pandemic, and thousands of journalists will lose their jobs.Newspaper websites are seeing record readership levels but little income, as advertisers have slashed budgets or blocked their promotions from appearing alongside coronavirus-related stories. There are also signs that news audiences are starting to decline as people get used to the lockdown.Free websites are often cross-subsidised by print sales, but the model is being hit hard. Although there has been an increase in people using services such as Deliver My Newspaper, national newspaper sales are down by about a fifth, with staff at News UK asked to tweet urging people to buy a paper in an attempt to drive up sales.Streaming and gaming look to fill the gapNetflix has been among the biggest winners, with its soaring share price meaning the company is now worth more than the oil multinational ExxonMobil. However, it is facing its own issues, with production of hit shows such as Sex Education paused owing to the pandemic. YouTube has also enjoyed enormous viewership, but its creators have suffered falls in ad revenue, which is also likely to dent profits at Facebook and Google.Sky and BT Sport have been badly affected by the absence of sport, with many people pausing or cancelling their subscriptions – but there are growth areas. Viewers have turned to gaming, with popular consoles such as the Nintendo Switch sold out in many stores.Cinema releases have been upendedThe global film release schedule has been upended by the pandemic, with cinemas closed for the foreseeable future and films stacking up as they miss their release dates.The UK cinema industry is likely to lose £400m in ticket sales as 52 million cinema-goers stay at home, based on equivalent figures from 2019. Industry chiefs hope audiences will return to see delayed blockbusters such as Wonder Woman 1984, the latest James Bond, No Time to Die, and Mulan. However even when the lockdown is lifted, consumers might take a while to be comfortable squeezing into cinema seats next to strangers.Some films are opting to go down the modern equivalent of the direct-to-video route, with Trolls World Tour, a children’s film, made available on streaming services after its cinema release was cancelled. Other films, such as Keira Knightley’s Misbehaviour, which was released in cinemas just days before the lockdown, have been rush-released for download.The BBC hopes it has saved itselfAt the start of the year the BBC was under attack from all sides, and the licence fee could yet be decriminalised. But after attracting plaudits from ministers for its role in a crisis, and with its stable source of funding not affected by the advertising collapse, it has a chance to prove its value."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7adb6d1338ef86586badc72aa1f78bb4601fa0d/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee15e33bc52df244344109b1b188665 480w","title":"international space station crew return to earth","story":"American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space StationThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio’s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of the morning.Morgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.The trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by a recovery crew wearing face masks and rubber gloves, who pulled them out of their landing capsule. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.“Please keep your distance,” one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia’s space agency.Following the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US. A closer airport has been closed to international flights due to the coronavirus. “It’s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we’re truly going back to a different planet,” Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.“We were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren’t.”Isolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.On Thursday, Russian officials reported the first case of coronavirus at Star City, the complex outside Moscow which serves as the control room and training hub for space flights. The director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said on Wednesday that there were currently 30 cases of coronavirus among employees.Even minor illnesses can be disastrous in space, with the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 severely hampered when one of those on board developed a cold soon after blastoff and quickly passed it to the others. For this reason, crews undergo a rigorous quarantine procedure for a month prior to departure.Due to coronavirus, these procedures were made even stricter than usual for the new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.Astronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS. Before blastoff, Cassidy said part of him was pleased to be leaving Earth at the most uncertain time in a generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

Cam Newton and Marcus Mariota have a chance to take the crown whenever football season kicks offWe’ve seen it a bunch of times: a second-contract quarterback who due to their own averageness or organizational incompetence is dumped from one team then experiences a Renaissance with another.Our latest example: Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill was let go by the Dolphins after years of bang average interspersed with brief flashes of brilliance – most notably a season that was cut short by a knee injury when Tannehill looked like he had finally pieced it all together.The Dolphins bailed. Tannehill was shipped to Tennessee. He rode the bench for a little while then took the lead role when Marcus Mariota was benched for his own stretch of mundane play. Then, liftoff.Tannehill exploded into, legitimately, one of the five best quarterbacks in the league. That sounds like hyperbole, but it’s a fact. By the metrics, Tannehill finished fifth or better in each of the following categories: DVOA, completion percentage under pressure, completion percentage to targets in tight coverage, completion percentage from a clean pocket, completion percentage on third downs.You might be able to bluff one of the metrics, but not five. Most importantly, he ranked second in the league in big-time throws v turnover worthy throws, the single best measure we currently have of a quarterback as a “passing playmaker”. He trailed only Russell Wilson and was comfortably ahead of Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.And the eye test was no different. Take the nameplate of his back and you would be conceived you were watching a perennial All-Pro: throws to all levels consistently nailing the so-called bucket throw, dropping a pass over the top of a linebacker and in front of a rotating safety throwing on the run running setting and resetting protections taking command of the whole offense making, big, BIG time throws on third downs, the one that decide a game or not.Tannehill was reborn. And while it’s tempting to scoff at the Titans putting out a massive contract to keep him around for the foreseeable future, what else were they supposed to do? Move on after witnessing that?Tannehill will likely regress back to his mean: an above-average starter who needs a good deal of help around but who can move and create on third downs, create off-script, and has a cannon of an arm. But there’s a chance, albeit a slight one, that something has clicked. That his second act is sustainable, if only for another season.So, who’s next? Across the league young veterans have switched teams, looking for a chance, any chance to land that sweet gig that moment in time when an offensive guru meets a gifted offensive line, a pair of decent receivers and a complimentary running back. When perhaps a starter goes down and it’s your time.The two most fascinating possibilities: Marcus Mariota and Cam Newton.Newton, a former No 1 overall pick and 2015 MVP is still searching for a team after his release from the Panthers.Ordinarily, that would be bonkers. Whether you think Newton is on the downside of career or not, he remains a starting-caliber quarterback in a league that’s lacking them. But Newton’s checkered injury record makes any potential signing an impossibility right now.Any team who would be willing to commit big money to the 30-year-old – and Newton will likely command big money, even if only on a one-year deal – will want to work Newton out to make sure he still has the same oomph in his legs and zip on his fastball, not to mention have their own medical experts take a look at his files. Until the current global pandemic subsides, that’s going to be a near-impossibility.At the peak of his powers, Newton was a singular force: A blend of size, speed and arm strength the quarterback position has never seen. He was a linebacker in the backfield, but one with just enough touch to shred defenses down the field. He helped take the Panthers to a Super Bowl in a funky offense that was built around his own quirks: his willingness to bang between the tackles and his penchant to mistime some of dropbacks, leading the team to take a whole bunch of timing routes out of the system. It worked! Newton was pretty much unstoppable. But he’s regressed since then. Injuries have taken over and his accuracy, which has always fluctuated based on his footwork, has become wince-inducing.But think how wild that above paragraph is. How odd it is to write about the past being the peak of Newton’s powers. Right now should be his peak. He’s 30, still blessed with all the physical gifts he’s always possessed but also with all the experience and savvy of a veteran. This is when he should be staking his claim as one of the league’s five most important players on a consistent basis, serving as the linchpin of perennial Super Bowl contender, not sitting out as a street free agent trying to prove he still has it.The spot that makes the most sense for a Newton comeback is in Los Angeles with the Chargers. Right now, LA lists Tyrod Taylor as its starter, with head coach Anthony Lynn saying he’s “their guy”. The only issue, we’ve seen systems built around Taylor before in Buffalo (with Lynn) and Cleveland. Neither started or ended particularly well.Taylor is a fine backup, but he’s a couple of ticks below Newton on the quarterback index. If the Chargers want to move away from the dropback passing system they ran with Philip Rivers and commit to the spread option, why do that with a smaller, leaner version or Newton rather than the real deal? Taylor might be a little bit more accurate as a passer. But it’s a nominal difference, and he’s also far less aggressive. Rolling with Taylor is an admission that a team is happy to be average-to-bad.Newton, at least, improves that risk profile to good-to-bad – that’s a gamble worth taking. Add to that, with Rivers leaving the Charges could use a little bit of star power, particularly as they get set to move into a new stadium. There are few higher-wattage stars in the league than Newton.One other option: The Rams. Sean McVay’s team is in cap hell and have been flogging assets. And you could make a decent argument, based on scheme-fit and accuracy without pressure, that you’d rather have Jared Goff than Newton. But I’d trust in McVay to adapt his system, and I’d sooner take the quarterback who is the same when pressured and when not, rather than the guy who’s accuracy and decision-making craters when there’s pressure in his face.Would Newton be open to a one-year, cheap deal to work alongside McVay and make a potential Super Bowl run? The idea is fairly tantalizing.But Mariota to the Vegas Raiders remains the most likely breakoutrebirth spot.Mariota was lethal in college in an offense that weaponized his north-south speed and lightning-quick release. He was smart, played within himself, got the ball out on time, and was all about maximizing efficiency, both with his arm and legs. He’s a timing player, not an oft-script creator. Planting him in a system that says control the game on first and second down then win it for us on third down was never his style thrust into that position he crumbled.“We got to rebuild him a little bit to get his confidence back,” Las Vegas general manager Mike Mayock said this week. By that, Mayock meant to restore him to his Oregon days. “I mean, he went through ‘Gruden’s (QB) Camp’ on television. I had him as the top quarterback in that draft. He knows that both of us believed in him coming out and still believe in him.”In Jon Gruden, Mariota finds a coach who sees his skills as a virtue, not a shortcoming. Is he a game-breaker? No. Can he efficiently take a team down the field, play within structure, make sure the team gets from a bad play into a good one, follow instructions, make throws on time and in rhythm, and lead a team to eight or nine wins, giving them a playoff shot? Sure.Mariota will have to beat out Derek Carr, who is due for his own second act any year now.

I’m trying to politely decline all the Zoom offers that are being thrown my way and I’ve been watching lots of TV instead.In terms of total escapism, something I’ve been going back to is my favourite sitcom: The Royle Family. I watched it when it was first shown, but I didn’t appreciate just how clever it was. It was always on in the background because my family loved it, but I was a bit more passive. I sat down a couple of weeks ago and went through it all again and realised how the cast are the most brilliant actors. It’s one of the only series that makes me properly laugh.It’s quite nostalgic for me, too, because their house looks like the house we grew up in and it feels very familiar – it’s like sitting in the living room with your own family. One of my favourite episodes is when they go to Prestatyn. They rarely leave the house, so it’s a big deal for them to be off on their holidays. Then they get to the caravan and Jim’s got the hump because there’s no chip pan and the telly isn’t that good. It really tickles me. I love Ricky Tomlinson as an actor and he’s such a sweetheart in real life he’s a really charitable man and very generous with his time.My partner, Kev, and I sat down on the sofa and got through five or six episodes in one go. It’s a running joke that Antony’s always sent to get the tea in the show – he’s the dogsbody – and that’s like Kev and I, taking it in turns to delegate and winding each other up.The other show I’ve got into is Tiger King. I do this all the time when people are talking about a show – for some reason, I only watch it later, mainly because I’m not in on the jokes and all the memes that are going around. Eventually, I gave in with Tiger King and it’s just so captivating – the characters are so charismatic and, even if I fundamentally disagree with most of what they stand for, I’m still so drawn to them. You’d believe it if it was fiction, but as real life it almost makes no sense.As a film-maker myself, it’s also amazing to see the access the team got for Tiger King and to be able to dedicate that amount of time to one story. That’s a luxury that few of us have now. It got me thinking about a documentary I made on big game hunters a few years ago in South Africa. I remember there was a debate around conservation there and it was less black and white to me, because they donated a lot of their hunted meat to the orphanages in the surrounding areas and they were assuring us that they didn’t shoot anything that was endangered.Stacey Dooley: Locked Up With the Lifers is on BBC Two on 19 April and Stacey Dooley: Costa Del Narcos is on BBC Two on 26 April at 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932a59f304fcdd8f09fff98cdc1ea35832d65ca8/0_106_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa482ae489cd83fc78921bf26ca81d0b","title":"how has access to outside space impacted you during the lockdown","story":"We would like to know how your experience of lockdown in the UK has been shaped by your access to outdoor spaceWith lockdowns in place around the world, we know that the experience of staying indoors is very different depending on your access to outdoor space.We’d like to hear how your access to space has impacted you over the last three weeks.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 201415, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Is it harder to do in the case of a respiratory infection?Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street. It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So the contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.What do the contact tracers do then?In the way it was operating in February, the tracer would call the contacts and ask them how close they had been to the person with symptoms and establish whether they were low-risk or high-risk. If the latter, they would be asked to isolate themselves for 14 days at home. The contact tracers would either call each day to check how they were or ask them to phone if they felt ill. If they developed symptoms, the tracers would start again, looking for their contacts in turn.Who does the contact tracing?It is organised by Public Health England, which had 290 staff doing it before community testing stopped in mid-March. Public health in recent years has been the responsibility of local government, so any increase in contact tracers might come from councils.Which other countries have done this to scale?South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine. Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d8c9b58f1b0ab9202b8fb04e2b52af1b02cff98/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74e5b0f8a544cc531b00a5b114dea675","title":"coronavirus exerts heavy toll on filipino community in uk","story":"Almost two-thirds of 29 people believed to have died so far worked in the health sectorAs many as 29 people from the Philippines or with Filipino heritage – including a Grenfell Tower fire survivor – are believed to have died from Covid-19, as the pandemic exerts a heavy toll on a community that helps form the backbone to Britain’s healthcare sector.Some 18 of those who have lost their lives worked in the health sector, in roles including NHS nurses and porters, healthcare assistants and care home staff. A number of others are critically ill in intensive care.Among members of the Filipino community to have died is Virgilio “Larry” Castro, 63, who survived the Grenfell Tower fire less than three years ago, the  has learned. He died on 9 April.Castro, who had worked as a maintenance supervisor and at a bar, initially tried to fight the blaze and escaped in shorts and a T-shirt. He told the inquiry that he often thought about it and had suffered breathing problems since.Castro lived with his family on the 17th floor of the 24-storey tower for 26 years. He and his wife, who died a decade ago, moved into the tower in April 1991 just after their daughter was born. “I have watched my daughter grow up in that flat and have many fond memories of living there as a family,” he told the inquiry. He said that he had cried at a CCTV image, provided by police, of him leaving the tower in only a white T-shirt and yellow shorts. “I still find it difficult to look at that photograph.”The deaths of at least 21 Filipinos in the UK have been confirmed by the  where Covid-19 was contracted or where they had been suffering from symptoms prior to death. A further eight people are on a list which community leaders have been compiling, where Covid-19 is believed to have been a factor.Echoing concern elsewhere, there is anger that Filipino workers are among those bearing the brunt of a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers.There are about 200,000 Filipinos in the UK, and 18,500 of them in the NHS according to House of Commons library data from 2019, making them the most numerous nationality working in the health service after Britons and Indians.“It is breaking our hearts because we are talking about friends, family and close colleagues,” said Emily Barrameda of United Filipino Global (UFG), an organisation which represents Filipino overseas workers.“Like so many others, we don’t know what is happening and it’s hard in some cases not to believe that there is also some discrimination. In some hospitals where there is a British person who is positive with Covid-19 and a Filipino one … it seems that they will choose to prioritise the British one.”She referred to the death of a friend, Amor Padilla Gatinao, 50, who worked as a nurse at St Charles hospital, in west London, and died after falling ill on Mother’s Day. The nurse’s husband has reportedly told how an ambulance crew refused to take her to hospital nine days before she died of coronavirus, after he took her there himself by car.Other Filipinos who have died include John Alagos, 23, who become the third UK nurse to die after caring for coronavirus patients and is believed to have become the youngest British medic to succumb to the virus.His mother, Gina Gustilo, has spoken of how her son fell ill at Watford general hospital after a 12-hour shift.Other victims included Oscar King Jr and Elbert Rico, two porters at Oxford’s John Radcliffe hospital who died last weekend weekend. King Jr, who was described as a devoted father to his 10-year-old daughter, died on Saturday an hour after being brought to hospital after isolating at home with symptoms consistent with the virus. King Jr’s wife, Twilight, has been recovering after she was also taken to hospital.The partner of Leilani Medel, 41, a nurse in Bridgend, South Wales, who died on 10 April has also been treated after being brought to hospital with severe symptoms of the virus. Medel had worked in care homes and hospitals for more than 10 years.Among others were Linette Cruz, a senior head nurse at the Brynteg dental practice in Sketty, Swansea. The married mother of one was described by colleagues as a woman who brought “love, light and joy” to everyone she met.Cruz, who trained in the Philippines and came to the UK several years ago, died on 14 April after being treated for coronavirus in the intensive care unit at Morriston hospital in Swansea.Elvira Bucu, an NHS care worker and mother of three whose husband was also infected, died on 3 April. Leilani Dayrit, a clinical nurse sister at the hospital of St Cross in Rugby, died of suspected Covid-19 on 7 April.Members of the community who were not healthcare workers include Arnel Ganias, a courtesy driver at Heathrow airport, and Romeo Castillo Jr, 34. Known to friends as “Romy”, he died after contracting Covid-19 on a work trip to Mauritius, which he had won as a reward for his good work.Antonio Lagdameo, the Philippine ambassador to the UK, said: “We are are deeply saddened by reports of Filipino staff at the NHS who are either infected by Covid-19 or have succumbed to the disease. Our thoughts are with their loved ones.“Filipino health workers have served tirelessly and courageously at the frontlines of the war against this pandemic, and their contribution to the ongoing effort to save lives is nothing but immense.“The escalation of confirmed Covid-19 cases and Covid-19-related deaths point out the undeniable truth that this disease is an existential threat even to the most healthy and fit among us. I urge everyone to follow government advice, stay home and help protect the NHS heroes who put their lives on the line for all of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278efe2de5529ef6c89322ec444d947899ed1b45/0_191_6145_3687/master/6145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4ca84860a0da052c379bffad8aad09c","title":"sick elderly pregnant the california renters being evicted even during the pandemic","story":"Despite new tenant protections, landlords are pushing out residents who can’t pay rent, making some homeless amid Covid-19When Covid-19 halted California’s economy, state officials promised to prevent evictions and defend tenants’ rights. But a dozen renters and their attorneys told the  that some landlords are proceeding to expel them from their homes despite the new regulations, indicating there are significant gaps in the protections.Those tenants include a pregnant woman, a cancer patient, an elderly woman, a mother of six, several newly unemployed low-wage workers and others vulnerable to Covid-19.Unable to pay rent in April, they have faced eviction notices on their doors, police officers attempting to remove them, pressure from property owners to immediately vacate and written demands from landlords spreading falsehoods about the emergency laws. Some tenants said they were moving out as a result, becoming homeless amid a pandemic.“We want to pay, but we don’t have the money,” said Virginia Gómez, a 51-year-old Los Angeles woman threatened with eviction from her home of three years. The property owner of her building last week repeatedly called police to try to remove her and her six children after she couldn’t immediately pay full rent due. “I told the police, ‘You guys are wearing masks and gloves, but you want to throw us out to the streets when the virus is out there?’ How are we supposed to ‘stay at home’ when they kick us out?”As California prepared to implement a shelter-in-place order to stop the spread of the virus, government leaders acknowledged that rent would be an urgent and vast problem. In March, the governor ordered a two-month statewide delay on imposing evictions for people who cannot pay rent due to Covid-19. The order prevents the enforcement of evictions until the end of May, but requires tenants to repay the full amount later. Some cities, like Oakland and LA, have adopted stronger protections.But the accounts and records from tenants across the state indicate those regulations ultimately fail to provide relief for those who are most in need, and are not being properly enforced. In some cases, the confusing patchwork of local ordinances has allowed landlords to continue targeting tenants in a state that had a severe housing crisis before coronavirus.Roughly 2.7 million people have filed unemployment claims in California since residents were ordered to stay home. Across the US, an estimated one-third of renters didn’t pay April rent.Though the courts are not currently processing evictions, some landlords are still starting the process, or unlawfully attempting to remove tenants. It’s difficult to know how many tenants across the state are threatened with eviction, but advocates in LA, the Bay Area, and parts of the Central Valley say they have anecdotally heard of a handful of cases in which owners have launched evictions. They are hearing more frequently about tenants facing misinformation and misleading threats from landlords.Krystal McMorris, 29, is pregnant and currently fighting to keep her apartment in Alameda, an island across the bay from San Francisco: “I don’t have any options. I have to stay here. I have to fight. If not, I will be homeless and pregnant. I already fear this stress is going to cause me to lose my baby.”McMorris worked for six years for FPI Management, a real estate corporation, as an on-site property manager, a job which included her apartment. After the pandemic was declared last month, FPI terminated her position and told her she had 30 days to move out, despite the eviction moratorium and regional shelter-in-place orders. When McMorris asked the company to allow her to stay until the Covid-19 emergency had passed, telling her boss she was pregnant, the company responded that she “does not have rights” and that it could have forced her out in three days, but instead gave her until 17 April.“If she fails to vacate by that deadline, we will take immediate legal action to regain possession of the unit as soon as legally possible,” Brandi Hutchinson, FPI senior director, wrote to McMorris’s attorney, adding that she would now owe $3,030 a month.Despite her fears of contracting Covid-19, McMorris went to multiple open houses around the Bay Area last weekend in hopes of finding a new apartment, exposing herself to strangers, but found nothing affordable or livable. “There’s no housing, no employment. Everyday I’m afraid. It’s been dreadful, scary, stressful, frustrating.”McMorris, who lost her health insurance and has been unable to go to the doctor, said she wants to leave her apartment, but has nowhere to go. “People are dying left and right. I was just asking that they at least give me more time.”FPI’s chief operating officer, Dave Divine, did not respond to specific questions about how the company plans to “regain possession” of her apartment, but said in an email that “FPI is compassionate to Ms McMorris’ situation” and has not forced her to pay rent . “FPI’s actions have been and shall remain consistent with all applicable laws.”Gómez, the mother of six, has lived with her family for three years in the Courtyard Motel in Downey, an LA suburb. Although it’s a motel, she and other tenants live there full-time and, according to attorneys, are protected under anti-eviction laws, including the new Covid-19 regulations. But after the father of her children lost most of his income at a restaurant due to Covid-19, the family ran out of money to pay rent. She said she pleaded with the motel manager, saying she would pay everything she had as soon as possible.Managers responded by calling the Downey police department to remove her, and officers showed up to her door, telling her she had to leave. Because she happened to be on the phone at the time with Monica Arellano, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of LA, the lawyer was able to talk to the officers and explain the law. Police eventually left, but the motel called the department again multiple times that day, requiring her to repeatedly explain her rights to new officers.She still paid the minimal cash they could, $370, after getting a check, leaving her with little money for other basic necessities. She said the managers continue to threaten her. “Anytime I leave my room, I fear they are going to call the cops on my kids, and I’ll come back and they’ll be kicked out,” said Gómez, who has lupus, a long-term autoimmune disease that puts her at higher risk of Covid-19 complications. “I keep telling them whatever money we have we’ll give it to them.”The Downey police department did not respond to inquiries. Reached by phone, Rushabh Bhakta, a representative with the motel, said his staff made a payment arrangement with Gómez after calling police.Sonia Aguilar, 43, who is recovering from breast cancer, has faced threats from her LA landlord, who has said he wants her family out by the end of April. Earlier in the year, Aguilar, her husband and three children had planned to move, but once the pandemic hit, it became impossible and dangerous for her: “I have underlying health issues and I only go out for food and medicine. I’m not in any condition to rent a U-Haul. It’s scary.”But the landlord, Ezequiel Navar, won’t stop calling them, she said: “The stress is making me more ill.”Some tenants are fighting hard to assert their rights in the face of eviction threats.“I knew it wasn’t an obligation to pay, and that it was better to keep that money for food and emergencies,” said Michelle Johnson, a 28-year-old LA resident recently furloughed from her job at a coffee company. After she told her property manager she couldn’t pay, the manager said she was required to submit three pay stubs, proof of unemployment and two bank statements, and then sign a payment plan. None of this is required by law. The manager then taped an eviction notice on her door, a “three-day notice” to pay or leave, the first step of an eviction lawsuit.“It was not only an intimidation tactic for me, but it was also for other tenants to see,” said Johnson, whose apartment is near the front door of the building. “Unfortunately for y’all, you picked the wrong informed tenant. I know this is illegal.”It was still emotional for Johnson, who experienced homelessness as a child. But she responded with an email reminding the manager of her rights, and then filed a complaint with the city. “The city isn’t doing enough to make sure landlords are doing their job.” (LA’s housing department did not respond to a request for comment.)Shirin Bina, 36, said she “completely fell apart” and cried for days after receiving a similar three-day eviction notice on her door in Oakland. “It just seemed like she had absolutely no regard for me as a human being,” Bina said of her landlord, Debra Reese. “She broke the ‘shelter in place’ to put that on my door.”Bina told Reese she couldn’t pay after losing a job as a bookkeeper and other work. She reminded her landlord of Oakland’s ordinance. Reese responded: “You failed to provide documentation and you failed to pay your rent therefore this method will be utilized.”Bina said she has struggled at times to understand her rights, adding, “If there’s such severe repercussions for a tenant not paying rent, there should be severe repercussions for a landlord abusing the law at this point.”Reese did not respond to inquiries.Chris Tyler’s landlord in LA asked that he sign an agreement saying he would immediately report his “stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, payments related to paid family leave, disability insurance payments and Covid-19 related loans” so the owner can ‘“accelerate amounts due”. Tyler, who works with the LA Tenants Union and lost his job at a bar, said he knew not to agree to the contract, but worries about others: “When you’re in a precarious situation, and you don’t know your rights, you obviously feel compelled to sign.”The LA Tenants Union has urged people to withhold rent and has called for lawmakers to freeze rent and mortgage payments during the crisis. If the state passed a rent forgiveness law, it would ensure tenants avoid insurmountable debts. In the meantime, advocates said, cities should proactively enforce the protections in place and hold landlords accountable when they violate renters’ rights.The tenants union is also assisting 70-year-old Pamela Fairbanks. She paid her rent, but her landlord, Steve Kaali, showed up at her door this week with an eviction notice, alleging she had too many cats. Fairbanks, who has lived in her apartment for 25 years, said she has long owned three cats. She said she has also been in quarantine for weeks while recovering from bacterial pneumonia: “I panicked. I was shaking. I could barely breathe through the tears.” Reached by phone, Kaali said the cats were an ongoing issue because they go in and out of the apartment, and his eviction notice was meant to be a “scare tactic” to get her to install a window screen: “I’m not taking her to court knowing I’m not going to win.”He added that he hadn’t tried to remove her from her rent-controlled apartment and bring in a higher-paying tenant: “I could’ve been a slumlord scumbag who kicks everyone out. I did not.”Jonathan Cañez and Tamiaya Moore, roommates who live in Bakersfield in the Central Valley, both lost their longtime jobs at a local hotel due to Covid-19. When they told their landlord they couldn’t pay rent, the manager told them they would owe the full amount and should move out if they can’t afford it.“We decided it’s better to just cut our losses,” said Cañez, 25, who is moving in with his brother. They didn’t know how they would ever be able to pay back the rent: “I’ve worked so hard to have this place to call my own, a safe space. To have that shift away from me has been very hard and humiliating.”Moore, 26, is going to sleep on an air mattress at a friend’s house for now. She’s been applying to jobs at grocery stores, but is also afraid of working there due to her asthma and the reality that essential workers are dying on the job. “I’m emotional because I was just getting my life together. Now it’s going to be rough for awhile.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f076725d5c5fb6452ffc9185218e32b75b3ff0a1/178_146_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b639b58c4d92aa601025cead0f62e25b","title":"uk to start coronavirus contact tracing again","story":"Matt Hancock says government to rebuild teams amid criticism it stopped strategy too earlyBritain is to restart tracing the contacts of people who have had coronavirus symptoms, the health secretary has said, reverting to a policy recommended by the World Health Organization but abandoned by the UK as the numbers of cases and deaths began to rise in early March.Matt Hancock told the health select committee on Friday that police, fire, prison and Department of Work and Pensions staff would now be eligible for coronavirus testing, amid growing concerns that the country will miss its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.A former director of the WHO told the hearing that contact tracing, testing and isolation could have continued for longer across the UK and would have enabled the government to lock down London while leaving other areas of the country with fewer restrictions.Prof Anthony Costello, the head of the Institute for Global Health at University College London, pointed out that Yorkshire had fewer than 10 cases identified in 300,000-400,000 people around the time that contact tracing and community testing were halted and, as such, could have avoided a complete lockdown.Critics have said the UK was too quick to stop the universal testing of people with symptoms, and following up with their recent contacts, who could then be asked to self-isolate.The WHO has repeatedly urged governments to pursue the strategy, which has been key to stopping epidemics around the world in modern times. “Tracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country,” the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in March.Other countries such as Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used it to contain their outbreaks, while Germany, which has a far lower case and death rate than the UK, has also worked hard on contact tracing.But on 12 March, Boris Johnson announced that the UK epidemic could no longer be contained that way. Testing was then restricted to those who were admitted to hospital, and contact tracing was stopped. The numbers of cases and deaths in the UK soared and a lockdown was imposed on 23 March.Hancock said on Friday that the government would rebuild the teams of contact tracers as part of a renewed testing and tracing strategy.His predecessor Jeremy Hunt, who is chair of the health select committee of MPs where Hancock was giving evidence, pointed out that South Korea had up to 1,000 contact tracers. “Public Health England had 290 people doing this at their peak, but they now say it has been wound down. Are we going to build it up again?” he asked.Hancock said yes and that contact tracing teams would be part of a strategy that included the use of a phone app to identify recent contacts and warn them that they might need to self-isolate.“The app is itself a contact tracing app, that is the point of it, to be able to assist iniduals to do contact tracing themselves by notifying people who they have been in close contact with when they have downloaded the app. And then of course link that to testing, so people can get the tests.”Testing, tracing and isolating the contacts of people with Covid-19 is expected to be a key part of the exit strategy for every country that has imposed a lockdown, as a way to keep control of the epidemic. Asked if he accepted that comprehensive contact tracing would need to be in place to lift the UK lockdown, Hancock said the government was working “incredibly hard” on the WHO-recommended strategy.“We do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible,” he said. “And we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people, and we’re building that resource, and obviously we need to have the testing and we’re ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and we’re working incredibly hard to make sure that we are.”Earlier, Costello said the nationwide lockdown could have been avoided, with only the capital facing severe restrictions.He said the example of 10 identified cases in 300,000-400,000 people in Yorkshire meant that in such areas people could have continued to go about their lives and work while maintaining physical distancing.Hancock admitted the government had discussed it. “We did consider having a London-specific lockdown and decided it was better to do it across the country as a whole.”This was because people would be travelling between London and other parts of the UK and, he said, it was striking how the country had come together to observe the restrictions. “To separate one part of the country from another has downsides in terms of the national unity we have seen in the response.”Johnson’s spokesman later declined to say anything beyond Hancock’s words on the possible scale of testing needed to implement a full regime of contact tracing.He also declined to comment on why the UK did not isolate or trace people arriving in the country from overseas, while adding that this policy could potentially change in the future: “We’ve always said that we don’t rule out taking steps if that’s what the science advises.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616c77b5b7be00424df70e728de7e9f1c89449e7/0_78_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd8f785ad11d6aed16a1388805c27aaa","title":"caught in a superpower struggle the inside story of the whos response to coronavirus","story":"Caught between the US and China, the world health body has been unable to enforce compliance or information sharing When a pandemic strikes, the world’s leading experts convene – physically or virtually – in a hi-tech chamber in the basement of the Geneva headquarters of the World Health Organization.It is called the “strategic health operations centre”, or SHOC, an appropriately urgent acronym for a place where life and death decisions are taken, and it is where critical choices were made in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak.“We’re mostly like a 1950s, never-been-upgraded place, except for the SHOC room, which was built with all the screens everywhere and the desks with computers that rise up.

The best expertise available to get the best advice possible, it’s a very impressive sense that hey, this is really how it is supposed to work.”On 22 January, it was in this setting that the WHO emergency committee convened to make a pivotal decision on whether to advise the organisation to declare a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) – a formal red alert for the world.The WHO had been sharing information with member states constantly since the first cluster of pneumonia cases was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December, but declaring a PHEIC still had huge symbolic importance.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, sat in the SHOC with his top advisers watching as a succession of speakers gave their views on the screens in front of them.First there were reports from China, and then Japan and Thailand where cases had been recently confirmed. Then it was the turn of the 15 members and six advisers on the emergency committee, drawn from around the world.The debate was highly technical but it had one critical issue at its heart. It was known by then that the virus had spread from person to person, but the question was how easily?If human-to-human transmission was only happening in close quarters, in families, or between patients and health workers, then perhaps it could be largely contained without a worldwide alert, and all the global economic disruption that entailed. If the virus was spreading freely among communities, there was not a moment to lose.The emergency committee was split down the middle on the question. So Tedros told it to convene again the next day, in the hope new data might create a consensus.“Tedros’s only obligation under the law is to convene a committee but not to follow it. But he feels that politically he needs to get a unanimous decision before he acts or at least an overwhelming majority,” Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said.The second day’s meeting however, changed no one’s mind, and the impasse remained. Tedros had the committee adjourn pending further study and put it on notice to reconvene at short notice. A international health emergency was declared a week later, on 30 January, after clear evidence of community spread of Covid-19 had emerged.The events of January were always destined for scrutiny. The WHO conducts an after-action report in wake of every pandemic. But by seeking to make the global body the scapegoat for the debacle of the US response, Donald Trump has ensured each detail will become exhibits in a highly-politicised show-trial, likely to last as long as the election campaign.Furthermore, the president has used claims of WHO’s dysfunction to justify cutting off US funding to it, worth over $400m a year, and hindering the organisation’s ability to help counter the spread of the pandemic in fragile and poor countries around the world.In a hail of accusations hurled at the WHO in recent days, Trump has accused it of withholding critical information about the danger of Covid-19, and being under the control of China.None of the accusations are supported by the facts.China argued against declaring an emergency on 22 January, but could not have carried the argument alone. The other emergency members and advisers came were experts from the US, Thailand, Russia, France, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Australia, Senegal, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and New Zealand.Their advice is confidential, but for the vote to have been split, several western, or western-aligned, representatives must have voted with Beijing.While the emergency committee took a week to decide to declare a PHEIC, Trump spent more than a month after that playing down the threat to the US, during which the country fell weeks behind the rest of the world in diagnostic testing and stockpiling essential equipment.There is no evidence to support Trump’s claim that the WHO hid information at China’s behest. The US is well represented in the top ranks of the organisation. There were more than a dozen officials from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) embedded in the WHO in January and February.US health leaders were part of regular conference calls, weekly or twice weekly, beginning on 7 January. From 10 January those calls included warnings about the risk of human-to-human transmission.Trump’s most recent line of attack has been that the WHO ignored vital warnings from Taiwan.“Why did the WHO Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that coronvirus could be transmitted between humans?” the president asked in a tweet on Friday, echoing a claim made by Taipei.However, the Taiwanese email appears to have made no such warning. It was sent from Taiwan’s CDC to its WHO liaison officer on 31 December, hours after the first official report of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan were published online.According to the text provided to the , the email said: “News resources today indicate that at least seven, atypical pneumonia cases were reported in China.”It restates the details of Chinese report, adding “I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us.”The email did not contain new information, and certainly nothing about human-to-human transmission. The WHO had picked up the same report on the night of 30 December and was urgently seeking more information. On 1 January it activated its incident management support team, putting the organisation on an emergency footing.The Taiwanese government has claimed that it did not receive a reply to its inquiry and was generally shut out from WHO deliberations. Since the UN voted to recognise the People’s Republic as the sole representative of China in 1971 and the World Health Assembly followed suit in 1972, Taiwan has not had full member status in the WHO, but it is involved in the organisation’s work.It is one of 15 non-state entities that have access to expert deliberations through an information network established by the International Health Regulations (IHR), a pact on collective action against infectious disease with roots stretching back to the nineteenth century. The latest version was agreed in 2005 by 196 countries, and it provides the legal framework for the work of the WHO.However, Taiwan says its participation is fragmentary and selective, largely because Chinese obstruction. A Taipei government statement pointed out that it reported its first confirmed coronavirus case on 21 January through the IHR system, but was not invited to participate in the three emergency committee meetings held in January, where its voice may have made a difference.“The Covid-19 outbreak is a reminder to all the world once again, that politics has barred Taiwan from contact and communication with WHO and global public health experts, and this can only gravely damage global cooperation in epidemic prevention and control,” the statement said.Tedros has also drawn criticism for his tireless praise of China and Xi Jinping’s leadership, hailing Beijing’s transparency despite the critical early weeks left when the authorities tried to cover up the extent of the problem in Wuhan. The director general’s defenders say such diplomatic flattery is the price of ensuring Chinese cooperation with information and WHO site visits. Tedros also complimented Trump in a March 23 tweet, claiming he was doing “a great job in the fight against Covid-19”, and Trump was also effusive in praising Xi in the first weeks of the pandemic.“They’re making it seem like he’s a crony of China, but he’s caught in the middle of a super power struggle competition,” Gostin said.The WHO also provided ammunition to its detractors when, on 14 January, it put out a tweet citing preliminary Chinese studies finding “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission”.It was issued on the same day the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove (a US immunologist) gave a press briefing in Geneva warning of precisely the opposite – the potential for rapid spread. Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing. In so doing, the WHO exposed itself to the charge of contributing to an air of complacency. But the tweet was factually true and does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy.Again and again, the events of January reflected the difficulties Tedros and his organisation faced in negotiating a path between two hostile superpowers, and the egos of their leaders, without any independent powers to enforce compliance and information sharing.However, what mistakes that may have been made in charting that course have little to do with the lethal fiasco that unfolded in the US in the two months after the WHO raised an international alarm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:At least 2.2m have been infected worldwide and at least 153,177 people have died since the outbreak began, according to Johns Hopkins University.The figures, which are based on official data and media reports, are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes.Capt Tom Moore, the British second world war veteran who sought sponsorship to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, has now raised more than £20m for National Health Service charities.Moore has been hailed as a “one-man fundraising machine” by the Duke of Cambridge.Chile will become the first country to issue “immunity cards” to those who have recovered from Covid-19, exempting holders from quarantine so that they can return to work.Chile’s health minister announced that some of the cards will be issued according to the presence of antibodies to the virus, despite difficulties in producing reliable tests.According to the most recent official data, 18,681 people have now died in France an increase of 761 in 24 hours. The death toll in hospitals rose to 11,478 from 11,060, while fatalities in nursing homes rose to 7,203 from 6,860 on Thursday.An unprecedented US policy that uses the pandemic as grounds to summarily expel people who have migrated to or sought asylum in the country violates international law, the United Nations warns.The British government announced that a further 847 people have died in UK hospitals, taking the total to 14,576 since the outbreak began. That represents slightly decelerated growth. But the figures do not take into account those who have died in other settings.The European commission says 98,900 EU citizens are still stuck abroad, though efforts to bring them home continue. That compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak.Health bosses in England are preparing to ask doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating patients, as hospitals are set to run out of supplies within hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e863d360a0a688ea46bb0c1b5354991733a3537e/0_12_2420_1452/master/2420.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6c300b3811bce0f8c62250b08e1c55c4","title":"the flowers dont know were in lockdown farm donates blooms to key workers","story":"Unable to sell its produce, a Bath grower is giving its flowers away to a local hospitalThe Electric Daisy Flower Farm’s business relied on selling its blooms grown near Bath at a newly opened shop in Hampstead, north London.But, as the managing director, Fiona Haser Bizony, says: “The flowers don’t know we’re in a lockdown.”The shop – only open since February – closed on 17 March with an abundance of unsold flowers.“And they keep on growing,” Bizony says. “On the day we closed the shop, all the spring flowers that were delivered from our farm to London, I decided to give away to anyone who happened to pass by.”After Bizony saw an article about how a Dutch market was dealing with the same problem, she decided to donate bouquets of flowers to key workers at the Royal United hospital in Bath, and others to the care home where her mother lives. Other key workers are also receiving them and they have been donated to funerals.“The RUH was the first drop-off, and then we went to doctors’ practices and care homes, and anyone we could find who needed flowers,” she says.Dr Benjamin Clayton, from one of the Covid wards at the RUH, says the flowers “really helped to lift our spirits, and I’m incredibly grateful”.Bizony, who has been growing flowers for six years, has also delivered a bunch to Alexandra Knaggs after her recent home birth.“We gave her a huge bouquet of spring flowers,” she says. “Tulips and anemone and ranunculus. It was bright and colourful and very scented.” Knaggs says she and her newborn daughter appreciated the “wonderful luxury” of the gift.Despite the future being unclear, Bizony hopes to send more bouquets to frontline staff. “The bulbs have been planted and we have just put manure on to the rose beds because we’ll need the roses in time for June,” she says.But she is unsure of what will happen to the shop in the future.“We have to see what the government says.

So as public concerns mounted over the arrival of Bulgarian fruitpickers this week, it is important to note this is an industry that cannot source sufficient manpower locally to do the work. Ireland needs approximately 1,500 seasonal workers to pick soft fruit and vegetables over the next two months.Defending its reliance on Bulgarian workers this week, Keelings said it had experienced declining interest in Ireland in recent years and needed to employ 900 seasonal pickers between April and October. Up to 70 per cent return year after year, it said. Few applicationsThis year, the company advertised locally for staff more than two weeks ago but had received just 27 applications by last week. It received a further 13 applications on Friday. According to the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) “probably 100 per cent of horticulture farms have some form of labour from overseas”, typically from Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and, in recent years, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. “Most of these seasonal workers have been returning to the same jobs and farms for years and therefore are already fully trained and suited to the nature of the work,” it said. “In the past two weeks there has not been any major interest in jobs advertised in the sector. Even during the last recession when unemployment was at 15 per cent, there was very little interest from the domestic labour force.” Farm accommodationThose who come to Ireland supply the soft fruit sector from May to September, vegetables from June to November, and protected crops such as tomatoes from April to October. In most cases, accommodation is arranged by the farms. On Friday, a statement from the Government said: “Seasonal workers are critical to the agricultural sector in terms of harvesting, planting and tending functions, especially in the current season.” The EU has defined agricultural seasonal workers as essential workers. According to the IFA, Germany recently relaxed its rules and is allowing 80,000 seasonal workers into the country during April and May.It said it was “very important to stress that the workers will be following all guidelines issued by the Government in relation to Covid-19”.

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is facing internal pressure from grassroots members of the party who say they should be given a vote on any potential coalition deal with Fine Gael.Local members of the party have expressed concerns that they may be denied a vote in the process and say it would be “madness” not to hold a postal ballot.Mr Martin on Thursday told RTÉ Radio’s Today with Seán O’Rourke that holding an ardfheis to ratify a coalition deal with Fine Gael could be difficult.He also said he didn’t think a postal vote would be “feasible at this stage”, adding that party rules say there should be an ardfheis.Party sources confirmed that the Fianna Fáil executive, comprising about 80 people, can make a decision on whether the party enters government with Fine Gael if a special ardfheis cannot be held. Such a move would be met with significant pushback by grassroots members, however.Lifelong party member Willie Kavanagh, who is based in Wexford, said that “every paid up member of Fianna Fáil is entitled to have a vote”.“Headquarters can just send a ballot to every member and it is a simple yes or no question. I don’t go along with the idea that it would be hard to have a postal ballot. Our membership is due at the end of June, and I’m sure they’ll find a way to remind us about that.Responsibility“I am not in favour of this coalition but I would abide by any majority decision,” he said.“I favoured a national government that could stay in power for a period of two years. If we go into coalition with Fine Gael, it is the end of Fianna Fáil. Who will be in opposition, it will be Sinn Féin.”He said that he believed Sinn Féin should be part of such a national government and said he believes “they have to take their share of responsibility. It is easy to make big noises when you’re in opposition”.Mr Kavanagh said that he has fought in, and taken part in, many elections and in February voters were being told that Fianna Fáil would not do a deal with Fine Gael.“We can change our mind on Fine Gael, so why can’t we change our mind on Sinn Féin?”Fintan Cox, who is a Fianna Fáil member in a Leitrim cumann, said it would be “madness” not to hold a ballot of party members.“What is the point of being a member if we can’t vote on something as important as this? If this goes wrong we could end up at 14 or 15 per cent in the polls while we let Sinn Féin take no responsibility. If Micheál had done a deal with Sinn Féin, he would be taoiseach by now. Now, Sinn Féin are off the hook and we are going to have a far-left radical government in five years.“So there should be postal ballot, absolutely. This caretaker Government could go on for months. We just need to give a yes or no and return that. They did it in Labour and for the Seanad.”He said he would have supported a national government of all parties followed by an election.“Going in with Fine Gael is putting the whole party at risk,” Mr Cox added.President of Ógra Fianna Fáil Tom Cahill said that a “number of Ógra units across the country have held their own votes on it, some as recently as last night, and so far all have voted to oppose. Our focus now is ensuring that a vote of the full membership takes place on any potential government deal that may be reached.Preference“We could still be a few weeks away from seeing a programme for government and it’s impossible to know what way restrictions will be at that stage. I think there will be logistical issues no matter what method is chosen.”He said a postal vote is his preference if a special ardfheis is not an option. “When we get to that point, I do think it’s doable but it may need a bit of creativity.”Meanwhile, the three smaller parties all held separate meetings on Friday to discuss the joint policy framework released this week by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.Sources in the Green Party say there are major concerns emerging about the lack of costings and detail in the document.

There are now more people who have recovered than those who are newly infected,” Mr Spahn told a press conference in Berlin. Angela Merkel this week identified the reproduction factor as a key measurement of when lockdown measures can be lifted. German government scientists have declared lowering it to under 1 as a major target in bringing the outbreak under control.“The strategy we have pursued so far is showing success,” said Prof Lothar Wieler, head of the government-funded Robert Koch Institute (RKI), which is overseeing Germany’s response to the virus. “The positive trend is that the increase in the number of cases has slowed significantly. Not everyone with the virus is infecting another person.”But Prof Wieler warned it remains to be seen whether the reduction will be sustainable. “We survived the first wave well, but we mustn’t overplay this achievement,” he said.“The goal has not yet been reached because the number is not yet permanent. The goal now is therefore not to reduce the number further, but to keep it stable below 1. We must not overlook the fact that this has cost us enormous effort.”Germany has carried out more testing for the virus than anywhere else in Europe, with more than 1.73m tests so far.It already had more intensive care beds than any other European country at the start of the crisis, with 29,000, but has since increased the number to 40,000.Following the fall in infections, hospitals will begin to return to a normal footing and non-emergency surgery will be resumed from next month, Mr Spahn announced. “Four weeks ago, we told those who had already faced long waits for back or hip surgery that their operations would have to be postponed. That caused pressure and a fair bit of emotional and physical suffering,” he said.“That’s why I think it’s important, as we gradually return to a new normal in public life, that we will find a new balance in the hospitals from the beginning of May.”Around a quarter of intensive care beds will be kept free for coronavirus patients, Mr Spahn said.Six out of seven patients experienced mild courses of the virus and could be safely treated as outpatients, allowing hospitals to focus on the most serious cases.The announcement comes as Germany prepares to begin gradually lifting lockdown measures, with many shops due to reopen from Monday. But Mrs Merkel this week used the reproduction factor to explain how fragile the situation remains, and that Germany\u0027s health system could quickly be overwhelmed by a rise in infections.“If it reaches 1.1, our health system would reach crisis point in October,” she told a press conference on Wednesday, when the R0 was at around 1. “At 1.2, we would reach the limit as soon as July. With 1.3, we would already be at limit by the end of June.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government extends furlough scheme another month coronavirus","story":"The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has extended the multi-billion pound wage subsidy scheme until the end of June in an attempt to protect jobs during the coronavirus crisis.The furlough scheme, under which the Government pays 80 per cent of wages for workers up to a maximum of £2,500 a month, will run for an additional month.Mr Sunak said the decision was made as a result of the three-week extension to the lockdown, which was announced by the Government on Thursday.The Coronavirus Job Retention scheme was initially meant to run for three months to the end of May. The scheme, which has taken time for HM Revenue and Customs to set up since Mr Sunak announced it, will formally launch on Monday, but payments will be backdated to March 1.The initial three months had been estimated to cost £30 billion to £40 billion, and the initiative is designed to encourage businesses to temporarily furlough staff instead of making them redundant.On Friday, the Treasury said the month-long extension would allow it to continue to protect millions of jobs.Mr Sunak said: We\u0027ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide Job Retention Scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity. It is vital for people\u0027s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the CBI, which represents 190,000 businesses, praised the Government\u0027s agility with the scheme and said its extension would help protect the economy and prevent unnecessary job losses through this new lockdown phase.She added: This extension means that firms will no longer be forced to issue redundancy notices over the next few days to comply with 45-day consultation requirements, and can instead return to focusing on protecting jobs and their businesses.  Frances O\u0027Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress said: Employers must continue to make full use of the scheme to furlough workers and protect jobs.

And, I think, it has a very strong chance of working.The researchers said it is crucial to ensure the vaccine can be manufactured quickly enough to be rolled out on a mass scale when they are sure it works.Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, cautioned that the whole development process of a vaccine must be covered.He added: This taskforce will ensure the UK can take an end-to-end view. This includes funding research, like the recent NIHRUKRI call, and ensuring manufacturing capability to deliver a COVID19 vaccination as quickly as possible.”Professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford, said the team probably has the most ambitious scale up programme of all the groups working on a vaccine.It\u0027s pretty clear the world is going to need hundreds of millions of doses, ideally by the end of this year to end this pandemic, to let us out of lockdown, he said.A vaccine is the exit strategy for this pandemic and then we\u0027re very likely to need a vaccine in future years because it\u0027s unlikely we\u0027ll be able to eradicate this virus.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the government is working flat out to find a vaccine as quickly as possible, having pledged £250m towards the goal.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: “UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible.”Professor Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, added: “The pace at which this work has been carried out is tribute to the UK’s world-class research base and its dedication to the fight against this disease.”The World Health Organisation last night cast doubt on how effectively antibodies can protect iniduals who have recovered from Covid-19. Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, Dr Maria van Kerkhove said: “These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of seroprevalence, that level of antibodies, but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies means that they are immune.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers consider whether public should wear face masks help","story":"The public may be asked to wear face masks in new advice next week under measures designed to help Britain out of its coronavirus lockdown.Ministers will consider a review by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) examining whether the routine wearing of masks should be recommended for those who are out and about. Growing numbers of medics are calling for the advice to change in line with countries such as China and South Korea. This week, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, called for it to be compulsory for people to wear masks in public while the coronavirus epidemic continues.Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said: There is a review that Sage is carrying out.  We are looking at it now. The evidence is quite variable around masks – it\u0027s not easy to really get a firm position on some of it.He said the committee would look at the matter on Tuesday and hope to issue advice on any changes. UK advice is currently in line with World Health Organisation guidance, which does not recommend the routine use of face masks.But a number of scientists believe the fact the virus can spread without symptoms showing means that masks may be more useful than would be the case in other illnesses. Sir Patrick said: The difference between this disease and others is the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread, which is an added complexity.But one thing is clear – it\u0027s absolutely crucial that the masks are available in hospitals and other settings which are at high risk of transmission, and that\u0027s where the evidence is very strong that they do work.A Cabinet source said that although the Government was being led by the science, public pressure would also influence the decision.Public and media pressure pushed the lockdown and, when it comes to face masks, again that will come down to public and media pressure even though there is evidence suggesting they don\u0027t make much difference in the general public, they said. Consideration will be given to whether masks might be advised for use on public transport and in workplaces.Ian Jones, professor of virology at Reading University, said: It\u0027s obvious that even a flimsy mask provides a level of protection, if not absolute protection. The argument is moving away from protecting people from catching it to stopping people from transmitting it, so a national roll out would be advisable. They should be part of the unlocking procedures, because this virus isn\u0027t going to disappear.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has previously warned that routine use of masks by the public could increase shortages for NHS staff on the front line.On Friday, medics said the public should be encouraged to create home-made masks. Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care research at Oxford University, said: We are going to have to wear masks for quite a long time, but it should be a non-surgical approach – we should be encouraging people to make their own and masks for each other.She also said it might become advisable for children to wear masks if the Government\u0027s aim was to protect 80 per cent of the population.Someone\u0027s going to have to invent a mask that a child can wear comfortably. It may have to become part of the school uniform, she said.The chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has so far said the public use of face masks is a very live issue.Earlier this week, Prof Whitty said: What we are really trying to do is to work out under what circumstances, if any, should we extend the advice. The evidence is weak, but the evidence of a very small effect is there under certain circumstances.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one towns collective trauma 1918 spanish flu saved another","story":"When the last deadly pandemic swept across America, the small copper mining town of Butte was particularly hard hit.The Spanish flu of 1918 claimed the lives of more than 1,000 of its residents - around a third of the state of Montana’s total casualties. The powerful business owners who had an interest in keeping the mines running refused to shut down, allowing the virus to spread unchecked.This time around, the town - scarred by the memory of the tragedy - has taken no chances.Butte, which has a large Irish immigrant population, was among the first to shut down bars and restaurants and even cancelled its famous St Patrick’s Day celebrations before the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in the state.Most in the town have relatives who died during the influenza outbreak, or know people who did - a collective trauma from the past which has shaped the present.“Shutting down St Patrick\u0027s was like an earth tremor here but it was accepted with wisdom and understanding,” Father Patrick Beretta, the priest at Butte’s Immaculate Conception and St Patrick Parishes, told the . “I walked my dogs that day and I did not see a single gathering - a seismic departure from the wild celebrations of the past.”Father Beretta, who is studying how communities around the world build resilience, promptly decided to take his service online: broadcasting live on YouTube on Sundays rather than risk the health of his congregation.“We had closed our churches even before the order came to do so,” he said. “The trauma of 1918 is still haunting the collective memory of today. As a result people here took very seriously very early on the coronavirus dangers.”Residents began self-isolating long before Governor Steve Bullock declared a statewide lockdown. Butte has one of the highest rates of compliance in the country.Its swift action seems, at least for now, to be working: counting just six confirmed cases of Montana’s 208.The picture was not so rosy a century ago.The saloons servicing thirsty miners remained open, as did the brothels, allowing the flu to run rampant.At the height of the outbreak, 10 residents were dying a day in a town with a population of 100,000. Local newspaper the Great Falls Tribune reported “the undertakers no longer garage their \u0027death wagons\u0027, but leave them in the street as the calls became so frequent.”The high school was repurposed into a hospital ward and still, much of Butte remained open for business. The deaths only began to slow when the town finally started to close down in November 1918, nearly 10 months after the first detected case.The death toll ended up being on par with San Francisco and Philadelphia - two of the worst-affected cities in the country.“Mortality rate here was astronomical, largely as a result of the nature of mining life, confinement underground and above ground in overcrowded boarding houses,” said Father Beretta.“The Irish Butte inherited an intensely social culture. Churches, pubs, halls were always packed providing voracious vehicles of contagion.”He said the particularly rich “emotional landscape” of Butte was shaped by two defining tragedies and the recovery from them: the 1917 Granite Mountain mining disaster, which saw 168 miners killed in a fire, and the 1918 flu.It was also influenced by the resilience of the Irish after the great famine of the 1840s. The earliest Irish immigrants to arrive in Butte were children and survivors of the famine.“My town was one of the places hardest hit in America, in part because many believed the cure was worse than the disease,” saidKathleen McLaughlin, a local Butte journalist, quoting a recent speech by President Donald Trump in which he suggested ending the shutdown. “When you hear that reopening the economy is preferable to warnings of public health experts who want us to stay home and distance ourselves, remember the graveyards in Butte.”Butte, which now has around 35,000 residents, has rallied in recent weeks. Seamstresses in the town have turned their hand to making masks for medical workers, pop-up delivery services are ensuring the elderly and vulnerable are getting daily meals.Resident Sabrina Holland said its history of hard times gives people a greater appreciation of the need for a community to pull together. “Butte people have a sense of history that is so deep within us, that we see a current crisis as not a current crisis, but another thing to get through,” said Ms Holland, whose great-grandfather Daniel Holland died from the Spanish flu in 1919. “It’s such a Butte mentality. We’ve been through so much, we can survive,” she told the Montana Free Press.Father Beretta said that while the town understands the measures it needs to take, it has not stopped people suffering from the social separation that it has imposed.“The community hurts not being able to gather in sympathy,” he said. “But every day I think of the people of 1918. They are my teachers in coping emotionally with this pandemic, they are the teachers of the entire Butte community.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/17/TELEMMGLPICT000229007724_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4lB4GFcd2ffyksCJoOxtkbT5LfTkYhqvBvjfatlPy1M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"public miles ahead experts coronavirus face masks","story":"In Germany, face masks are now recommendedAt the top of Government, there are fears about introducing any nuance into the Stay at Home message. The Cabinet wants to keep the directive simple. So it’s not very encouraging that on one of the simplest questions of all: “Should I wear a face mask?” the message is clear as mud.A review is under way, Grant Shapps said yesterday. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, isn’t waiting for that. He wants us to wear one. In Germany and America, face masks are now recommended. In other countries, they are compulsory.While the intricacies of vaccine discovery or ventilator production are beyond the vast majority of us, the principle behind face masks isn’t. Coughed or sneezed droplets spread the disease. Yet, asymptomatic people spread it too.The very best masks prevent wearers (usually doctors) from \u2028getting infected. But even simple surgical masks help prevent those carrying the virus from spreading it, which may be particularly useful since the non-appearance of any meaningful testing programme means we don’t know who has Covid-19, and very probably won’t for many moons to come.So, given ample supply, surely it would be a good idea for us all to wear masks outside? Particularly as part of any exit strategy, given what we know about the immense effects of even minute adjustments in transmission rates.Many health agencies, including our own, have disagreed. Yet, it turns out that they have largely based their views on a single source: the World Health Organisation. So, if the Government continued to trust that WHO advice, why the review? Should we be surprised if, as in America, having been nudged to assess the situation themselves, officials here change the advice too?Perhaps the Government is maintaining its wait-and-see approach because, as with other protective gear, there are still not enough masks to go round. But that would make its “guided by the scientists” stance a deception.If that stance is true, however, then it is worth remembering that those scientists the Government is guided by can make mistakes and be subject to bias like the rest of us.On face masks, the public has been ahead of the game. But the pressure of “common sense” would have been useful even if it had been common “nonsense” – forcing a validation, rather than a change, of the existing advice.This is not to say that we’ve had enough of experts. Far from it. In a time of immense crisis their work is vital. But the mask debate shows that we, too, have a duty, to deploy that age-old wisdom of crowds, whether right or wrong, to challenge and be annoying, and make those experts investigate not just the disease but their own assumptions too.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

All declined to give their name for fear of retribution and censors have wiped online content about the protest.“It’s no surprise that there are protests like this after the lockdowns began lifting,” said a salesperson at a shop overlooking the courtyard where protesters had been rounded up by police. Many shops have yet to open despite Wuhan’s mass quarantine restrictions officially lifting on April 8. In some cases, employees have not returned to the city and, business-owners say, few people are out leisure shopping anyway.“Even if you do open now, at least for a month or so there won’t be many customers,” said a shop attendant.Clashes across China underscore the difficult task the government faces in trying to contain social unrest as it endeavours to restart the world’s second-largest economy. Just how far the economy has fallen was revealed on Friday, when Beijing announced its worst economic contraction in decades. In the first quarter of the year, gross domestic product plummeted 6.8 per cent.“We have definitely seen an uptick in the number of protests by workers, including small business owners...asking for rent reductions,” said Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a NGO that advocates for worker rights.Beijing needs to juggle conflicting priorities: it must urge people to stay at home to prevent a second outbreak, maintain social stability, engineer a return to work and promote consumption to boost growth. The risk of instability is growing as companies furlough or lay off workers and reduce wages. Five million people lost their jobs in January and February, according to government statistics. Experts think four times that could become unemployed as the year unfolds. The real rate of unemployment, however, is likely much higher, as millions of migrant labourers in China work odd jobs to make ends meet. They also work without contracts and have not paid into the state unemployment program, which means if they get laid off, they will not receive benefits.“A lot of people depend on the gig economy. It really is a very day-to-day existence,” said Mr Crothall. “Even if you have a job, it’s probably going to be very precarious – one week, you might get paid another week you might not.” Taxi drivers, largely unable to work during the coronavirus crisis, have been amongst the most active protesters. CLB has noted 25 strikes by taxi drivers so far this year – compared to 54 for all of last year – primarily asking for fee reductions in what they pay taxi companies and lower insurance rates, or to be able to exit the industry without penalties.On Monday, a group of Wuhan hotel and apartment rental managers trying to stay afloat – some of whom had offered free accommodation to medical staff – sent a letter to local authorities seeking subsidies, loan guarantees, rent deductions and other incentives they said could help them get back on their feet. The Chinese government – at local and central levels – have announced targeted measures to support small and medium-sized businesses, such as tax breaks and lowering the amount employers must pay for employees’ social insurance.Loan rates were also reduced with the hope that banks would open more credit lines for smaller businesses. “The reality, though, is that banks are sort of very conservative here, and don’t want to take that risk,” said Ben Cavender, a principal at China Market Research, a consultancy. “Small business is probably still not receiving the money that it needs to keep going.” About 500,000 companies have already shut down, with many more expected, delayed in filing the onerous and costly paperwork to declare bankruptcy, he said.The government is “going to have to come up with ways to pay workers directly, rather than just giving companies incentives not to lay people off,” said Mr Crothall. Otherwise “it’s going to be difficult for a lot of workers to earn enough money just to pay the rent and get by.” Additional reporting by Yiyin ZhongMore from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/17/17/macbook.jpg","title":"apple mac update battery charge life power","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Laptops may not charge up all the way all the timeApple is rolling out a new feature called battery health management that will change how laptops charge themselves.The update will mean that laptops may not charge themselves all the way up all of the time, if the computer believes doing so will protect the life of the battery.It aims to avoid a problem that means fully charging a laptop\u0027s battery puts a strain on it, because of the chemicals inside. Leaving a computer charged up in this way can therefore reduce its capacity, leading the battery life to fall over time.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, if the computer believes that it is not likely to need 100 per cent battery in the future, it will only charge up some of the way. The computer will show that the battery is full, but it may not actually be.The feature can be turned off and may not be activated in all situations, Apple said. It will also ensure that the battery life is not significantly affected, the company said.Everything you need to know about the new iPhone SEA similar feature is already in place on Apple\u0027s iPhone, and was introduced in a recent update. It means that the phone will learn when it goes on charge at night and when you tend to wake up, for instance, leaving the final bit of charge until it expects you to get up and start using your phone.The Mac update will work in largely the same way, using its history of charging and battery use to notice times when you tend not to need the full battery life. If a computer tends to be used plugged in throughout the day, for instance, it may not charge up its battery fully.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

That is why we are expanding this generous scheme for larger firms.This is a national effort and we\u0027ll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that our £330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible.Ministers have made clear to banks that they want them to lend quickly to any viable business affected by coronavirus that needs funding.Figures released this week by the banks\u0027 lobbying group UK Finance showed that only 6,020 loans totalling £1.1bn had been approved for small businesses under CBILS, though the number had doubled since last week.Around one in five applications have been approved so far but many small firms say they have enquired and decided not to apply or been told by their bank that they are not eligible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its orbit is similar to the famous Great Comet of 1844, and it is thought that the two might both be pieces of what was once a larger comet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is why we are expanding this generous scheme for larger firms.This is a national effort and we\u0027ll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that our £330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible.Ministers have made clear to banks that they want them to lend quickly to any viable business affected by coronavirus that needs funding.Figures released this week by the banks\u0027 lobbying group UK Finance showed that only 6,020 loans totalling £1.1bn had been approved for small businesses under CBILS, though the number had doubled since last week.Around one in five applications have been approved so far but many small firms say they have enquired and decided not to apply or been told by their bank that they are not eligible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I misspoke,” he said.“As a heart surgeon, I’ve spent my career fighting to save lives in the operating room by minimising risks.“At the same time, I’m being asked constantly how we will be able to get people back to their normal lives.”He went on to describe\u0026nbspschools as “places of security, nutrition and learning” for children.Many states in the US are currently wrestling with potential timelines to ease lockdown\u0026nbsprestrictions without triggering a renewed spread of the virus.Donald Trump on Thursday gave governors a road map for recovering from the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, laying out “a phased and deliberate approach” to restoring normal activity in places that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases.The new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations.They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public health in their states.Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools. In phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged.In phase two, people are encouraged to maximise social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume. Phase three envisions a return to normal for most Americans, with a focus on identification and isolation of any new infections.The guidelines recommend that states pass checkpoints that look at new cases, testing and surveillance data over the prior 14 days before advancing from one phase to another.The Associated Press contributed to this reportThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But experts tell Jon Stone it still isn\u0027t clear to what extent pupils could spread coronavirusThe government is showing no sign of easing its coronavirus lockdown restrictions, with another extension to the measures confirmed on Thursday. But the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is reported to have privately made clear that if it were up to him, schools would be reopening at the first safe opportunity.The issue is contentious: the science of to what extent children contribute to the pandemic, and by how much, is uncertain. Childcare is becoming an issue for many parents who are not key workers and thus entitled to still send their children to class. And with what started as an extended Easter holiday is in danger of turning into several months off school, pupils are starting to miss out on serious amounts of education.“I suspect we might open schools again, partly because there is still debate about whether school closures are actually beneficial or not,” Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia tells The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We’ve not answered that, and there are very good reasons why school closures, in terms of the children, might actually not be that useful. And if they don’t get that ill, maybe they’re not that infectious – but it is a maybe.”This uncertainty is key to the question of how long this extended Easter break might turn out to be, and whether it starts to turn into a summer holiday before children go back to class.Police find 17 bodies piling up inside nursing home morgueNurses suspended after refusing to treat patients without N95 masksUK coronavirus hospital death toll rises to 13,729Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in disease modelling at the University of Warwick, tells The Independent that even if children are less effective vectors for the virus, the fact that so many of them would be crowded into schools could pose a risk.“The problem is there’s still an awful lot of uncertainty, and this is the real concern we have,” he says. “We know from the data coming in that children tend to have much more mild symptoms than the older age groups. Where there is still a lot of uncertainty is how much they transmit and this is a big concern.”Children themselves might not be getting sick, but could still be acting as carriers for the disease.“Even if someone is asymptomatic and has no symptoms at all it’s still possible they can transmit the virus. If someone has very clear symptoms and is coughing a lot they’re much more likely to transmit and spread droplets, so it’s very likely that people with very severe symptoms will have a higher transmission rate,” says Dr Tildesley.“But what we don’t know and what’s still uncertain is the role of these asymptomatic or mild cases in infection. This is the concern because of course even if that’s lower the fact that you’ve got a lot of children in one place is a concern.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith repeated government promises to ramp up Covid-19 testing falling short, there is very little data around about the extent to which people – never mind children – are even being asymptotically infected. Until that bottleneck is sorted, it will be hard to judge exactly how many people are carrying the virus. But with seriously ill people and NHS workers being prioritised for the limited number of tests, people with no symptoms are a long way down the list.The manner in which\u0026nbspthe lockdown\u0026nbspwas implemented\u0026nbspis also a problem, as it becomes difficult to separate out the different measures and tell which ones are making a difference.It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.“It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.”At this point, any decision to reopen schools, even if it was based on the available scientific evidence, would be a guess –\u0026nbspbecause there isn’t much scientific evidence yet available. But many teachers are worried about being flung into the classroom as an experiment when the science is not yet clear.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union tells The Independent\u0026nbspit would be reckless to put “political or business” considerations ahead of safety.“Everyone is anxious to return to normality as soon as possible, but decisions to either strengthen or loosen the current restrictions must always be governed by the medical and scientific evidence. Political or business considerations must never be allowed to override the safety of pupils, school staff and the wider community,” he says.“The NASUWT is committed to work with the government to protect public health and the health of our members who, along with other public service workers, are doing so much to help the country through this crisis.”One option being recommended by some epidemiologists is bringing schools back, but with specific social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus: setting desks further apart, closing playgrounds, asking children to keep their distance. Teachers could also be given protective equipment (PPE): another union, the National Education Union (NEU) has written to the prime minister asking him to base any decision to reopen partly on the “availability of appropriate PPE and enhanced levels of cleaning”.One study published in The Lancet medical journal, which looks at data from the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, suggests schools could come back earlier if students could be prevented from mixing and have social-distancing measures imposed during class.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered if restrictive social-distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time,” said Professor Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study.In Denmark, schools this week started to reopen in a staggered manner, with different arrival times and just the first five year groups plus kindergartens back for now. The youngest children are going back first because they are thought to be the least vulnerable to the virus and also the most difficult to arrange childcare for, keeping workers tied up looking after their families.But if the UK’s 506,400 full-time teachers are to be given protective equipment, the UK’s supply lines, already insufficient for NHS staff and care workers, are a long way off from being able to cope. And teachers say that there are other practical issues to consider.Katharine Birbalsingh, the high-profile headteacher of Michaela Community School in Brent, north London, has said\u0026nbspit was a “lie” that social distancing is possible in schools.“The fact is that social distancing in schools is simply impossible,” she said. “We’re considered to be the strictest school in Britain and even we would find it impossible.”Number of full-time teachers working in the UKMs Birbalsingh said\u0026nbspshe understood that “schools cannot stay closed for 10 months”, and that they might have to open eventually, but said the government should be upfront with teachers and the public about the risks.“Schools will open at some point, but what I don’t want is for people to perpetuate the lie –\u0026nbspand it is a lie – that social distancing is possible. It just isn’t,” she said.Staffing would also be an issue, the headteacher told the BBC, with supply teachers not an adequate replacement on such a grand scale.“The other thing to remember is that from the point of view of a head teacher, if you have to send home staff who have underlying issues, if you have to send home your staff who have a cough you are probably going to have fewer than half your staff in. So if you have half your staff in, how are you filling your classrooms with teachers? You can’t.“And you’ve got to think about the kind of chaos that then ensues in schools when children don’t have their own teachers – you have cover teachers, and we all know what you used to do in schools when you had a supply teacher.”Dr Tildesley also notes the problems, telling The Independent: “Possibly for secondary school children it’s easier to implement a policy like that for primary school, that’s a challenge –\u0026nbspI’ve got two six year olds, trying to explain to them the concept of going back to school but not hugging their friends is a real challenge. I think that’s difficult.”lockdown extended for three weeks, says Dominic RaabDespite these concerns, other countries in addition to Denmark are going ahead with reopening schools anyway. Germany announced on Wednesday that it would start opening schools early next month, and Austria and France have also set tentative timetables.Given the lack of clear information, this, says Dr Tildesley, could be “useful” for the UK authorities in deciding which way to go.“We are seeing other countries in Europe who have declared that they are going to start sending children back to school earlier than us. That will also give us some evidence,” he says.“It would be really informative to use to look at their epidemic curves and how they might change when children start to go back to school. Of course, every country is different but it would at least give us some evidence of what that effect might be.”But, he adds, evidence would take several weeks to filter through, given the virus’s incubation period – and if schools reopen at the same time as other measures are lifted it would be harder to disentangle the effect. It is for this reason that the European Commission has asked countries to leave gaps of weeks between phasing out different measures stating that “sufficient time should be left between the steps (eg one month), as the effect of their lifting can only be measured over time”. Whether member states, under domestic political pressure of their own, adhere to this will remain to be seen.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)“There is going to be something of a lag in that and two, three weeks really before we start to see strong evidence of what the effectiveness of that policy is,” Dr Tildesley said.If the government makes the leap to opening schools any time soon, it will be somewhat of an experiment.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the most vulnerable children and we have published guidance on how schools can employ social distancing during this period. We will only re-open schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so, and will consult closely with the sector on our approach.”“There’s always a trade off here,” says Dr Tildseley. “I accept this as an infectious disease modeller, we tend to be very focused on trying to minimise the risk to human health of the virus, but of course there is another aspect of this and it’s something I’m aware of: you can’t stay in a lockdown strategy forever.“If all we cared about was minimising deaths then essentially you would persist with lockdown. But there’s a practical side to it. At some point you’ve got to start to visit measures for lifting.“This becomes a really difficult political decision because you have the problem of if you open them and it’s deemed to be too soon and cases begin to climb again, you could start to lose public trust.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits.

It doesn’t only have to work, it has to be safe. And for a disease like this it has to be very safe, if you are going to use it right across the population. There’s a lot to do before we are in that position.”He added: “Each single project doesn’t have a high probability of success. So although everyone goes into it with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it is never the case that we know we are going to get a vaccine that is going to work.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We stand firmly behind them in their efforts.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible.”Mr Sharma also announced 21 new research projects to receive funds from a £14m government pot for the development of treatments and vaccines.An Oxford University project to trial an anti-malarial drug with anti-inflammatory properties in order to determine whether it can reduce the harm of Covid-19 to high-risk patientsImperial College London tests on a potential vaccine designed to stimulate the body’s production of protective antibodiesA Public Health England effort to develop a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progressionA Public Health England study into the transmission of Covid-19 on materials found in hospitals and households, including fabric, plastics, metals and ceramics.Joining Sir Patrick and Prof Van-Tam on the taskforce are representatives from government, academia and industry, including the government’s life science champion Sir John Bell, drugs giant AstraZeneca and the Wellcome Trust.They will aim to make the UK a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing, building on existing research and development expertise.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We’re doing everything possible to save lives and beat this disease, and that includes working flat out with businesses, researchers and industry to find a vaccine as quickly as possible.“The UK is world-leading in developing vaccines. We are the biggest contributor to the global effort and are preparing to ensure we can manufacture vaccines here at home as soon as practically possible.”The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said: “The UK has some of the best vaccine scientists in the world, but we need to take account of the whole development process. This taskforce will ensure the UK can take an end-to-end view. This includes funding research … and ensuring manufacturing capability to deliver a Covid-19 vaccination as quickly as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Others said it was “natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat”.Alongside the popularity of southeast Asia’s wildlife markets selling a wide variety of animals for consumption, the trade in dog and cat meat has been rising over the past three years, the organisation says.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Before the outbreak, about 10 million dogs and cats were slaughtered for eating in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia every year, according to Four Paws.But its investigators said they had witnessed and heard how\u0026nbspsales of the meat in the region had risen during the global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“We had expected the trade to be curtailed after the outbreak and in view of the restrictions,” said Katherine Polak, a vet and head of Four Paws’ stray animal care in southeast Asia. “But were surprised to find the traders saying business was better than ever.”The research teams interviewed sellers in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, and in the northwest\u0026nbspCambodian town of Siem Reap and capital, Phnom Penh.In Siem Reap, she said their teams found a few traders had closed, but those that remained were “rewarded with better business”.With each trader selling at least three dog carcasses a day, about 300 dogs are being killed in the town daily, they estimated.Illegal wildlife traders cash in on coronavirus with rhino horn ‘cure’China promotes bile from caged bears to treat coronavirus Indian traders ‘risking more viruses with squalid animal slaughter’ China bans eating wild animals including pangolin in coronavirus blitzExperts pressure WHO over live animal trade to prevent more pandemicsMeat buyers in both Cambodia and Vietnam told the investigators that the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspannouncement on cats and dogs not catching the virus prompted people to think that eating them was safe.“Our team who talked to the traders reported an initial decrease after the outbreak because people thought maybe there was a relationship with the virus, but the Cambodian government dismissed that notion after the World Health Organisation said dogs and cats were not a risk. The WHO\u0026nbspsaid that to prevent mass abandonment of pets –\u0026nbspbut it had the opposite effect.”Consumption had also risen because people staying at home want to try more “exotic” meat, Dr Polak said.In interviews last year, patients had told Four Paws how medical professionals had advised them to consume the meat for its “warming and healing properties” thought – falsely – to ward off flu viruses and the coronavirus.The meat is particularly recommended to women after giving birth and is said to increase blood flow for women during their menstrual cycle.Animals around the world benefit as coronavirus halts tourismBut a report\u0026nbsptwo months ago by the group, which has studied the trade in the three countries, concluded there was no evidence for any of the medical benefits claimed by health professionals.“Patients are routinely advised by health practitioners of the health benefits, and vendors are reporting to us that their customers are partaking in dog meat consumption due to the ‘health benefits’,” Dr Polak said, adding that she strongly suspected doctors were now recommending it\u0026nbspeven more in view of Covid-19.In Indonesia, people widely believe dog meat cures respiratory illness –\u0026nbsplargely asthma – so demand for it in that country could soar, Dr Polak said.The animals may be strays or stolen pets, or are bought by traders\u0026nbspwho exchange them for pots and pans.Vendors in Cambodia and Vietnam stand in masks at the roadside, providing bags of the meat, which may be cooked on the spot or for customers to take home.Dogs and cats blowtorched alive at Indonesian street marketsCambodia’s capital Phnom Penh has more than 110 dog meat restaurants, many of which opened within the past\u0026nbsptwo years, Four Paws says.Since the coronavirus pandemic, the organisation’s teams found that a few had closed but most had switched to providing takeaway services.And restaurants across the country are advertising dog and cat meat dishes for delivery on food delivery websites and apps.“This is concerning because we had never seen dog and cat meat dishes being advertised on a food delivery app before the Covid-19 outbreak. It demonstrates that the dog-meat industry is adapting to the increased consumption at home and increased ease of obtaining dog and cat meat, even during a lockdown,” said Dr Polak.“The insanitary conditions of the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many different animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases\u0026nbsplike Covid-19.“The rampant trade and live animal markets across southeast Asia are ticking time bombs. If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.”Last week China\u0026nbspclassified dogs as pets, not livestock, for the first time – a move campaigners hope could signal an end to that country’s dog and cat meat trade.Four Paws, which is campaigning for a total ban on dog and cat meat, has long warned of the risk of the spread of rabies from the pet meat trade.The news comes as The Independent’s Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign calls for an international effort to tighten restrictions on wet markets to reduce the risk of future pandemics.A recent study has proposed that the virus might have travelled from bats to humans via stray dogs.cat and dog meat\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz. BBC’s nearly perfect World Cup Rewind series .The quietly brilliant BBC News health correspondent Fergus Walsh and his cameraman Adam Walker deserving awards for their coronavirus reports from UCL Hospital.And the bloke from pest control making a polite exit from Channel ’s The Mum Who Got Tourette’s: “Did Simon tell you I had Tourette’s ”“The thing that gave it away was when you opened the door and called me a c***.”Smug THIS week’s winner is Phillip Schofield and the Mekon from Eagle comic.Sent in by David Thompson, via email. Picture research Amy Reading.But that’s care homes for you, I suppose.Steph McGovern using the phrase “I love it” an average of . times every show.Psychopathic Mexican drug cartels failing to deal with Gordon, Gino and Fred, on their ITV road trip, while they had the chance.And Have I Got News For You ler Ian Hislop claiming: “The Prime Minister’s in hospital, not good for comedy, is it ” ’Cos it wouldn’t be an issuehe A ever bothered cultivating a wider range of targets than just Boris and Trump and B was actually funny.The Steph Show, Jason Manford: “I’ve been watching the show, Steph, and it’s great.”The Steph Show, Steph McGovern: “I set a challenge for Ruth Davidson and Sandi Toksvig to find something in their house that’s a waste of space.”Challenge  That’s no challenge.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Half of those , deaths are blamed on coronavirus.We do not know how the other half died, although some will have missed le-saving healthcare because of the ­pandemic.What we do know is that this hideous virus is killing the economy.The Office for Budget Responsibilitywarns a three-month shutdown will slash growth by more than a third, push unemployment up by two million and raise borrowing by an eye-watering  per cent.Lockdown has destroyed Britain’s “jobs miracle”, put paid to a fragile “Brexit bounce” and triggered what could be the worst depression in living memory.“It is important people know there will be hardship ahead,” warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak, an under- statementever there was one.On your one-hour daily exercise break, you can see the tragedy unfolding.Once-thriving restaurants and bars, busy offices and shops and key construction sites are locked and bolted.Behind every door is a personal and economic tragedy.Despite a torrent of taxpayers’ cash unleashed by Mr Sunak, many will never reopen. Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come. Some of it will be paid for in blood.Without cash from tax revenues, how do we meet Sunak’s pledge to fund — “whatever it takes” — our wonderful NHS and its costly new le-saving treatments The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCan we afford a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state, good schools or the promised infrastructure linking North and South with better roads and railways One day a vaccine will bring this miserable pandemic to an end. But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity. There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished. It leaves headroom for ato work and school.The sooner that begins, the sooner we will see the “rapid bounce back” forecast by the OBR.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We sing very close to each other and partner dance and there’s even kissing – and then there were the packed audiences too.When they made the decision to shut down it was still a major shock.As a single mum without much financial help I was scared we’d be out on the street. I have a friend who works at Sainsbury’s and she hooked me up with a job two weeks ago and I absolutely love it.The people I work with are genuine and lovely and I plan on staying as long as they’ll have me. It’s not as much as the West End would pay, but I am just starting out.I do nine-hour shts starting at am, working the tills, manning the queue, helping the online team – very dferent from my usual job. I spend most of those hours on my feet working and it’s exhausting.But I feel proud when I can help someone find what they’re looking for and don’t have to ask a colleague. Everyone at Sainsbury’s is like family and they’ve really welcomed me in.Obviously it’s far less glamorous than starring in the West End but I enjoy the challenge of learning new skills and working with people.I look forward to the theatres re-opening and getting back to singing on stage but for now I’m happy to just sing in the aisles!But Jenner isnt the only Brit to have swapped the spotlight for a new job during this pandemic.Keegan Brown, , from Carisbrook in the Isle of Wight is the th best player in the country.He has put his darts career on hold and taken on extra shts as an assistant in an NHS blood-science lab.While playing on the PDC pro tour – a series of darts tournaments for professional players – I tried to work three days a week in my lab assistant job, he tells Sun Online.This would normally consist of two full days am to .pm and one day from am to pm. But since the darts calendar has been put on hold I’ve been doing a minimum of five days and the hours can be anything now, including night shts and also on-call days.I figurethe NHS can use my skill set to help or support the service, then I want to offer anything I can to help in the midst of this pandemic. We have all been up-skilling too, to help backfill when people are being forced to take time off.The NHS has always had a family-feel but even more so now as we’re working under such dferent circumstances, something I’ve never experienced.My we Roz is extremely proud of me but also very worried. She worries about everyone!But I am so lucky to love both of my jobs. They come with highs and lows and there are times I prefer one to the other, but overall they both make me happy.The darts is more full-on, intense and competitive and you’re mostly judged on the last game you played.It can be an emotional rollercoaster and you do have to learn to grow a thicker skin.Working for the NHS can also be full-on and intense but you’re working as part of a team – rather than on your own - and you do feel like you’re making a dference.I’m not practicing my darts as much as I’d like to, but I am still keeping my arm in as much as possible. Just last night I was playing online darts with some children from a darts academy. The academy contacted me and I was happy to help!Leivi Saltman, , from North East London, is a professional photographer - but is now working at a greengrocers.I’ve been a professional photographer for six years and cover everything from engagements and weddings to charity and corporate events, he tells us.A typical day is editing photos, keeping my social media updated and going on location visits to scout out a venue so I can figure out lighting and places to get the best angles and atmosphere.Then in the evenings I’m usually out photographing events.When I first started hearing about the virus, there wasn’t a massive effect on my work and only one or two jobs were cancelled. But once the government ruled there should be no public gatherings, that pretty much tied my hands. Twenty-five events were cancelled or postponed, which was the majority of my events leading up to July.A friend of mine put a post on Facebook that a local greengrocers were looking for help and I thought, ‘Why not I am earning less compared to my photography, but it helps to structure my day and gets me out the house. It’s a full-on day starting at am and finishing at around pm.My typical day is unloading the lorry, which is full of fresh fruit and vegetables bought from the market that morning at am.Once the lorry is unloaded and put in the fridge, the remaining tasks include stocking up the shop, putting together customer orders and making sure there aren’t any empty shelves or shelves low in produce.There’s a lot more manual labour involved than in photography, but it’s surprised me how much I’ve really enjoyed it.I like meeting new people each day and being a part of a team rather than working on my own. It feels like I’ve become a part of their family and I’ve learnt a lot about dferent types of fruit and vegetables and how you should store them.Of course, I’ll be going back to photography when the crisis is over, but I will miss the greengrocers too.

But thats Cressida Dick for you.Another added: Met Police Chief Cressida Dick was on Westminster Bridge last night and did nothing!A stunned doctor at St Thomas Hospital filmed the crowded scene and wrote: Im a doctor working at the hospital thats right there. And yes, I was also somewhat perplexed by the lack of social distancing...Dr Damir Rafi told the : Though people may have wanted to go outside to show their support for healthcare workers, applauding them while being in a crowd is likely to have done more harm than good.As a doctor, I’m seeing that things seem to be getting better regarding the state of the wards and number of admissions. It’s all due to social distancing.Even though it’s dficult for everyone, it’s working. I’m concerned that people may become more lax as time passes, and so would strongly encourage them to keep it up so that progress is maintained.The bridge was packed last night with well-meaning families, young children and emergency workers - but many were failing to socially distance as they packed together facing the hospital.Every Thursday at pm since Britain was put into lockdown the nation has clapped out of windows and at their front doors to thank frontline workers.Medics have said the weekly clap gives them a boost during gruelling shts, but last night those gathered on the bridge were slammed for potentially creating more cases for staff to tackle.politan Police Commissioner Dick led dozens of officers in the weekly applause for key workers at pm last night.A video posted to the forces Twitter account shows her standing in front of officers, who are lined up with gaps in front of police vehicles along the bridge near Parliament.But the gesture drew criticism from some after the clip filmed by DrRafi emerged showing groups of people, near police officers, seemingly ignoring social distancing guidance.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: We would ask that everyone takes responsibility and adheres to social distancing rules so that we can safely show our appreciation for those who are working so hard to fight coronavirus.He added: We would ask that in showing their appreciation for those who are working so hard as carers, they do so in a way which adheres to the social distancing rules.SUN readers are today urged to sign a petition calling for our NHS staff to be awarded the George Cross.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs.A furious nurse wrote under the video: This is just really infuriating!!!! I’m a Nurse  this scene made me sick!!!It’s more appreciatedsocial distancing was practise here than the clapping itself! Do we really CARE   Expect for more weeks of torture, more casualties because of this!!!And another said: It was a pointless exercise that made a mockery of the measures put in place.Public gathering on westminster bridge, ignoring social distancing, to clap the people who could end up now treating themthey’ve spread the virus among that crowd.Others blasted the crowd for blocking the road - one of the main ways in to the busy hospital - and criticised the officers who have been seen patrolling parks making sure people are sticking to restriction rules.A politan Police spokesperson said: Officers, along with other emergency service workers, came together last night on Westminster Bridge to celebrate the work of all key workers.A large number of members of the public also gathered to express their gratitude.While many people adhered to social distancing guidance, it appears that some did not. We regularly remind our officers of the importance of social distancing where practical, and will continue do so.Yesterday coronavirus deaths in the UK  jumped to , today after  more patients died in hospital. According to the Department of Health , people have tested positive for the deadly bug - up , from Wednesday.The long bank holiday weekend was blamed for the climb in daily coronavirus deaths.But experts said the slight rise was expected and was probably due to hospitals clearing a backlog from Easter.It comes as Britain is set to stay in lockdown for at least three more weeks until it passes five key tests, Dominic Raab announced yesterday.The Foreign Secretary’s checks include ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed by coronavirus victims and seeing a steady reduction in deaths.Health Minister Nadine Dorries tweeted: “There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a ­balance between the health of the nation and our economy.“The introduction of a relaxation easement strategy eventually leads to a full exit.”Among the latest deaths is -year-old nurse Mary Agyapong, who died of coronavirus five days after her baby was born.It is understood doctors performed an emergency caesarean on the medic shortly after she was admitted to hospital last week - having lost her dad to suspected Covid- just days earlier.Mary joins over  NHS heroes who have sacriced their lives to treat patients during the crisis.It comes as War hero Captain Tom Moore completed  laps of his garden yesterday, raising more than £ million for the NHS.The -year-old WWII veteran completed the last few laps on his zimmer frame - and insisted he will continue for as long as people keep giving money.It comes as Britain could stay in lockdown until June over fears lting the drastic measures too quickly could lead to a second wave of the pandemic.Ministers feel pushing the lockdown to May or even June would be the right move.Others believe keeping it shut for too long risks a complete economic meltdown.Plans are being considered to reopen some primary schools and nurseries next month - with schools outside London and Birmingham set to be the first to open once the lockdown is lted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was backed by fellow Labour mayor, Liverpool’s Steve Rotherham.But the pair’s call risked a major backlash from unions, who warn that hospital staff are facing a daily battle to find the PPE they need.World Health Organisation official guidance says people need only to wear masksthey have Covid- symptoms or are caring for someone who does.And it adds: “WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources.”It also warns against another of Mr Khan’s suggestions — that people reuse masks. Last night Chief ­Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said they were looking at the evidence and hoped to provide clearer advice on masks next week.He added: “At the moment we’re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. It’s absolutely crucial that masks are available in hospitals and in other settings which are high risk of transmission.“That’s where the evidence is very strong that they do work.”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCountries including Austria and the Czech Republic have ordered citizens to wear face masks at work and in public spaces.In Spain, which began to ease its lockdown last week, police and Red Cross volunteers handed out free masks at bus, rail and metro stations.In the US, New Yorkers were ordered to wear masks in public from Wednesday — despite President Trump vowing not to wear one.Angela Merkel has warned Germans they will have to wear masks on public transport and while shopping once the lockdown ends.And in Lombardy, one of Italy’s worst-hit regions, people must wear them outside. The French have been told to don them on trains until summer at least.But asked about Mr Khan’s comments, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: “There is evidence that it could be counter-productive so I think it’s right to ask the scientists to provide guidance on it.“If the scientists come out and say, ‘Yep this is actually what people need to do’, then we will absolutely ask people to do that. But until they do that, that isn’t the message that we’re going to be sending.”Experts say all but expertly fitted high-grade medical masks can be largely ineffective.Researcher Paul Hunter, of East Anglia University, said public transport or supermarket workers might benefit, but added the protection offered “wasn’t great”.Professor Ben Cowling, who studied masks for the University of Hong Kong, said: “They reduce the risk, butpeople spend more time in crowds then that offsets the benefit.There are many practical issues to consider before everyone is asked to wear a mask outside the home.London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan rightly says it would be wrong to tell the public to buy surgical masks as this would massively cut supplies available to NHS and care staff.He suggests bandanas or other fabrics — but they can’t stop a mph sneeze.Masks need changing every three to four hours but just to give everybody one mask a day means half a billion a week are needed, requiring production of , every second. We don’t have that capacity.To be effective, we also need lessons in their proper use, such as not touching the mask’s front as you take it off and how to fit it from under the chin to the bridge of the nose.“We need to make sure masks are an additional measure and not a replacement for other measures.”Shaun Bailey, London’s Conservative candidate in next year’s mayoral election, tweeted: “The mayor knows nothing is stopping him from providing PPE to every London transport workerhe wanted to.”Meanwhile, Waitrose showed off new anti-coronavirus visors — quickly compared online to Darth Vadar’s helmet.

If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.Despite the global pandemic, the continued sale of dog and cat meat in the region has seen a transition from a cruel ‘dine-in’ to a ‘to-go’ service.With  dog meat restaurants across Cambodias capital of Phnom Penh, vendors are taking sales one step further by offering dog dishes on food delivery apps.Vendors can also be seen wearing facemasks on the roadside as they hand out bags of dog meat for customers to eat or prepare at home.In Vietnam, a similar trend has been observed particularly in the north of the country, where dog and cat meat consumption has a longstanding history.Doctors are also said to be promoting the consumption of dog meat because it is perceived to be ‘natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat’.One seller in Cambodia said that those in her community believe that, ‘dog meat is good for health and helps ward off cold or viral illness, like COVID-’, however the meat is often linked to outbreaks of cholera, and cases of trichinella and rabies.The meat can be a cheap alternative but Micheal Chour, founder of animal charity the Sound of Animals, says that the rise in dog and cat meat consumption is due to Chinese influence, with many restaurants only opening in the last two years.He told the Sun Online: People are still eating a lot of the meat in these areas because they believe it to be a cure.They was a big increase in the number of Chinese workers coming to the country and they have bought many of their practices along with them.Many of those, such as torture, have been introduced here and people believe that because China is a big and powerful country, that we should be listening to these practices.There is a very little warning from the government because wet markets are good business, they are still happening.In the wake of the COVID- pandemic, the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai have banned the eating of dogs and cats as part of a wider clampdown on the wildle trade.Yet in the absence of a national ban, other cities in mainland China are believed to be considering their own legislation to stop the consumption of dogs and cats.China has also drawn up new guidelines to reclassy dogs as pets rather than livestock, as part of a response to the coronavirus outbreak.The announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture was described as a potential game changer in animal welfare. The new virus, which is believed to have originated from horseshoe bats, put a spotlight on Chinas wild animal trade.COVID- - which was first identied in the Chinese city of Wuhan - could have been passed onto humans by intermediary species on sale at a wet market.Those markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together, have been described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve.As it stands, Vietnam has  cases of coronavirus and no recorded deaths with Cambodia having  cases and no confirmed deaths.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailHow well has the Government handled coronavirus  The outbreak is the biggest ­challenge faced by the country since the Second World War. It has required a huge economic bailout and an immense effort by the NHS, care staff and other key workers.But has the response by Boris Johnson ’s administration been adequate Here our experts look at what the Government got right and what they got wrong, and deliver their verdicts. Lockdown WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT We managed to introduce lockdown measures without shutting vital public spaces. This approach has managed to maintain extremely high levels of public support for the measures. Covid- victims are infecting on average fewer than one person each – the crucial “R” reproduction number threshold which,social distancing is maintained, will kill off the outbreak. This has been achieved while keeping most parks open and allowing daily exercise. By contrast, Italy shut public spaces entirely from mid-March, which exacerbated mental health problems in the population. No also made a good call in using experts to sell its social distancing message. England’s Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty and Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have been vital in maintaining public trust. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG We introduced lockdown measures slower than almost all of Europe. The Government’s mantra on this is that it is “guided by the science” – but in reality, such decisions are a judgment call by politicians. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet decide which experts on its Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies to listen to most and then interpreted their advice. In mid-January, when China locked down Wuhan, few thought it would happen in liberal Europe. By early March, many countries were shutting down. But here, Boris Johnson was still joking about shaking hands with patients on a hospital visit. The PM and his team got updated modelling that triggered a U-turn on March . Data from Italy suggested that unless we were also locked down immediately, , people would die in a matter of months. Now, our death rate per capita is twice that in Ireland and we are tipped to have Europe’s worst outbreak. VERDICT An increasing number of experts believe we acted too slowly – but a final assessment is only possible with full data after the pandemic. Testing WHAT THEY GOT RIGHTWe were one of the first countries to develop its own coronavirus test.Public Health England’s swab test was used to contain the outbreak as patients were isolated after ing from abroad. Detailed contact tracing was then carried out so everyone in contact with a confirmed case could also be isolated. This delayed widespread community transmission and is the main reason we are two or three weeks behind the likes of Italy and Spain in outbreak trajectory. Hospital bed numbers were low at the start of the outbreak but this swt action bought the NHS time, enabling temporary Nightingale hospitals to be set up. Intensive care was also kept within capacity in the first wave. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG The March  decision to abandon widespread community testing shocked scientists. This was the start of the much-disputed “herd immunity” phase of the strategy. It went directly against World Health Organisation advice for governments to “test, test, test”. The decision came amid an initial clamour for tests by the general public from GPs. From this point, only the most seriously ill patients in hospitals were tested. It soon became clear other countries were outstripping our testing capacity. Germany was achieving remarkably low death rates after scaling up testing using private labs. The UK decided to initially only use PHE’s Colindale lab before some NHS labs were kitted out to do swab analysis. While we were withdrawing from the arms race on testing, other countries were building up supplies needed to analyse the swabs. And as the Government came under pressure to ramp up testing, lack of supplies hampered efforts. VERDICT The decision to axe community testing and contact-tracing means we have no reliable data on how widespread Covid is outside of hospitals – which could delay an end to lockdown. PPE - personal protective equipment    WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT The Government says we have enough personal protective equipmentfor all who need it. But it admits there have been distribution problems, hampering efforts to deliver equipment where it needs to go. Since the beginning of the outbreak,  million pieces of PPE have been delivered to the front line. The Royal College of Physicians has said a combination of revised PPE guidance issued two weeks ago by Public Health England, plus the NHS drive to get millions more pieces of kit to the front line, had made a big impact on the shortages and helped to allay the fears of workers. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG To frontline doctors and nurses, it doesn’t really make a dference what caused the problem. Hospital trusts are reporting “critically low” supplies, with the British Medical Association reporting “dangerously low levels” in some parts of the country. A survey by the Royal College of Surgeons found a third of surgeons did not have access to enough masks, gowns and other equipment. And a BMA survey last week found half of doctors felt pressured to work in high-risk areas despite not having adequate PPE. VERDICT Whatever the cause of the shortages, the Government either did not recognise the scale of the problem or it did not respond to it quickly enough. The economy    WHAT THEY GOT RIGHTIT is a month since Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s Budget pledge of £billion for coronavirus-hit companies.Smaller firms were promised emergency cash through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme while big companies could access funds via the Covid Corporate Financing Facility. That is without the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, where firms can reclaim % of workers’ wages, up to £, a month. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG ONLY just over , smaller firms have had loans through the CBILS, out of , that managed to apply. There have been more than , enquiries. Banks are accused of failing to respond, dragging their feet, making business owners jump through hoops, or in some cases unfairly rejecting applications.  Around £.billion of CBILS loans have been approved. Together with the £.billion loaned through the CCFF, it is .% of the £billion earmarked by the Chancellor. Amid criticism, Mr Sunak has now launched the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme for firms that could not access either pot of money. VERDICT The Job Retention Scheme could be a game-changer in preventing millions more workers getting the chop. But the go-slow on loans for firms is a cause for concern, especially with , companies already in trouble.

But the Government is backing our scientists, betting big to maximise the chance of success.Mrs Dorries, Health Minister for Patient Safety, Suicide Prevention and Mental Health, made the claims on Twitter.She tweeted: Journalists should stop asking about an ‘exit strategy.’ There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine.

Professor Anthony Costello, of University College Londonaposs Institute for Global Health, told a committee of MPs that the harsh reality is that we were too slow with a number of things and deaths could reach to ,.His comments came as the Department of Health said a total of , patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of pm on Thursday, up by  from the day before.Prof Costello said: If weaposre going to suppress the chain of transmission of this virus in the next stage we all hope that the national lockdown and social distancing will bring about a large suppression of the epidemic so far - but weaposre going to face further waves. And so we need to make sure that we have a system in place that cannot just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory, but has a system at district and community level. Prof Costello, giving evidence to the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, said we should not have any blame at this stage but that we can make sure in the second wave weaposre not too slow. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that testing will be expanded to those in the police, fire service and prisons, as well as critical local authority workers, the judiciary and Department for Work and Pensions staff where required.  It follows criticism of a gulf between those being tested and the testing capacity, with just , tests being conducted in the  hours up to am on Thursday, despite , tests being available. Mr Hancock confirmed to the committee that more than , NHS workers have now been tested for coronavirus, and admitted he would love to be able to wave a magic wand to increase supplies of personal protective equipment . MPs were also told that healthcare staff are genuinely concerned about the safety of patients being compromisedworkers are spread too thinly. Dr Alison Pittard, Dean at the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said: Weaposve had to spread ourselves more thinly and we have developed guidance to try and make sure that continues to be safe, butwe have to expand even more and spread ourselves even more thinly, there would be concern that safety could be compromised.  So everyone is working really well, weaposre doing everything that we can but staff are genuinely concerned. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, told the committee sick NHS workers are being forced to drive two hours away to be tested. She urged: We need some really clear direction on how we can access testing both in the NHS but more so for social care, because they donapost have the same infrastructure as the NHS. Prof Costello, a former British director at the World Health Organisation, said he was not sure we need , tests per day in realitywe can get this epidemic damped down and that it was more important to have the systems in place. How are they restructuring the public health teams  Have they got plans in place Will they need extra volunteers, for example He also suggested offering incentives to % of the population to stay socially isolated in order to get the economy going again. We have to get the economy going andit means locking down % of our population, even giving them incentives to stay in quarantine and with digital apps to help monitor their symptoms and give them support, thataposs the way to really keep this going until we get a vaccine and safe herd immunity.The committeeaposs chairman Jeremy Hunt later called for a massive ramp-up - not just in the testing, but also the tracing of everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the virus. He told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme: If weaposre going to be in a position where we can track and trace every single person who has Covid or might have had Covid in three weeksapos time, because thataposs when we could next potentially end the lockdown, well that is a huge logistical undertaking.

It comes as scientists from Oxford University said they were confident they could have a vaccine available by September.

The marquee, which has been built at a vehicle depot, can accommodate up to  bodies. It was completed earlier this week and contains six chilled containers that are covered by a large gazebo. Faith leaders and a humanist gathered for a ceremony today to offer thoughts and prayers for those who might need to use the site and their families during the pandemic. The event was also attended by Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees. Mr Rees said: “This is a dficult time for everyone in our city and we know the reason for building this place of rest is distressing for our communities. It’s important we take all preparations necessary so we can provide a dignied place to rest for citizens who sadly lose their lives during the Covid- pandemic. “Today’s event exemplied kindness, respect and dignity. It’s reassuring to see representatives from a range of faiths and non-faiths coming together today. I hope it gives some comfort to all our residents that we will do all we can to support each other through this dficult time. “We stand with people from all faiths and no faith because We Are Bristol together.” Hospitals across the UK have increased their general capacity for patients who died over the last few weeks but local councils have been working to be preparedfurther space is needed. This was one of the first times members of the public have been allowed inside. The council said they allowed dferent faiths from across the city to view the site as they wanted to be open and transparent about the preparations it was making. Representatives from dferent religions gave a prayer while a leading humanist also gave a reading to a small gathering inside.  Although no funeral services will take place at the site, Bristol City Council said it held the ceremony so faith and non-faith representatives can help bereaved people better understand the process. The council said it had been quickly established to ensure sufficient capacity to allow for dignity and respect to be maintained before funerals are held. Attendees at the event included The Bishop of Bristol Vivienne Faull virtually over Zoom, The Buddhist Chaplin at the University of Bristol, Sister Jinho, Humanist Celebrant Chrissie Hackett, and Zaheer Shabir, represented the Muslim community. A number of other faith leaders, unable to attend in person, also joined the ceremony by Zoom, including Rabbi Monique Mayer and Hindu representative, Shiv Sama. Restrictions will be in place at the site to protect staff who will be offered continued emotional support.  The site is not yet in use and Bristol City Council has written to neighbours around the site to keep them informed. The tented site is located off a residential street, but vehicles will reverse into a covered area to ensure all dignity is maintained. Those transporting the body would stop at an infection control point and the deceased would be transferred in the same way as a traditional mortuary to be stored in one of six refrigerated containers until they are removed for a funeral. There is a three pronged walkway for staff to use to ensure infection control and PPE wearing is carried out and strict instructions on following safety measures. Mortuary and coroneraposs support manager for Bristol City Council John Pitchers, said: The purpose-built facility is to ensure there is sufficient capacity to continue to look after the deceased in a way that ensures dignity and respect. We all hope it is never needed butit is, it is vital that we can continue to deliver the same care.  It is designed to be as close as possible to a traditional morgue. Within the containers are the same wrappers as in a permanent one. The procedures are all the same and anyone using it will be moved around with the same equipment. They are kept safe and the level of security is the same. It is essentially ready now but we are limited to the number of people we can accommodate until the racking is here which is due to arrive at the end of next week. Any deceased comes through the main door and there is strict infection control. The van reverses and the bodies are transferred into the temporary resting place. There is a three stage process for staff with walkways to ensure all safety measures are carried out. Bristol City Council said it originally purchased containers which could accommodate  deceased during usual operation. It has also ordered bespoke racking which could increase this capacityrequired, and decisions will be made later on according to levels of demand.

Stephen, , drove from Liverpool to Pendle Hill to climb a steep hill and was forced tohome by officers who found him in Barley on April .But Stephen has hit back after the ordeal, saying he needs exercise due to his high blood pressure to keep him off medication, reports the Liverpool Echo. At the time, Ribble Valley Police said: Today we have removed an inidual who thought it was okay to drive from Liverpool to Barley to walk up Pendle Hill. His justication for this was his local hills were ‘closed to the public’ and he needs to exercise as he has high blood pressure. This man was ill-equipped for the task and clearly not physically fit enough to tackle what was in front of him. It was below freezing this morning and whilst it was a beautully clear day he had no idea of the route terrain or direction back to his car once he had got to the top. If he made it all. No map, no compass, no fluids and no idea...However, Stephen believes the implementation of the government’s coronavirus emergency powers towards him was inappropriate. Speaking to the ECHO , Stephen, a civil engineer, said he suffers from hypertension and has only recently come off medication for the condition.He said: An essential and ongoing combination of weight loss and regular exercise has resulted in my being able to manage my hypertension without the need for prescribed medication. However, the regular exercise concerned consists of regularly walking steep inclines as I cannot run or jog due to cartilage problems in my left knee.  Previously, Stephen said he was travelling to Moel Famau and Loggerheads Park in North Wales once or twice a week to perform such exercise. But due to recent Covid- restrictions, these sites have temporarily closed, which Stephen says meant he had to venture to Pendle Hill in Lancashire instead. At the start of his walk, Stephen says he was flagged down my a marked police vehicle, who enquired whether he had parked his car on the road. Stephen said: I turned to address the officer and was met with an exclamation of stay back, don’t come any closer. I was about ten feet away from the officer at this point, who remained in the vehicle. I confirmed that the car on the road was mine. The officer then askedI had driven from Liverpool.  I was having trouble hearing the officer, due to the noise of the vehicle engine, and endeavoured to take up a position at the side of the vehicle, whilst maintaining an appropriate distance, so I could hear him better but was met with another caustic exclamation of don’t come any closer, I won’t tell you again. Stephen says he then explained to the officer his medical condition and how upon research Pendle Hill had not been identied as a closed site for visitors. Following a further conversation, Stephen says was he was asked to leave the area immediately. Stephen says he was left saddened by what he believes to be aposinappropriate and completely disproportionateapos behaviour of the police. He said: It was never my intention to obstruct the officer in the execution of his duties in any way, nor fail to comply with the officer’s subsequent appraisal of the situation.  I was simply conversing with the officer in an attempt to explain the overarching circumstances and convey the fact that I had in fact travelled a ‘reasonable distance’ to the nearest available location able to facilitate my health requirements via appropriate exercise. He added: I am an experienced climber who was appropriately dressed and profoundly familiar with Pendle Hill. New government guidelines released to police yesterday state driving to the countryside and walking, when far more time is spent walking than driving is a reasonable excuse to leave the house for. A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: We can confirm that we have received a complaint so it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment any further on this particular case at this time.

However, he appeared to downplay any link to the ongoing pandemic at the time, making no reference to it at a groundbreaking ceremony and instead linking its completion to a national holiday. But now it looks like the project might be rushed to completion even sooner.Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirrorAccording to state run media, builders are intent on completing construction “faster and better”, and are working “day and night” to get the hospital up and running. The report added that the “vicious” sanctions imposed by “hostile forces” to punish North Korea for its nuclear weapons programme were having no impact on progress. New images show that foundations had already been dug, concrete poured and metal structural supports installed.  In one photo construction can be seen continuing at night. The reason for the renewed urgency is not stated in the report, but experts agree that the building is coming together quickly. Martyn Williams and Peter Makoswky from North Korea watchdog,  North, analysed the project in satellite photos.  “Construction has continued at such pace that for the first time – after just under one month – the overall outline of the building is visible,” they wrote. “Commercial satellite imagery from April  shows clear outlines of the two towers that will dominate the rear of the hospital. “The rest of the building is also taking shape, including a distinctive lip that juts out from the front of the hospital.”  North Korea’s two closest neighbours have had tens of thousands of coronavirus cases, but the Kim regime says there has not been a single one within its borders. The claim cannot be independently veried in the closed-off country and has been met with scepticism.

As he approached the front door, Daniel said he spotted a man with ginger hair who looked familiar. “I recognised Harry first because I saw his red hair, but he didn’t say anything,” said Daniel.“Then I looked at Meghan and put it all together. “They both said here’s the food, hope you’re well. “I said, ‘Thank you’ and they handed the food over, then I did a double-take. “I didn’t say to them ‘Hey you’re the Royals’ or anything. “I think they’re wonderful, wonderful people and I am glad they are here in LA doing this.” The couple became involved in the project through Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, who has supported the charity and founder Marianne Williamson for many years.

The friend added: “She plans on volunteering much more with Harry and for the time being urged her mom to stay home and stay safe. “Doria is always wanting to help and be of service, so staying home can be a bit challenging.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles kind words shes","story":"NewsMeghan Markles kind words as shes seen in LA for first time wearing mask to deliver foodMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are now living in LA with their son Archie, and have been doing their bit to help people struggling during the coronavirus Covid- lockdownShareByChristopher BucktinUnited States EditorZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video harry-meghan-deliver-food-la-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news meghan-markles-kind-words-shes-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The couple wore facemasks and gloves as they dropped off packages on behalf of the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Project Angel Food to people with chronic illnesses. The couple, who were casually dressed in jeans, t-shirts, baseball caps and trainers, were caught on CCTV as they buzzed the front door at the Sierra Bonita Community Apartments in West Hollywood. The people they were delivering to had no warning of their famous helpers, and have revealed the kind words the couple said before handing over the food. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here The delivered food to two residents, including Daniel Tyrell, , who came down from his fourth-floor apartment to pick up the delivery at the main entrance. Daniel, who has HIV and issues with high blood pressure, said: “My phone rang and a lady said, ‘Hi this is Meghan from Project Angel Food.’ “I said, ‘Oh, do you want to meet me downstairs ’  “I didn’t realise it was THE Meghan at this point. “So I walked down the external staircase and I saw the two black SUVs on the road outside so I knew there was something gong on. “I went down to the front door to let them in. “I recognised him first because of his reddish hair.  “Then I looked at her and put it together. “Harry didn’t introduce himself or anything. “They both said here’s the food and thank you, hope you’re well and that you’re fine. “They handed the food over and I said thank you, too. “I didn’t let on about it, I didn’t want to make them uncomfortable or anything.  The couple arrived in their black SUV and were followed by another car containing their protection officers. However they approached the front door alone. Daniel added: To have someone come and deliver the food is amazing, it makes us here feel that somebody cares outside. “It’s also good for me and us here to have the people contact, too, because we’re here and self isolating. “So for Harry and Meghan to do this is amazing. “I have been a client of Project Angel Food for two years and I am on a blood pressure diet, which helps me. “There’s two or three people in the building that get for from them.  “The deliveries usually come at . in the morning on a Wednesday, so when I got told it was being delivered later I thought that was strange.” After announcing their plans to quit the royal family in January, the couple fled to Canada but have now moved to LA where they plan to set up home. They are in the process of setting up a new charity venture, however have said it wonapost launch until the time is right.  Speaking about having Meghan and Harry in the city, Daniel said: “You know, I hope they get a better reception here in LA than they have in the UK. “They’re doing a great thing and I for one am very grateful.” Benita Hood, who manages the building, took the day off to attend a physio appointment and was gutted to miss the royal visitors.  Benita said: “I can’t believe I took the day off! “Oh my God I can’t believe they came to my building. “Nobody knew they were coming, we had no idea. This building is named after me. “There was no alert or anything.

The droplets behave like an aerosol - a suspension of particles or droplets in air or another gas - and can penetrate deep into the lungs when they are breathed in, scientists found. A team from the US National Institutes of Health used a laser light-scattering experiment to demonstrate how droplets fill the air when a person speaks, and how masks can block them and prevent the spread of Covid-. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror.  The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Molecular biologist Dr Matthew Meselson, of Hard University, wrote: Certain persons called apossuper spreadersapos produce many more aerosol particles than other persons. These particles are too small to settle because of gravity, but they are carried by air currents and dispersed by dfusion and air turbulence. Inhaled aerosolised particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and infect cells in the alveoli, air sacs in the lungs which exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules to and from the bloodstream, the study found. The particles can be carried by drafts. Dr Meselson added: Aerosols from infected persons may therefore pose an inhalation threat even at considerable distances and in enclosed spaces, particularlythere is poor ventilation. The possible contribution of infective aerosols to the current pandemic suggests the advisability of wearing a suitable mask whenever it is thought that infected persons may be nearby and of providing adequate ventilation of enclosed spaces where such persons are known to be or may recently have been. The researchers said some studies have shown that the number of droplets produced by speaking is similar to the number produced by coughing.Masks can prevent the droplets from filling the air, the scientists said. A separate study in the New England Journal of Medicine in March found that aerosolised coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Kathrine Polak, a FOUR PAWS veterinarian, says that the shocking practice of eating dogs and cats carries the risk of new illnesses spreading. The unsanitary conditions associated with the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many dferent animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases, like COVID-, she said. The charity is urging governments to shut down cruel live animal markets, which it describes as ticking time bombs. It says that Phnom Penh, Cambodiaaposs capital, has a shocking  restaurants which serve up dog meat, which has been linked to cases of cholera, trichinella and rabies. But one seller says that in her community, it is believed that eating dogs can prevent colds and viral illnesses. It is claimed that doctors have been encouraging people that it is safe to eat as it is natural, without chemicals. Although Vietnam has a tradition of eating dog meat, Micheal Chour, founder of charity the Sound of Animals, says that the recent rise is also down to Chinese influence.  There was a big increase in the number of Chinese workers coming to the country and they have bought many of their practices along with them, he told the Sun. Many of those, such as torture, have been introduced here and people believe that because China is a big and powerful country, that we should be listening to these practices. Vietnam currently has has  cases of coronavirus while Cambodia has . Neither country has recorded any deaths from the flu-like virus. Wet markets where live animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls, have reopened across China. The Wuhan wet market, has been widely blamed as the source of the virus, which has killed thousands of people across the world.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities.

Fatemeh Khishvand, who became an Instagram star due to her alleged transformation, is said to be on a ventilator and fighting for her le at Sina Hospital in Tehran. The -year-old was detained in October last year amid a crackdown on Instagram celebrities, and faces charges including corruption on earth, encouraging youth to engage in lunacy, insulting the sacred” and “acquiring illicit income”, said activists calling for her release. Lawyers for Ms Khishvand, known on Instagram as Sahar Tabar, had begged a judge to free her due to Iranaposs coronavirus outbreak - the worst in the Middle East - but she was refused bail even though other prisoners have been released following similar concerns. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. Lawyer Payam Derafshan told the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran : “We find it unacceptable that this young woman has now caught the coronavirus in these circumstances while her detention order has been extended during all this time in jail. Ms Khishvand faces years in prison for engaging in peaceful freedom of expression on her personal Instagram account, the CHRI added. Iran has suffered one of the worst outbreaks with almost , cases and , deaths reported by Tehran and the country has been accused of grossly under reporting cases and deaths. A parliamentary report said the actual number might be almost twice as many and warned that up to  per cent of the Iranian population could test positive for Coovid-isolation measures are not implemented.  In a worst-case scenario, as many as , could diejust  per cent of containment measures are in place, the report added. Ms Khishvand became an Instagram star in  when she posted photos of her transformation. She claimed she had undergone  surgeries to look like Oscar-winning actress Ms Jolie, . But Instagram users dubbed her a zombie due to her hollow cheeks, upturned nose and gaunt appearance. But she later admitted she had achieved the look through the use of make-up and digital editing, and shared photos of her actual appearance. Her lawyer, Mr Derafshan, said Judge Mohammad Moghiseh repeatedly denied to release her on bail as the coronavirus outbreak worsened, and the judge is now unreachable. Mr Derafshan added: “It’s not the prison director’s fault that she’s behind bars. The responsibility rests with Mr Moghiseh.” Jail officials denied that she had caught the disease.  But Mr Derafshan said: “It seems like it has become a habit for the authorities to deny everything. “It makes no sense to deny this. The prison director should acknowledge the infection and admit she has been hospitalised.” He has called on Tehran to release Ms Khishvand and other prisoners who were detained on allegations of committing non-violent crimes.  He added: “Many women in Shahr-e Rey Prison have contacted my colleague and me about the terrible situation inside the prison and the fear that exists among the inmates [due to the coronavirus]. “We want the authorities to issue a general order to allow these prisoners to be temporarily released. In the absence of judges who are sick or not coming to work, this is the only solution.” The Iran Human Rights Monitor has described Shahre-rey, the prison where Ms Khishvand was detained, as the most dangerous and worst prison for women in the country due to its inhumane medical and psychological conditions.

It said the prison, also known as Qarchak, is located on a former industrial chicken farm in a desert east of Tehran, and falls far below the UNaposs rules for the treatment of prisoners. Inmates have complained of disgusting conditions such as contagious diseases, urine-stained floors, insufficient and filthy toilets, contaminated food, foul odours and a lack of ventilation.

British-Iranian mum Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe, , was among them. Her leave from Evin prison in Tehran was extended to Saturday as the Iranian Prosecutor General considers her plea for clemency. Ms Zaghari-Ratclfe, whose five-year-old daughter Gabriella has ed to London to be with dad Richard Ratclfe, has been staying at her parentsapos home in Iranaposscapital. She was ordered to wear an ankle tag and cannot go far from her parentsapos home.  In its most recent update, the Free Nazanin campaign said there was still no update on her appeal clemency. Her father was told to check in again on Saturday to find out whether her furlough would be extended again. One of her former cellmates was on a list of approved clemencies earlier this month. Iran, meanwhile, paraded disinfection vehicles, mobile hospitals and other medical equipment as it marked its national Army Day on Friday to underscore the militaryaposs role in battling the coronavirus pandemic which has hit the country hard.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This was a highly unusual end to the season, to say the least, and not the one any of us would have preferred, but all three deserve enormous credit for their performances over the course of the season.“With the turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Covid- outbreak, there was always going to be a highly-charged and passionate debate about how we secure the future of Scottish football.“It is no exaggeration to say that this was an existential matter for Scottish clubs, with many of them telling us they were at real risk of going under unless the situation was resolved very quickly, so I’m pleased that the game has moved decisively.“Whilst more than % of clubs agreed with the directors’ written resolution, it’s clear that others were strongly opposed.“There has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward and I now call on all  clubs to move forward in a constructive and positive way.”SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster also had his say on tonight’s development.He said: “Prior to this positive result, we were unable to make the vital end-of-season payments, which will provide a leline to so many clubs in the lower isions.

JustGiving page, setting her off on a flying start on her -day challenge to run almost k every day.The Scotstown Primary pupil has previously taken on km junior fun-runs in Duthie Park – but has never taken on a test of endurance quite like this.Her mother says she is immensely proud of her daughter, and believes her determined character will see her through to the final run.Carly Tuckwell said: “Frankie has seen so much on the news about the NHS and she just decided she wanted to do something to help, so we came up with this idea.“It’s a km run in  days and it’s a doable amount for her, as it’s just under k a day.“I’m saying it’s doable, but it’s a fair distance for an eight-year-old to run.”Her fundraising page has already surpassed its original £ target.Carly said: “I think she’s still running on a high from it all because on the Monday she was really excited to go and start her challenge, and on the Tuesday we woke up and she had £ of donations overnight.“She’s really chuffed with herself.”Each day, the pair plan their route and head outdoors to bring themselves one step closer to completing Frankie’s -day goal.While running, Carly says they look out for rainbows in windows, painted in support of the NHS, which she says makes their runs more exciting.She said: “I’m so proud.“I just think it’s an amazing thing to do, and to raise the money and to even commit to doing that distance every day.“It’s great for an eight-year-old and she’s definitely determined to make sure she finishes it all.”She continued: “Her dad has promised he is waiting till the very last day to donate to keep her going, so she’s really determined.”Frankie hopes she will be able to visit paramedics at the Scottish Ambulance Service depot in Aberdeen.Carly said: “It will be nice to show her where the money is going, I think that would be really sweet.”Frankie added: “When I go out for a run it is a bit tiring but it’s worth it because I want to raise money for the NHS.“I would love the chance to meet the paramedics after the lockdown and get a chance to go inside an ambulance, and press the sirenthey let me.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53432748-240x180.jpg

I’d like Dundee United coming up, I’d like Inverness, I’d like Hearts to stay in the league.“If you had those big clubs in the league it would be good for the league.“For ourselves we’ve missed going to Dundee and Dundee United as those grounds are ones we like visiting as we take big crowds and they are games you want to be involved in.“Even Inverness, when they were in the league, although it was not the best of journeys, the games attracted a good support and they were good games as well.“It’s outwith my control and it’s down to the league but I’d like Dundee, Inverness and Dundee United in the league for sure.“You’re playing more teams but the league want Rangers playing Celtic four times a season as it has more people watching and it benefits the other teams in the league as well.“It attracts money into the game and helps the other teams outwith Celtic and Rangers but it’s the league’s decision.“I’m surethe league wants everything done right and as much money as possible they will want Celtic and Rangers playing each other as much as they can.“Having  or  teams in the league may hinder that in their eyes.”McGinn has been keeping himself busy during lockdown by training as well as helping Aberdeen’s Community Trust with phone calls to check on supporters.He has also been helping the trust with deliveries of food.The -year-old has been following developments this week with the lower league seasons declared over.McGinn has sympathy for those teams negatively impacted by the decision.He added: “It’s a tough situation to be in, even in the lower leagues where Falkirk are a point behindand Partick Thistle had a game in hand and a chance to move off the bottom of thetable.“You definitely feel sorry for the players there and the fact they didn’t get to fulfil their fixtures.“If you are in mid-table and not challenging or fighting relegation it is perhaps an easier decision to make but you do feel sorry for the teams who will be affected the most.”June  is the earliest clubs in Scotland will be able to resume training and it will be even longer before matches .McGinn reckons, following the extended lay-off, everyone will appreciate football more when it eventually s.He said: “We won’t take things for granted. We appreciate how much football and sport means to everyone.“We go out trying to win every game and fans will always be serious and passionate about their sport.“But everyone being able to watch their team win, lose or draw, can do so with a smile on their face.“There are games we won’t win but we have to come away happy we’re still able to play.“It’s times like now that you definitely appreciate when you were playing and whether it is three games a week we play you just want to be out there playing.“It will feel strange coming back after a long break not playing.“But I will appreciate things a lot more and hopefully we can attract more fans to help out the league and the inidual clubs.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs we have highlighted in the paper over the past few weeks, the response of the public in the coronavirus crisis has been superb.People generally have abided by government advice to stay at home.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer. This includes our Annual Dog Show in May which is one our biggest fundraising events.\"We are hopeful that not all staff go down with virus at same time.\"We are managing the situation to the best of our ability and [despite] that our weekly income has reduced very signicantly, and we need people to donate to help keep our centre operational whilst our shops are closed.\"All our animals are still being looked after and cared for by our excellent and committed staff.\"Sonia Graham from Borders Greyhound Rescue added: \"Were trying to make the best of the situation.\"We have  dogs at the moment because we cant get dogs in or out. Its dficult.\"Weve had some under fostering, but unless they are greyhound people they wont be going to foster.\"Its frustrating because for people who want dogs, youd think this was the perfect time to have one as theres time for one-on-one training.\"And a lack of volunteers is a key factor in the dficulties facing the Greyhound Rescue now, with the charity normally taking in up to  regular helpers to care for  dogs.\"Without volunteers, its been a real struggle,\" said Sonia. \"Were family-run and we have a farm too, so were just trying to fill the gaps left by volunteers.\"Another problem which has reared its head for Sonia and her family is the knock-on effect of this lockdown.Sonia explained: \"People who may have lost jobs or their business, they wont be thinking of taking on an animal.\"People cant afford to pay vet bills. I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in.

He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars.

Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad. Be honest when ministers get stuff wrong, or when they donrsquot know the answer to something. Be up front when the system is struggling to cope tell us what work is being done to remedy failures and give us a realistic assessment of whether the action will be successful.:Home Secretary lsquosorrypeople feel there have been failings over PPE supplyrsquoWe badly need a new, more direct approach, particularly from the UK Government, one that is better able to encompass the eye-popping statistics and harsh truths created by coronavirus.The current information vacuum grows more worrying by the day. After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable. And thatrsquos how you end up with the likes of Home Secretary Priti Patel, the coldest fish this side of Greenland, issuing a textbook  apology ndash ldquoIrsquom sorryYOU feel there are failings ndash at a recent daily briefing. This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

That the arrogance of this post-imperial country, with its delusions of Global Britain, led the UK elite to ignore the threat of Covid- until it was too late.Many Scottish nationalists feel much the same and say that Scotland has been harnessed to inept policies fashioned by a grossly incompetent Tory clique in Westminster.If only we could have closed the border with England, they sigh, looking at the way Jacinda Ardern has handled things in New Zealand, where the disease appears to have been stamped out by a total lockdown. At least for now.Reports that English firms had been declining requests from Scottish care homes for protective gear only confirm the suspicion that Scotland is a low priority, at the back of the queue, an afterthought.The SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is by no means alone in believing that Scotland would be better ldquodealing with [our] own problems unfettered..[like]Norway, Ireland. Many MSPs are saying so privately, and wondering why Nicola Sturgeon is not distancing herself from the ldquolaissez faire approach of the English Tories.It was certainly possible that Scotland could have taken a dferent path to the rest of the UK. Smaller countries like Iceland and Singapore moved faster in locking down against Covid . Ireland closed the schools earlier than we did and seems to have been much better at suppressing the disease. Certainly the crude death rate has been around half the UKrsquos.But there is a problem: throughout this crisis there has been no signicant dference between Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach to coronavirus and that of the other three nations in the four-nation pandemic alliance. SNP MPs may say that the Scottish Government was press-ganged into backing the UK approach to handling Covid- and that her instinct was to go for a much tougher lock down earlier. However, there is no basis for thinking this.When Leo Varadkar made his dramatic announcement on March  closing the schools in Ireland, the First Ministerrsquos response was that this was unnecessary. She said she agreed with her own medical advisers that the disease would likely be spread just as readily by children at home, and that the emergency services would be undermined by parents having to stay at home to look after their kids.As for testing, this was actually stopped by the Scottish Government in mid March. As the National Clinical Director, Professor Jason Leitch, told Channel  on March , ldquocommunity testing and contact-tracing was halted after the containment phase. The First Minister was fully aware of this. On April , standing next to Ms Sturgeon, the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said that testing was ldquoa distraction. This seemed to be a general view among UK medical advisers.Ms Sturgeon has said that she ldquofollowed the science. This has been the mantra used by ministers like the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, since this outbreak began. Many commentators regard this as a convenient excuse for incompetence. ldquoWhy didnrsquot they listen to dferent scientists and the World Health Organisation who were advising countries to test, test, test But Britain has some of the best epidemiologists in the world sitting on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies. The UK Chief Scientic Adviser, Professor Patrick Vallance, said again yesterday that ldquoI donrsquot think it is quite right that testing saves lives. Our medics still believe that tests should be confined to people who have symptoms and to essential workers. Mass testing will only make sense in their view when there is a reliable antibody test ndash and there isnrsquot one.Yet, testing and contact-tracing seems to have worked where, not just in South Korea, but in Germany where the death rate has been signicantly lower. Critics like Professor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, insist that the Scottish Government could and should have embarked on mass testing, though itrsquos not clear how it could have found the capacity so to do.She also claims that Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon adopted a ldquoherd immunity strategy because of ldquoBritish exceptionalism. Herd immunity has morphed into an ideological battle-ground, rather than an epidemiological truism.The problem for politicians like Ms Sturgeon is that they are expected to base their policy on ldquothe science, listen to the ldquoexperts, and make policy ldquoevidence based. But as soon as they do so, they are liable to be accused of listening to the wrong kind of scientists.Epidemiologists take a long view about the progress of a disease through its le-cycle involving several peaks and troughs. They have said from the start that since there is no vaccine,  per cent of us are going to get the disease anyway so there is no way of stopping it. That was one of the first remarks Ms Sturgeon made about Covid-.It is what the top UK advisers, like Professor Vallance meant when they were talking about herd immunity. In the absence of a vaccine, they believed that the only way the disease would die out would be when most of us were exposed to it. Prof Leitch was adamant on March  that : ldquothe alternative ndash closing the borders and locking everyone down ndash doesnrsquot work over a prolonged period.Thatrsquos as may be, but it now looks asthe politically savvy thing to have done was to ignore all this and go for a panic lockdown to show the voters that you are serious. In politics, doing something is always more appealing than not doing something.Scientists donrsquot have to answer to Twitter. The political cycle is not on the same trajectory as this disease, and politicians will get no credit for being right in a couple of yearsrsquo time.Shops across Scotland are closing.

Top of it was a bottle of whisky, which entailed waiting for the cordon to be lted from the alcohol shelves at ten orsquoclock sharp. In my tweed coat and Alice-band I probably embody the profile of a rural alcoholic. Trying not to look desperate or furtive only made it worse.Whisky isnrsquot my tipple, but among my first thoughts ahead of the lockdown was to ensure we had enough wine to see us through. The problem, of course, is how to define enough. Judging by the spike in wine deliveries across the UK in March, many were equally eager to lay down a cellar ndash or in our case a boiler cupboard ndash for the troublesome times ahead. During the stampede, an Edinburgh friend reported that it wasnrsquot toilet roll she was having dficulty sourcing but tonic water, as the capital prepared to self-isolate with gin.Can alcohol be classed as necessary  Not by any medical standard of nutritional value. Yet for those living with ever-rising levels of anxiety, you could make a case that, as an aid to relaxing, and in creating a semblance or chimera of normality, it is as vital as vitamin C.It probably goes without saying that one personrsquos essential is anotherrsquos treat. Income plays some part in what we consider crucial to keep body and soul together. Yet beyond the basic and inarguable provisions for making decent meals and keeping the household clean, where exactly is the line that distinguishes justiable consumption from self-indulgence  And who is in a position to judge one from the other  On a scale of one to , for instance, how do ice-cream or pimento-stuffed olives score  Are beef burgers or pizzas the wisest way to eat, or could a police officer confiscate these and insist we replace them with broccoli and wild salmon Most worrying of all, for me at least, is whether we should be abstaining from olive oil, the ingredient without which no dinner in our house is considered complete, and replacing it with a local equivalent, thereby avoiding air miles, and supporting our own economy  If so, what would that stand-in be ndash dripping or lard While the police thankfully did a U-turn on its threat to put our shopping under surveillance, it will have made some of us considerably more self-conscious as we feed our goods onto the conveyor belt. I never normally give it a thought, but now Irsquoll be worrying what antisocial habits my trolley reveals.Doubtless the contents of most baskets would not cause an officer to pause for a nanosecond, unless they included a box of party invitations and enough barbecue coals to fuel a power station. But now the issue has been raised, it makes you re-evaluate every purchase.After rummaging through my wardrobe, I can probably get through to the end of the year without buying anything  other than plimsolls. By December I might be looking a little shabby, but thatrsquos hardly news. And, since mending and making do is enjoying a comeback, others will presumably be in much the same state.If nothing , this enforced stasis offers the space to reflect on how often what we buy is surplus to requirement. Compost bins and landfill must be groaning under the weight of food whose sell by date, like one of Douglas Adamsrsquos deadlines, whooshed by ages ago. Last week a neighbour discovered self-raising flour among her long-lost ingredients at the back of the cupboard and, after checking for weevils, enjoyed a baking spree with some equally ancient dried yeast. Going through his chest of drawers, my husband came upon a lovely unworn jumper of mine that is at least a decade old, but looks brand new. That I hadnrsquot noticed its absence speaks for itself.What previously felt like must-haves now simply suggest a reflex. The act of repeatedly reaching out and purchasing says more about a magpie urge to acquire than any critical shortage. This is not a puritanical call to give up the worldly or frivolous or, when the good times , to eschew the pleasures of things that, strictly speaking, we could get by without. Tens of thousands of businesses, artists and companies would be bankruptedwe adopted an ascetic lestyle that pared everything to the bone. In fact, when finally we unlock, we will actively need to help cash-strapped outfits and iniduals get back on their feet.As Europe takes its initial tentative steps towards easing restrictions, the notion of what is indispensable to daily existence moves beyond the hypothetical to something more profound. In some parts of Italy, bookshops, stationers and stores selling childrenrsquos and baby clothes are now being allowed to open, under strict conditions. In Austria, meanwhile, garden centres and hardware shops are back in business.These highly specic priorities are revealing of each nationrsquos personality. And while some would refute the idea that books or plants are anything other than accessories, Irsquod go to the barricades to defend both as central to survival. After sustenance and medication, we need a reason to exist beyond merely ticking over. The proleration of good bookshops in Italy shows its reverence for literature, a cultural bias that is confirmed by this decision. Perhaps the authorities recognise that, while enforced incarceration is likely to continue for some time, people must be allowed to feed their minds and imaginations as well as their stomachs.The same goes for gardening, which is a universal expression of the desire to nurture and grow. Such is the over-abundance of stock in garden centres and nurseries right now, getting the tills ringing makes economic sense as well as offering a glimmer of light at the end of the polytunnel.Shops across Scotland are closing.

Even with thoughts of lugging heavy panniers full of day-to-day necessary detritus.Even knowing Id have to scrap with private hire drivers at junctions and dodge buses in cycle lanes.Thats a large part of the current joy. No scrapping, no narrow misses, no stress.The roads are so much emptier that the nagging fear always following at my shoulder, that heightened sense of potential doom, is gone.There are streets so quiet on my route that you can almost forget about motorised traffic and freewheel, carefree up the middle of the road. It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

A death begets a byelection. Crises, however grim, can be opportunities.So it was quite a surprise to see the SNP come over all prim and prissy this week about discussing independence in relation to the coronavirus.The prompt was Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw joining the dots between the two as he looked ahead to the  Holyrood election.ldquoI think it will look ridiculousthe first debate that the Nationalist movement want to have when we get to the other side of this is lsquoLetrsquos go gung ho for independence next yearrsquo, then more fool themthey do, he told the PA news agency.ldquoI think the public will look at that and say lsquoAre you kidding rsquoHe then twisted the dirk by observing Scotland was being helped through the outbreak by the UKrsquos ldquoeconomic resilience and strength.The SNPrsquos reaction to this was to try to shut down the debate entirely, a sure sign Mr Carlaw had drawn blood.ldquoThe last thing any Scottish politician on any side of the constitutional debate should be doing is trying to use the appalling crisis we all currently face as an argument for or against independence, the party gasped.Obviously, therersquos a calculation to be made about how far to venture into regular politics during the pandemic.The public has lost much of its appetite for the previous argy-bargy.But for the party of independence to echo Theresa May and say now is not the time to argue for its cause at all Well, that was a moment.Becauseever there was a time for the SNP to talk about independence - at least to itself - it is surely right now.Its previous case for leaving the UK, of a healthier economy creating a fairer society, is being dismantled by Covid-. Not speaking up would be a dereliction of the partyrsquos mission.The First Minister, as the tireless face of Scotlandrsquos response to the emergency, is an understandable exception. But for the Yes movementrsquos sake, she cannot be the rule.SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil had the right idea. He simply ignored the injunction from party HQ and tweeted that it was good Mr Carlaw brought up independence, as it let the SNP government mention it too and ldquohighlight that dealing with your own problems unfettered... is better.Regardless of whether you agree with his point, it made perfect sense for Mr MacNeil to make it, to keep saying what he believes in, and not cede the floor to his opponents.He could see Mr Carlaw wasnrsquot squeamish about a Unionist argument based on Covid-. That reference to the UKrsquos economic resilience and strength was a straw in the wind.Come the  election, the Tories, Labour and LibDems will be arguing that the Union, far from being an abstract anachronism, proved its worth in this crisis. That when it really mattered, Westminster broke the emergency glass at the Treasury and hosed the country with money. That the insurance policy paid out.People will of course argue over the many failings, about testing, PPE and the threadbare state of the NHS and the welfare state going into this.But the key message from the Unionist side, like it or loathe it, will be that the four-nations of the UK pulled together and got things done.And while there were regional tweaks, Scotland was a core part and beneficiary of that collective effort. Go ask its Nationalist First Minister.That argument is what the Yes movement, with its garlands of rosy hypotheticals, now has to overcome.It must rethink its own arguments - not its beliefs, but its messages to the unpersuaded - and it needs to get a sht on. Above all, it needs to say how a fledgling state can take off in the worst recession in a century.For what goes into the next white paper on independence now It was supposed to be rooted in Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission, the SNPrsquos economic blueprint for a new Scotland.Itrsquos not Mr Wilsonrsquos fault he didnrsquot factor in a pandemic. But it has made much of his work redundant.Its research on how small countries can prosper is salvageable. But his calculations for the first decade of independence - based on long-term growth of .%, halving a deficit of %, keeping debt below % of GDP - look like bygones of a dferent era.As the report said, persuading No voters about the economics of independence will need ldquoclear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.But as wersquove learned, no plan survives contact with coronavirus, and economic plans least of all.That particular pillar of the SNPrsquos case has now crumbled. The longer the crisis goes on, the more pages in the old prospectus will turn blank.The one thing that could yet change the dynamic is Brexit. If the UK government refuses to extend trade talks with the EU in light of coronavirus and brings about a hard lurch to WTO terms in the depths of a recession, it will squander any credit it is accumulating at present, and remind a lot of Scottish voters why they wanted to wave Westminster goodbye.However the current refusal to change course probably owes more to the absence of the only Tory who can sell an extension to Leave voters than dogmatism. Only once the Prime Minister s from convalescence can a pragmatic position prevail.Eventhe PM sticks to his original mad timetable, Ms Sturgeon cannot rely on it tipping the case for independence. She needs a new pitch as well.Her announcement yesterday of an economic recovery advisory group acknowledged that. Despite insisting she has no time for party politics right now, she said the new group would plan how to build a ldquofairer, greener and more equal society after Covid-, a clear nod to independence.It will be instructive to see how many politicians she sprinkles among the economists and business leaders to help steer it in that direction.God knows, she needs something to go right for her cause just now."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-kate-forbes-defends-scottish-governments-generous-business-support","story":"Earlier this week, the Scottish Government announced that emergency funding will now be handed out by property, rather than by business - similar to the model used by the UK Government.But small business rate payers will only be eligible for a % grant on all subsequent properties.In Wales and England, all small business properties are eligible for % of the pound, grant.During Holyroodrsquos first virtual membersrsquo questions session, Conservative finance spokesperson, Donald Cameron, quizzed Ms Forbes over the ldquopartial u-turn.:Scottish ministers unveil virus grants U-turnHe said: ldquoWhen the Scottish Government has decided to delay ious policy initiatives such as aspects of social security and early years nursery expansion, as a result of coronavirus, surely the Cabinet Secretary could reallocate funding within the Scottish Governmentrsquos own budget to improve support for business.But Ms Forbes rebutted Mr Cameronrsquos suggestion.She said: ldquoIf Donald Cameron can identy where he believes I should remove money from in terms of either businesses that have received money here that havenrsquot received it in the rest of the UK - or where and how I should ert that funding from frontline services, I would be intrigued in the answer.ldquoWe have exceeded the funding consequential for business, we have topped that up with our own support.

But the behaviour results in too many people arriving in locations that have less resources to deal with an increase in patients, who need specialist and often intensive care facilities.Scottish communities angrily reacted to the influx in visitors - some resorting to barricading lay-bys and would-be camping areas - warning that their already-under pressure local health services cannot cope with the extra strain.Last month, a military aircraft was needed to transport a critically-ill coronavirus patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.This led to the Scottish Government announcing that ferries services were now to only be used for islanders, allowing them to continue essential journeys.Even before the official lockdown was put in place, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told accommodation providers to stop accepting bookings - a message reiterated ahead of what would have been the Easter holidays.A Scottish Government spokesperson, said: ldquoWe need everyone to stay at home to help us save lives and protect our NHS.\"We also need businesses to help us achieve this.

The US tour has been postponed though at the time of writing the Hampden gig is still going ahead as planned. What definitely hasnrsquot been affected by the coronavirus pandemic is Cinnamonrsquos new album, The Bonny, the follow-up to  debut Erratic Cinematic, which topped the iTunes charts. The Bonny was released yesterday through his own Little Runaway Records. ldquoItrsquos probably not smart to release during a lockdown when the shops are closed and everyonersquos isolating, he said, ldquobut no chance Irsquom letting folk down.Opening track Canter is a well-established live favourite and two other tracks from it, Where Wersquore Going and Sun Queen, already have  million Spoty plays between them.

By  he was performing on his own as Gerry Cinnamon at pro-independence events and had recorded Hope Over Fear, a rousing anthem for the movement. He gave up the series of jobs he had had since leaving school ndash among them scaffolder, joiner and chef ndash and honed his sound playing at Open Mic and Jam Nights at the Priory bar on Sauchiehall Street. Word of mouth seems to have done the rest. Although technically unsigned when he announced that he would play two nights at the Barrowland in , tickets sold out in hours. The same thing happened two years earlier when a Facebook post alerted fans to a date at the cityrsquos O Academy on Sauchiehall Street.Following that gig, Cinnamon gave a rare interview to Glasgow Liversquos Christopher McQuade.ldquoThe only reason Irsquom in this game is because itrsquos full of imposters ruining music and my very existence annoys them and it pleases me, he said then. ldquoIf yoursquore a working class musician hearing this or reading it and you respect the art of song-writing more than the art of pretending, then you have a responsibility to get involved.

Having listened to an accused recite his version of events, Irvine Smith leaned forward and told him: ldquoYou are a fecund liar.ldquoOh no Irsquom not, said the accused. ldquoIrsquom telling the f***ing truth!High dudgeonTHERE appears to be no bounds to the allergy your average Celtic fan has to anything remotely connected with Rangers. We heard of one Hoops fan on a construction site who hated using the  lt because it was made by a company called Alimac. This meant it was an Alimac hoist.A light-ly storyA LANARKSHIRE father told us of the time his daughter noticed her car was low on petrol as she drove home. Ten minutes later she was stopped by the polis and asked why, at pm, she was driving without lights. She replied: ldquoIrsquom almost out of petrol so I switched off the lights to save fuel.Thistle do nicelyWE recall the advert for a shortbread mould that read: ldquoOur eight-inch shortbread mould is expertly hand-carved in Scotland with a pineapple mot. The traditional symbol of welcome and friendship. The pineapple mot, on closer inspection, looked awfy like a thistle.Ch-ch-ch changesTHE Diary has always had a penchant for detailing the dramatic changes in Glasgow over the past few decades. For instance, a while back no self-respecting Glesga journalist would use a word like penchant.Another example. A proud Glaswegianrsquos girlfriend used to be called Senga and she was a waitress in the works canteen. Nowadays shersquos called Miranda and shersquos a drama student who works part-time as a waitress with an outside catering company who provide on-location buffets for the BBC.Eveningrsquos entertainmentANOTHER of our favourite stories about the comedian Chic Murray, who was famous for his conversations with his doctor. ldquoTell me, asked the GP, ldquoAre you disturbed by improper thoughts during the night ldquoNo, Chic replied. ldquoI actually enjoy them.Menu minus mini munchersA SCOT on holiday in Winchester was severely molested by mysterious insects in the hotel garden.

Both Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were at pains to stress in their daily briefings that a precipitate easing of restrictions could endanger the progress that has been made, and waste the enormous sacrices that have already been made by so many.They were right, too, to resist calls for a timetable on possible changes. If, as all the UKrsquos governments have accepted thus far, policy is guided by the science, it would be foolhardy to assume that the worst is past until there are solid grounds for believing matters are under control.At best, we may have done enough to slow transmission, to buy time for the NHS to prepare, and to ready infrastructure to deal with this deadly disease. The questions that remain over the availability of PPE, or reliable testing, or other less urgent supply chains indicate we cannot yet be sure even of that.Unless and until a vaccine is developed and ready for distribution, every countryrsquos response to the coronavirus has been one of containment alone: the disease will not go away. A premature end to lockdown could make matters worse ndash and psychologically, it will be much harder to reintroduce necessary measures once they have been loosened.Butwe should not expect a firm timetable for the reopening of schools, factories or shops, we can at least enquire what the current thinking is on the criteria that will allow such decisions to be made. That mightinclude a combination of factors: confident assessment that the number of deaths each day is falling, widespread reliable testing to see who may have immunity, or certainty that capacity for treatment is not under the colossal strain that has existed to date. And it will not be ato the status quo ante it is much more likely to be limited opening of businesses or services with distancing enforced.To obtain accurate information on the disease and its toll, to assist the front-line staff and volunteers who have received less support than their tireless work deserves, and for reasons of basic humanity, we also need to focus much more on care homes and areas of the system other than intensive care. Badges showing support for carers are not a bad idea, but they are a token, not a comprehensive solution.Similarly, it is not to belittle the efforts of fundraisers such as Captain Tom Moore, to say that their hugely impressive contributions need to be lined up against the cost of this crisis. There will need to be a detailed description of how the economy can restructure unprecedented government subsidy is welcome, but must be effectively directed ndash particularly for the poorest, and for small to medium businesses, on whom recovery will depend. We should not underestimate the damage caused, nor forget that ultimately it will need to be paid for.All of this will depend upon clinical advice, and balancing the wider benefits and hazards of a continued isolation policy. We accept that the data may alter approaches or priorities, but it is reasonable to expect a general outline of the circumstances that may indicate whether ato ndashnot normality ndash a less strict regime is possible.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

No government has given reason to hope that the present lockdown will be eased, for any group, any time soon.We need young people to keep the economy going and I for one would be ready to continue to stay in lockdownI knew that parents could resume a more normal le and little children could access the locked play parks again.Can we not agree that those in good health, those who are tasked to build all our futures be allowed to have their lives less restricted  By all means ask them to be careful, maintain social distancing wherever possible and restrict access to older people. Or must everyone follow the diktats of those who probably have never lived in a high-rise tenement with children indoors for as much as  out of  hours a day  We are not all suffering equally, as usual it is the poorest, most vulnerable in society who suffer most in a crisis.Kay Gall, Edinburgh EH.SOMETIMES, when as a child I asked where was my father, I would be told that \"he is sitting with someone\", from which I knew he was with a person who was doing that strange-to-me thing, dying. As an elder in our Welsh chapel he had a certain way with him to comfort people. People, of all religious beliefs round our home area would say \"send for Elwyn\" and he would keep the \"night watch\". Then be at work the next day.When it was his time to die, he was at my home so my late husband, my mother and I were there for the weeks of his last illness. Even when he was dying my mother always shared their bed and he was never alone. The doctor and district-nurse were constant presences. His last day, as I was at work, I was phoned and broke the sound barrier to get home to be with him. I lay on his bed, held his hand and whispered. He always knew that I loved him, as he loved me. My splendid old dad.The last few paragraphs of the article by Professor Andrew Elderreally struck a chord. I can live with myself because I was at my fathers dying and he knew that we all loved him he was not alone. My daughters suicide,  years ago, meant she was totally alone, I could not be with her so the pain and grief are never-ending. Prof Elder is quite right when he says: \"We can find ways to allow families to be together at this time\". Surely that is possible Thelma Edwards, Kelso.I WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with Alan Simpson about the increasing number of people, with no medical qualications, claiming to have the right answer to the Covid- pandemic . I might add the increasingly annoying TV channel interviewers, who seem totally unable to listen to clear answers, given to their increasingly repetitive questions.As a retired GP, I am sure they will all soon perfect the use of an instrument which I found regularly to be  per cent successful: the retrospectoscope.Stuart Holms, Ayr.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

College biology lecturer Lisa di Meo manages the Zombie Science project at the University, and also plays a theoretical zombiologist.ldquoOur strength is in our mixture of skills, making for high-quality, professional productions that are funny but also provoke the audience to think and ask questions, added Professor OrsquoDell, who delivers lectures on genetics during the show and also plays a victim who is bitten but survives, as he is immune to the zombie virus.The lectures from the lsquoworldrsquos leading zombieism research facilityrsquo are aimed at those aged -. They include Brain of the Dead, Worst Case Scenario, and Genes of the Damned, in which you can discover who is most likely to become a zombie, contemplate the ethics of dealing with the infected, and decide how stem cells might be used to treat survivors.ldquoWe try to make people think about the consequences of an outbreak and about the ethics of decision-making, said Professor OrsquoDell,ldquoThese ethical questions are relevant today ndash do you quarantine a cruise ship with a few cases, exposing everyone on the ship to the disease so you keep whole cities safe from the virus  We also look at the stigma attached to the infected and the so-called super spreaders.ldquoAs the coronavirus spreads, itrsquos one of the few times that I have sympathy with politicians as they can only make the wrong decision ndash therersquos always a downside whatever they do.The lectures include apparently real CCTV recordings of a zombie outbreak at the University. Topics include the human brain and how damage could lead to zombiesrsquo insatiable appetites antibiotic resistance how diseases affect people dferently and how to stay safe during an outbreak, with a demonstration on effective hand washing using a gel that shows up under UV light.ldquoIf a research seminar and a pantomime had a baby it would be this show. Itrsquos story-led teaching through comedy that is fun and rowdy with lots of laughter, but there are some real take-home messages, said OrsquoDell.ldquoPeople are hooked on zombies because we are all interested in death and therersquos something appealing about the idea you can come back to le.ldquoThe zombie apocalypse is a useful hook as it encourages people to think more objectively about the consequences of contagion and ethical dilemmas. For example, we take a vote on whether you would kill a zombie or try to treat them and find a cure.ldquoWe are seeking further funding to go into schools and meanwhile our team of theoretical zombiologists is available to deliver science communication shows about biomedical science and the dangers of a zombie apocalypse at any event to anyone that will listen."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmA call for urgent changes to the planned support for self-employed people has been made by Orkney and Shetland MP, Alistair Carmichael. “This week I am challenging the Chancellor to do more for the self-employed,# said Mr Carmichael, today, Friday. #It is obvious now that the measures announced to date are not sufficient and that [hellip]copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is the eventual way out of this.#Professor Pennington, who has chaired E.coli outbreak inquiries and in , was awarded a CBE for services to microbiology, believed the system could then be recreated on a large scale in other health board areas of Scotland.#The islands have good medical facilities, but you would need to have good and effective testing facilities in place with a quick result. It would not cost a lot of money.“It would be an example for the rest of the country as long as there was an early warning system in place. It could then be possible for the Highlands and Grampian to follow.#Hotspots will not last because people will either recover or sadly die. So we have to think of how we are going to get out of this.#Overall cases need to come down substantially — by about ten times — for the lockdown to be lted throughout the country. That is why we need test beds where levels are already low.#The virus has been spreading under the radar into places like care homes, presumably by workers who were unaware they were infected. The testing needs ramping up. The best you can say overall is that it is not now out of control, but we do not yet have control over it.#Professor Pennington, who has also been appointed by the Scottish Police Federation as a coronavirus advisor, warned that a vaccine will reduce the number of COVID- deaths, but will not offer complete protection or eradicate the virus.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us. However old your photo is, as long as it has a picture of a puffin with food in its beak, and you know when and where it was taken, it will help.“Those who join the Puffarazzi are filling key gaps in our knowledge, helping us to understand what threats are facing these little seabirds. This is the first critical step to determining how to save them and ensure theyto our coasts for years to come.”Find out more about the project at: rspb.org.uk projectpuffincopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Actions by the Scottish Government are welcome but an integrated approach is needed.“In recent weeks I have spoken with self-employed people across the isles, representing every walk of le, and their message to the government could not be clearer: it is time for a rethink. Almost half of self-employed people are worried that they will not be able to cover basic costs like rent and bills.“We have learned that only two per cent of businesses have been able to access government-backed loans since they were introduced last month.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime.

We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy.

The couple share their Kensington Road home of  years with around  teddy bears of all shapes and sizes, collected over the past few decades.Having been encouraged by their four grandchildren, the couple came up with quirky presentations of the bears on their lawn, which is putting smiles on many faces, both young and old.In a bid to banish the boredom during their own self-isolation, Morrisand Jennyare keeping busy by meticulously arranging their daily displays, swapping bears in and out, giving their teddies dferent props, or moving them around the corner of the front garden.Behind it all is Jenny#s lelong love of teddy bears - she still has her very first bear Ted, given to her when she was just  months old. Morris did all the buying of the bears when he used to travel a lot for business, Jenny said.For  years he would always bring back a Harrods bear from London and they all sit on the stairs of our house. It became a tradition that when he would go away, he brought back a bear. Our kids and my brothers and sisters all bought bears for me down the years for Christmas and birthdays so we have accumulated a lot over the years.Alongside Brown Thomas bears sit several Paddingtons and others purchased at Aston Villa, Derby County, Wimbledon and ious Northern Ireland away games. Morris, however, called a halt to the bear buying  years ago once the teddy takeover became a bit too much. Now they take pride of place in the front garden each day, much to the delight of passers-by.What started off on day one as a small Teddy#s Bear Picnic has grown to much larger displays including a sports day, cricket match, Lego building, classroom scene, cycling trip, gardening and even a religious service on Easter Sunday. We began on day one with just four bears sitting out in the garden with tables and chairs and that was going to be it. But we got so many comments about it that we thought we#d better do something the next day, so it has grown from that, Morris said. The bears have a wee chat at night about what they want to do the next day and then let us know their plan in the morning so we try to accommodate them.We have had a constant stream of people coming past for a look every day. Until a few days ago we only knew a couple of our neighbours on both sides of the street, but now we#re meeting people we#ve never seen before. It has become a great talking point and people seem to look forward to it every day. The bears usually stay out until around  o#clock at night and then they all have to be put to bed. Thankfully the weather has been tremendous every day so far but we do have umbrellas, tents and gazebos in case of a rainy day.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wayne Rodgers, a member of Magherafelt-based wedding band The Allstars, has been entertaining residents since lockdown brough an abrupt end to his normal work. “Everything has just fallen off a clf, it’s all stopped overnight,” he told the County Derry Post. “Mark Stewart, who runs a bar in Magherafelt, said some of the homes were askinghe could suggest anything entertainment-wise. “The Manor Nursing home [in Magherafelt] was the first one I did. They had me back so I couldn’t have been too bad!” googletag.cmd.push A driving instructor by day, Wayne says he wanted to bring the residents of the care homes a bit of joy at a time when they are not allowed to have visitors. He said: “I’m not an essential worker but I’m not doing anyone any harm. I’m there on my own and it’s entertainment for them and gives them something to look forward to.” “They throw a sterilised plug out the window to me and I plug that into my own equipment. There’s no contact made. “It breaks up my day. It’s as good for me as it is for them. You can hear them clapping and singing behind the windows. googletag.cmd.push  “It’s sad - some of the relatives would come and sit in cars. They can’t go in to see their parents. They can only wave through the window and it’s very tough on everybody, strained times. “Some of the homes are doing wee videos from inside and posting them online so the families can see them all enjoying themselves, singing and clapping along.” Wayne is now a man in demand as word spreads of his singing exploits, and has performances lined up both in his adopted County Derry and native town of Ballynahinch. He said: “We did one and then another got in touch. My brother in law arranged four in Ballynahinch on Monday, so I’ve done about ten now at this stage. “I don’t like forcing people or anything, but this week I’ve been asked back to a few I’ve done before because the residents are enjoying it so much. “I have another three lined up this week with a possibility of a few more coming on board.” The old classics are proving popular as Wayne does the rounds, with one song in particular being requested on every occasion. “They all seem to love Danny Boy,” he said. “It seems to bring back memories. A lot of the patients in the homes have dementia and it seems to be a song that takes them home. They like the classics, the ballads – all songs from their era.” Although the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, there was one voice of dissent who would have preferred not to have Wayne singing outside his window. “I got one negative comment. I was in Ballynahinch the other day and a man said ‘what’s your name son ’ So I answered and he said ‘well will you feck off, I can’t hear the TV!’ “He didn’t enjoy it as much as the others, but it gave everybody a laugh.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Insufficient data was available to track the footfall in Mid Ulster’s parks, but the results did show that visits to grocery and pharmacies experienced a % drop.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chhindwara in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalia. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chhindwara. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in a local village. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chhindwara. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in a local village. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the death of the -year-old journalist in Creggan last April. Detectives from the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of Lyra have issued an appeal ahead of the anniversary. The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police. Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: “On Saturday,  months will have passed since journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead during rioting at Fanad Drive in Creggan. googletag.cmd.push Sadly Lyra’s mum died very recently without seeing justice for her daughter. While this appeal for information is being distributed by the police, it is also a direct appeal from the McKee family for help in getting justice for Lyra. “The community as a whole was devastated by Lyra’s murder. Condemnation of her killing was unequivocal. That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly. Log ontohttps:mipp.police.ukfrom your mobile, tablet, laptop or other device. We do not need to keep your mobile phone or device – we are only interested in downloading the videos or images of that night. Please tell us what you know.

On Lyra’s first anniversary I want to re-state the commitment of the police service to work with you as we collectively seek to release communities from the influence of terrorists. “For the purposes of this investigation, I will offer anonymity to those who wish to talk to us. All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that.

Emergency food parcels and hot meals are also being distributed by local groups. googletag.cmd.push Donna Matthewson, Apex Director of Housing, said they were delighted with how the initiative was operating. “Over the last number of years we have developed an excellent relationship with Fareshare, delivering fresh food to eleven local charities on an on-going basis,” she said. “Recently we have seen the impact Covid- has had on families in this city and this new service with Fareshare has been established as a result. “We are delighted to be able to assist in redirecting these vital food supplies to those who need them most. “Feedback from community groups has been fantastic and we hope to continue this service for the duration of the pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push Ciara Ferguson from Greater Shantallow Area Partnership praised the food delivery scheme. “This service has allowed us to provide much needed food parcels for those who have negatively impacted by the Covid- crisis. “The food is of great quality and iety and the extra help means the world to our local families whose incomes have been reduced as a result of the pandemic.” If you or someone you know is struggling to afford or access food during the Covid- pandemic, contact your local DEA partnership office:Outer North-   Outer West-   Triax-   Waterside-     If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The next job was to find a team name.Thoughts turned to Brazil and Rivelino.His club was Corinthians of Sao Paulo. The name stuck and soon there would be Corinthians of the Downpatrick Youth League.ldquoWe had a couple of good seasons, nothing special, but around  Austin got a squad of very good footballers together, David recalls.Each Saturday morning Austin took his big Ford Corsair out to Saul and Raholp to collect some boys, including Pat lsquoSkipperrsquo McMullan, Sean McMullan, Lorny Murphy and Noel Denvir.These joined a group of players from Crossgar, such as Mel and Con McCarthy, Leo Casement, Dan McHugh, Gregory Bell, lsquoChippyrsquo Bell and lsquoBootsiersquo Madine.Though Austin had an excess of players and it was hard to give everyone a game, the Crossgar boys encouraged him to sign a number of Killyleagh lads and so Jute Sullivan, Kevin Nelson and Chris Hagan joined up. They were a very talented forward line and team.Corinthiansrsquo main rivals were Panathinaikos, managed by Pat McKinney.At the end of the season Austin won the leaguersquos Manager of the Year award, for which he was very proud.He went on to be involved with Downpatrick Rec and was club chairman when they won the Steel and Sons Cup.Many of the Corinthians players went on to play for local teams in the Amateur League and Newcastle League, and also played Gaelic football.Corinthians may no longer exist, but they are still fondly remembered by those who can recall the early days of the Downpatrick Youth League and were fired up by the wizards of Brazil..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Centre.jpg","title":"Centre set up as new community support hub  ","story":"A NEW community co-ordination hub to deliver essential supplies to vulnerable residents across the district has been set up at the Down Leisure Centre.The Market Street facility has been transformed into a new distribution centre to help meet the needs of people who have been confined to home as part of the governmentrsquos lockdown measures.And with restrictions on movement set to remain in place for the next few weeks, the new community hub will have an increasingly important role to play.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub.The Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff have been redeployed to work across all sites and alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff are working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Council chairman Charlie Casey is encouraging those in vulnerable groups needing help to contact the freephone helpline.ldquoFrom the outset of our coronavirus response, we wanted to make sure we could reach those in the district who might need our help the most, he explained.ldquoThis is a very dficult time for all of us and we want to make sure that our most vulnerable residents have access to essential supplies.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

Last year he opened the Acoustic stage at the Glastonbury Festival.He also opened for Snow Patrol in the US, Europe and Asia and stood in as an honorary member of the band when guitarist Johnny McDaid was recovering after surgery.The son of Nuala and John McMullan, who still in Portaferry, Ryan started off performing at a young age, singing in a local band, Purple Road, when he was in his mid-teens.He is now staying at his Belfast home, having made it back from the US last month, just two days before the country closed off its airports.Many of his concerts have had to be postponed, including two nights at the Portico Theatre in Portaferry, now rescheduled to June -, and hisUK and Ireland tour this month.

Amusing himself by throwing me into situations where Irsquom either out of my depth, hoping for reconciliation, or unable to escape the truth that even at theend, Irsquom still holding on to even the worst of my attempts at love.ldquoIn A Heartbeat was written to sum up a stage I think we all kind of go through sooner or later: the understanding that something that once was, is now no more.But even at the end knowing it still has a hold on you, so much so, that no matter how toxic it is, or how little sense it made, yoursquod still run back to it in a desperate attempt to salvage it.The new single is already going down well with fans as the video has been viewed over , times online.Ryan added: ldquoEverything has been going great for me so far, even without my debut album coming out and that. I donrsquot think that all these tracks will be on my new album when I feel that itrsquos ready to be released.

This has enabled us to expand the nursing and midwery workforce by reaching out to those who have retired or lapsed their registration over the past number of years and provided opportunities for early registration for overseas staff.ldquoI am exceptionally grateful for the excellent response demonstrated by those who have volunteered toto practice and support the professional response to this pandemic.ldquoEach and every new registrant on the emergency register is a very welcome addition to the professional team and the support you will provide will have a signicant impact on outcomes for patients and the multidisciplinary workforce.Mrs McArdle said she wanted to specically thank nursing and midwery students for their ldquovaluable contribution to the delivery of safe, person-centred care as members of the nursing and midwery team.ldquoI recognise that this is an uncertain time causing great anxiety for many of you and your families.

I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach.

O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
