At school, he was a quiet yet popular guy who was friends with lots of girls.\u0027 The art gallery director was voted best dressed in high school  But long before he began dating the Hollywood star, Maroney was a \u0027sensitive jock\u0027 who shunned the limelight - but was popular with the girls at Middlebury Union High School in Vermont          The 34-year-old art gallery director, who began dating the Oscar-winning actress last June, was revealed to have popped the question after the pair were spotted celebrating in New York City earlier this month\u0027He is someone you can be yourself with. He\u0027ll spend a lot of time with you but won\u0027t talk s**t about you behind your back to other people.\u0027He was never a big fan of being the center of attention. He\u0027ll definitely do well with a big time actress and support her from the background.\u0027And for a big-deal New York City art dealer and gallery director, Maroney actually has an unusual background.He grew up on a 700-acre farm in Leicester, Vermont, a one-store town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie holding a VW Beetle high above its head.While he was born in Manhattan, Cooke\u0027s art dealer dad James and mom Suki wanted to taste some of America\u0027s off-the-grid living and moved north in 1986.They bought a giant windy hilltop property dubbed Oliver Hill Farm. The city slickers, said a neighbor, had no experience raising and maintaining animals but made a go at organic dairy farming with more than 250 heads of cattle.When they received the keys to their new kingdom, the neighbor added, they went through a three-year process to obtain organic farming certification, only the third in Vermont at the time.\u0027When they got here, everybody was rolling their eyes,\u0027 said neighbor Rodney Jerome, 72, who rents his 73-acre farm from the Maroneys.           According to the yearbooks leading to his graduation in June 2002, he wasn\u0027t a member of the Honors Society or a part of school plays, band, the Scholar Bowl or any non-sports activities          Cooke Maroney, far left, is seen in his 2001 High School yearbook from his junior year at Middlebury Union High School in Middlebury, Vermont. He was serving as a \u0027Junior Escort\u0027\u0027People thought \u0027who are these guys who are doing new things?\u0027 In no time, however, they won us guys over. They\u0027ve been very good to me. They\u0027re a great family.\u0027But the size of the undertaking eventually  caught up with the family.On one frigid night in February 1994, when Cooke was nine years old and his sister Annabelle just three, tragedy struck the budding farming operation. A fire,  likely started up by sparks in a utility closet, took out the farm\u0027s main barn.\u0027It lit up the area like it was daylight,\u0027 Jerome recalls. \u0027The barn was probably 200ft long and all in wood. There were more than 100 cows in there. It was some kind of a spark that started the fire, and before you know it, the whole thing was engulfed.\u0027Neighbors who saw the fire before the Maroneys, who were sleeping, rushed to the scene and managed to get most of the cows out, except for a few calves.Still, the milking business was finished. The Maroneys sold the surviving heifers and switched to renting their land out to area farmers either for grazing or making feed and hays.Over the past five years, they also started a $150-a-night down-home country bed-and-breakfast at their white wooden home while James maintained his art dealing gig.          He grew up on a 700-acre farm (pictured) in Leicester, Vermont, a one-store town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie that\u0027s holding a VW Beetle high above its head          Long before he began dating the Hollywood star, Maroney was a \u0027sensitive jock\u0027 who shunned the limelight - but was popular with the girls at Middlebury Union High School in Vermont          The  town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie holding a VW Beetle high above its head\u0027The good thing is after they got here, everybody started doing organic,\u0027 Jerome said. \u0027But in this area, neighbors are far from one another so we stay out of everybody\u0027s business. I think the daughter comes home more often than Cooke. I haven\u0027t seen him in three or four years.\u0027When asked if he knew of Cooke\u0027s celebrity fiancee, Jerome replied:  \u0027Sorta. Is that who Cooke\u0027s with?\u0027 In Middlebury, where Cooke was bussed daily to attend school and play Tigers hockey, he didn\u0027t appear to be overly active.According to the yearbooks leading to his graduation in June 2002, he wasn\u0027t a member of the Honors Society or a part of school plays, the band, the Scholar Bowl or any non-sports activities.\u0027He did play hockey and maybe even lacrosse,\u0027 said business owner Burkholder. \u0027He was sorta a sensitive jock.\u0027And he did okay academically, even in French.          Burkholder added: \u0027He was never a big fan of being the center of attention. He\u0027ll definitely do well with a big time actress and support her from the background\u0027\u0027That\u0027s because he scrambled to copy my French notebook at the last minute before class,\u0027 said Burkholder. \u0027I let him, though.

I can actually hear that on the street.\u0027People in this day and age, very difficult times, they just want to sit and go and have a good laugh.\u0027We don\u0027t have to think too much, just laugh. It\u0027s tapped into that, it\u0027s a very good time to do it, and I think we need it.\u0027I there\u0027s a lot of worried people out there, a lot of uncertain people, not knowing what the hell is going to happen next. I\u0027m one of them.

I think people want this sort of show because it means so much to them personally.\u0027           Rodney and Del Boy dressed as Batman and Robin in the  classic 1996 Only Fools and Horses episode when the brothers dress up for a party which turns out to be a wakeThe TV show ran for 33 years for 1981 across seven series, including 64 episodes and 16 seasonal specials.All of them starred David Jason as Del Boy and Nicholas Lyndhurst as Rodney. Lennard Pearce, who played Grandad, was replaced following his death in 1984 by Buster Merryfield as Uncle Albert.The comedy also still holds the record for biggest TV sitcom audience, when the Christmas 1996 special Time On Our Hands attracted 24.3million viewers. Nicholas Lyndhurst, who played Rodney in the beloved series, launched a musical of his own yesterday. The British actor is set to star alongside Frasier actor Kelsey Grammar in Man of La Mancha at the Coliseum Theatre in London in April.The English National Opera’s production of the musical is inspired by Miguel de Cervante’s Don Quixote featuring the iconic song Dream the Impossible Dream.Only Fools And Horses The Musical is on at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London  Lovely bubbly jubbly! JAN MOIR raises a glass of Tittinger to Del Boy and Rodney as Only Fools and Horses storms the West EndBy JAN MOIR FOR THE DAILY MAILChateauneuf du Pape! What is occurring here? On a busy Saturday night up West, a three-wheeled vehicle is illegally parked outside a London theatre. Fans swarm around the yellow Reliant Regal, posing for selfies and even kissing the bonnet.For despite its pantomime grime and battered bodywork, this little motor is as iconic as the Tardis, as famous as the Batmobile, more loved than Cinderella\u0027s pumpkin coach.     There are loud cheers when Del Boy appears in his sheepskin coat, setting up his stall with genuine models of the Leaning Eiffel Tower of Pisa. The year is 1989, and Del informs us that he still hasn\u0027t got a pot, how can I put this politely, to use as a receptacle for his body fluidsAnd we all know what its presence here means. It means Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad have finally made it to the West End.Only Fools And Horses The Musical opened in review at the Theatre Royal Haymarket at the weekend and already tickets for the show are rarer than genuine Rolexes on Del\u0027s fly pitch in Peckham market.In the two-hour show, comedy actor Paul Whitehouse plays Grandad, while Tom Bennett is Del Boy and Ryan Hutton takes the part of Rodney. All three sing and dance in a romp which includes 20 songs, amid scenes and running gags directly culled from writer John Sullivan\u0027s much-loved sitcom.Oddly enough, in one old episode of the telly series, Rodney ponders the notion of a musical about the Trotters. \u0027Then as a sequel, they could do Schindler\u0027s List on ice,\u0027 he concludes, surmising the improbability of such an idea.        John Sullivan\u0027s original scripts shimmered with genius, while his finely drawn characters could never be bettered and his bevelled plots stand the test of time. I mean, pot pourri! The good news is that the gang are all here, including Boycie and Marlene (Jeff Nicholson and Samantha Seagar), Raquel (Dianne Pilkington), Cassandra (Pippa Duffy), Trigger (Peter Baker), Denzil (Adrian Irvine), Mickey Pearce (Chris Keily) and special mention to Oscar Conlon-Morrey who is quite brilliant in his range of supporting roles.In a show that mixes up musical styles with hilarious gusto, the Driscoll brothers (Pete Gallagher and Adam Venus) pop up to sing a menacing ditty a la Gilbert \u0026amp Sullivan while Raquel emotes sadly of love in a way that Andrew Lloyd Webber would approve.For the leads, accuracy of impression seems to be more important than depth of musical skill, with only Bennett rising effortlessly to the challenge of both. He even makes Del tap dance! What a star.Still, Hutton absolutely nails down Nicholas Lyndhurst\u0027s Rodney, while Paul Whitehouse manages, from the depths of Grandad\u0027s stained armchair and a shirt that still has more food on it than a menu, to make the old boy both pathetic and heroic. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t mind a nice bit of haddock for my tea,\u0027 he says at one point, and it nearly made me cry.The bad news, if there is any, is that the show has little dramatic impetus. Instead, it is a compendium of classic Only Fools episodes and plotlines. The dialogue, like Del Boy\u0027s pre-blessed communion wine, has been imported wholesale from old shows. There is little new except a few songs, and some of those are a bit make-weight.There are moments when the jubbly is not as lovely as it could be and you can sense the audience yearning for something more. No doubt this will improve as the show gets into its stride.The plot, what there is of one, is similar to Dates, the episode in which Del meets Raquel. Along the way, Rodney marries Cassandra (from an episode called Little Problems) and later the gang all plan a day-trip to Margate (Jolly Boys Outing).Still, perhaps this was for the best. John Sullivan\u0027s original scripts shimmered with genius, while his finely drawn characters could never be bettered and his bevelled plots stand the test of time. I mean, pot pourri!Who could possibly top Del Boy\u0027s magnificent malapropisms and jambon-fisted grasp of languages? Sullivan died in 2011, but his son Jim has teamed up with Whitehouse to produce a script and score that honours his father\u0027s legacy, complete with musical contributions by Chas and Dave.The TV show won many awards during its 33-year run. Starting in 1981, there were seven series, 64 episodes and 16 seasonal specials, all starring David Jason as Del Boy and Nicholas Lyndhurst as Rodney. Lennard Pearce, who played Grandad, was replaced after his death in 1984 by Buster Merryfield as Uncle Albert.It holds the record for biggest TV sitcom audience, when Time On Our Hands attracted 24.3 million viewers at Christmas in 1996.Who is going to mess with that legacy? For if you laughed at the idea of Del Boy performing the \u0027Himmler\u0027 manoeuvre on Grandad after he ate an Odour Eater first time around, well you will howl again when it is replayed in the musical. We all howled.

The letter explained that disciplinary allegations made against her had been considered by a \u0027panel\u0027, and that the panel had recommended that she be dismissed.An employment tribunal in Watford in 2017 ruled that Ms De Groen had been discriminated against on the basis of her sex and religion.At the time it was considered a landmark judgement and the nursery appealed.          Ms De Groen (pictured above) was dismissed after it had been revealed at a barbecue that she was living with her boyfriendThe Employment Appeal Tribunal has now concluded that Ms De Groen was not discriminated because of her religion, but because of her sex.The judge overseeing the case, Mr Justice Swift, cited the case over the bakery in Belfast, that had refused to ice a cake with a slogan supporting gay marriage.The Supreme Court ruled last year that the bakery had not discriminated against an inidual\u0027s personal characteristics.Mr Justice Swift said that while an employer was not allowed to act to the detriment of a worker based on their religious belief, it was however permitted to act based on its own beliefs.However, the consideration of damages for harassment and sexual discrimination has been sent back to the tribunal in Watford.The tribunal heard that bosses at the nursery expressed the view that co-habitation outside marriage was wrong and that having children outside marriage was wrong.Ms De Groen was 23-years-old at the time and the tribunal heard that bosses at the nursery said that \u0027time was passing for Ms De Groen to have children\u0027, and that if Ms De Groen had problems with the idea of marriage she should seek counselling. Speaking to The Times, the chairman of the Accord Coalition, which campaigns for inclusivity in education, Rev Stephen Terry, said that the ruling would leave teachers in faith schools vulnerable to religious discrimination.\u0027The government should remove exemptions from equality law that some faith schools believe grant them a broad ability to religiously discriminate in the recruitment and employment of teachers\u0027, he said. "},{"url":null,"title":"Chilean Burmese python needs little help shed skin vet","story":"    The three and a half metre long Burmese python is held by the Chilean vet as it slithers through his handsThe shedding process can take up to two weeks and the snake will stop eating and find somewhere it can rub against a rough surface to help remove the old skin.But this snake found itself in a tricky situation on a stand where a rough surface was not available.While humans shed skin constantly snake skin comes away as one piece in a process called Ecdysis when even the eye caps will be removed.When a snake cannot easily shed its skin or the skin does not come away as one piece it can cause health conditions and even death."},{"url":null,"title":"Men woman pierce faces Indonesian street festival","story":"    A Tatung seen piercing metal needles through his cheeks during the Cap Go Meh festival celebration          A Tatung seen piercing metal through his cheeks during the Cap Go Meh festival celebration.

He said: \u0027One of them is a small-scale, heavy-duty nuclear energy unit that can be installed in a missile like our latest X-101 air-launched missile or the American Tomahawk missile—a similar type but with a range dozens of times longer, dozens—basically an unlimited range.    Target: The land-based nuclear cruise missiles brought to the UK sparked public protests when they were deployed to the USAF base at Greenham Common west of London in 1983          Women\u0027s protests: Women formed a peace camp at Greenham Common from the time it was identified as the host for the cruise and Pershing missiles and remained there long afterwards. In December 1982 one of their protests was a human chain around its perimeter          Blocking tactic: Anti nuclear protesters from the Greenham Common Women\u0027s Peace Camp tried to stop cruise missiles arriving by stopping access to its main gatesBeginning in 1983, two deployments  in particular were to become infamous flashpoints.In the UK, the U.S. Air Force base at Greenham Common, Berkshire, to the west of London, would be used for 160 medium-range nuclear cruise missiles, and a smaller number of Pershing II rockets. RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire would receive 64 cruise missiles.In Germany, three bases - Neu-Ulm, Mutlangen and Neckarsulm - would receive a total of 108 Pershing IIs.But in both countries the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament launched huge and widespread protests.           Focus: The Perishing II missile was deployed in 1983 to German bases in the face of huge public anger, with demonstrations of hundreds of thousands who saw it as a threat to West Germany\u0027s existence  Cold war welcome: In West Germany there were protests regularly against the missiles and their deployment. They entered active duty in 1983 and by 1987 a deal for their destruction was doneIn Germany, Mutlangen became the focal point, while in Greenham Common, a peace camp of women against nuclear weapons sprang up at the perimeter. Attempts to move munitions were met with sit-down protests on roads outside.In Bonn, then the capital of West Germany, as many as 400,000 people took part in one anti-Pershing protest, part of a day of demonstrations across Europe, while other protests saw a human chain from U.S. headquarters in Stuttgart to the gates of Mutlangen.1983 also saw one of the most dangerous moments of the Cold War when NATO\u0027s Able Archer war games, which involved activating troops and giving dummy instructions to fire nuclear weapons, were misunderstood by the Soviets.          Soviet threat: An SS-20 preserved in Russia shows the weapon which the Pershing II and cruise missiles were designed to counter. The SS-20 rocket launched multiple warheads and could reach all of Western Europe from Soviet-controlled territory including East GermanyThey thought the exercise was really preparations for a first strike with the new Pershing arsenal part of the plan. The Soviets ordered its nuclear arsenal to be prepared for action and placed bombers on high alert.  If NATO forces under U.S. command had moved to an increased state of readiness, the Soviets could well have launched their own nuclear weapons. Spy Oleg Gordiesky later wrote an account of the tense moments, which ended when Able Archer concluded on November 11 1983.What peace protesters had not realized was that behind the scenes, the U.S. had made an offer in the late 1970s to the Soviets, that if it agreed to get rid of its SS-20s, the U.S, would withdraw the Pershings and the cruise missiles.By 1986, the Soviet Union was lead by Mikhail Gorbachev, and a deal began to take shape.By September 1987, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev in Washington D.C. It eliminated all the weapons being protested against in the space of four years, leaving just a handful of mementos in museums.Now however, its future appears doomed.                         "},{"url":null,"title":"Five bedroom waterside home 100ft mooring Thames goes market 1 8m","story":"    The property in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, is on the market for £1.795m and \u0027perfect for Wind In The Willows fans\u0027          It has far reaching views over the River Thames, which is at the bottom of the garden, and is less than a mile from Marlow High Street.

Pushed to the sidelines of mainstream art history, artists like Zilia Sánchez were overlooked from the New York art scene in the 1960s, while Latinx artists have only recently gained attention from blockbuster museums.But Latin American art is finally taking over museums across the US, celebrating culture from south of the border. From fiberglass replicas of Aztec sculptures to photos of Mexico in the 1960s, a growing number of museums around the country are showing their support for contemporary artists from Latin America – especially with solo shows of Latin women artists. Here are some exhibitions featuring some of Latin America’s finest talents to catch this season, from group to solo shows from Los Angeles to New York.Until 26 May, WordsMatter at the Blanton Museum of Art, at the University of Texas in Austin, showcases over 150 Latin American artworks from the 1930s on. They all incorporate language in some form or another. There’s concrete poetry by Brazilian writer Augusto de Campos and Spanish writer Julio Plaza alongside political prints created by Chilean, Latinx, and Chicanx artists. There will also be an artist book by Argentinian writer Leandro Katz from 1971, which explores the meanings behind the Ñ character. The museum has been collecting Latin American art since 1963 and just added 119 Spanish and Portuguese artworks to its collection.Beverly Adams, the Latin American art curator, said: “This exhibition gave us the opportunity to examine a strength of the Blanton collection – Latin American and Latinx visual artists exploring language in their work.“They do so by inventing new alphabets, engaging with prose and poetry, pioneering conceptual practices and producing art that is socially empowering. This exhibition highlights how artists use language to communicate personal, poetic and political messages, many of which speak to past and present cultural circumstances.”On 28 February, the annual film series returns to the New York museum with new works by or about Latin Americans. With a special focus on South American directors, the program showcases narrative shorts that explore gender fluidity, youth culture and sexuality.The program includes Verde, a short directed by Colombian film-maker Victoria Rivera, a coming-of-age story about a young girl’s life, and Lui, a short film directed by Denise Kelm about a gender-fluid circus teacher.“It’s important to make visible the great films, that for multiple reasons, do not get screened at cultural institutions nor film events,” said the program’s curator, Jesus Hernandez. “Representation does matter and if people and institutions in the position of power are not willing to find a balance and space for all of these erse voices, then it’s harder for everyone to see the complete picture.”Until 14 April, Mexican artist Mariana Castillo Deball is showing sculptures and installations that fuse Mesoamerican iconography with a contemporary twist. Finding Oneself Outside features a survey of works that dig deep and dig out ancient artefacts, from stone sculptures to symbols found in 16th century notebooks, to use them as inspiration for sculptures. Each piece is a question of collective, personal and political history for the viewer to decode.The most stunning piece in the show is a pastel green fiberglass cast of the Coatlicue statue, one of the most famous Aztec sculptures from the 15th century – created by an unidentified Mexican artist – which is knocked on its side to show its hollow interior.Until 12 May, catch the pioneering Mexican photographer’s showcase of photos through the eyes of one local in Graciela Iturbide’s Mexico. From indigenous groups in Mexico, like the Juchitán to the Seri and the Mixteca, 120 photographs walk us through intimate snapshots of Frida Kahlo’s personal belongings found in her Casa Azul bathroom 50 years after her death (some of these items are also on view at Kahlo’s retrospective on at the Brooklyn Museum). The photos, taken from the 1950s onward, also showcase Mexico as a country in transition – from political upheaval to religious control. There’s also a close-up of Mexico’s cultural heritage, featuring photos of everything from rare cacti to goat slaughtering rituals in Oaxaca.Until 12 May, Craft Contemporary (formerly the Craft \u0026amp Folk Art Museum) in Los Angeles is showcasing El Salvador-born, Los Angeles-based artist Beatriz Cortez’s latest works in Trinidad  Joy Station. The sculptures here offer a look at what life could be like with communal living. There are steel geodesic structures (a la Buckminster Fuller) made from car parts alongside food gardens and beds in cages, referencing the refugee children held at the border.“As an institution in LA, it’s important to reflect the larger community. We would be neglecting the community if we didn’t acknowledge and recognize the work of Latin and Latinx artists,” said Craft Contemporary exhibitions curator Holly Jerger. “Given the history of the art establishment in the US, showing anyone outside the traditional white western male canon is a political act, one could argue, to a certain degree.“At the same time, we want to be a relevant institution to the community we live in by showing artists outside of that traditional establishment canon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/041cfc92503fcbc478177862e083d62e8d9e489d/188_13_3684_2211/master/3684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1efd764bb0f6e82e7939e637db61c3b8","title":"sainsburys asda supermarket merger cma competition","story":"Supermarkets will continue to press case after ‘fundamentally flawed’ CMA analysisThe merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda has been thrown into serious doubt after Britain’s competition watchdog raised a catalogue of concerns, including higher prices and reduced quality and choice for customers.In a provisional verdict on the planned £10bn merger, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had found “extensive competition concerns” as part of its investigation into the proposed deal.In a strongly worded statement, the CMA said the merger would create a “substantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level”.The merger of Britain’s second and third-largest supermarkets would create a market-leading chain with some 2,800 supermarkets and convenience stores. The watchdog outlined numerous concerns, saying the deal would harm competition in every local market for supermarket groceries where either are present, in every local market for online grocery shopping. It also said it could mean higher petrol prices in 132 local markets where both supermarkets operate petrol stations.The CMA, which since last June has been led by the former Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, laid out limited options for addressing the concerns but said it was “likely to be difficult for the companies to address the concerns it has identified”.Options include blocking the deal altogether or “requiring the merging companies to sell off a significant number of stores and other assets – potentially including one of the Sainsbury’s or Asda brands – to recreate the competitive rivalry lost through the merger”.Analysts were sceptical that the merger could be re-engineered sufficiently to allow it to be cleared. The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: “The deal looks to have suffered a mortal blow the CMA struggles to see how remedies can deliver its view of a competitive UK market.”Sainsbury’s and Asda said they would press ahead despite the CMA’s concerns. Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, described the CMA’s analysis as “fundamentally flawed” and accused the regulator of rewriting the rules.“A UK plc with Brexit looming, and a completely unpredictable set of competition rules, who would invest in this country? This is just outrageous,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s and Asda said: “These findings fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market … We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f66daf0c4035830adb86be8c981ada3a1da7269/0_0_2555_1532/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ebe3f8c5a497cdc2273f726e37488f4","title":"sajid javid shamima begum conservative leadership","story":"The home secretary’s political ambitions are shamefully exposed by this playing to the galleryPolitics has always, to some extent, been the art of combining doing what’s right with doing what’s in one’s own political interests. It would be naive to pretend otherwise. But in recent months – with a weak prime minister desperately trying to cling on to power, and senior Tories hungrily eyeing the top job – it feels like naked political ambition is shaping real-world outcomes more than ever before.Nowhere is that more evident than in Sajid Javid’s decision to revoke Shamima Begum’s British citizenship. In trying to position himself as Theresa May’s successor, the home secretary is signalling to the tabloid press just how tough he is on national security and immigration. Perhaps, as a son of immigrants, he feels he has more to prove.But make no mistake, signalling is all it is. Javid is setting this up as a fight between a strong home secretary and a mushy liberal left he can portray as willing to forgive supporters of Islamic State of any crimes.The extent to which Begum is responsible for crimes she may have committed is a thorny one. On the one hand, she is a vulnerable young woman who was groomed here in Britain as a child, married off to a man almost twice her age 10 days after arriving in Raqaa, and has lost two children in brutal conditions. On the other, as an adult she has expressed abhorrent views in the handful of media interviews she has given and has failed to unreservedly condemn a terrorist organisation that she has supported in full knowledge of the unspeakable atrocities and genocide it has committed.I’m not sure we as observers have the knowledge or evidence to judge the extent to which she is a victim or a perpetrator. That’s for the courts. But it doesn’t matter. Even if Begum was the worst terrorist ever to have been born in Britain, Javid’s decision is wrong: both on national security grounds, and because it shuns Britain’s international obligations.We don’t know the extent to which Begum is a security risk, or whether a few months in a deradicalisation programme would see her reject the ideology and crimes of Isis. That’s for our security services to determine. But she may be a risk to Britain and the rest of the world. We can’t leave her to roam free in Syria and potentially become even more of a poster child for anti-west ideology. Look at how well that turned out when Osama bin Laden was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in the mid 1990s: he went underground and became harder, not easier, to monitor. If she is brought back to Britain and deemed a security risk, she can at least be monitored around the clock. Don’t forget that terrorist attacks across Europe – including the Manchester Arena bombing – were committed by European nationals who travelled to Syria, then returned off their own back.At the age of 15, Shamima Begum flees her home in Bethnal Green, east London. She travels with schoolfriends Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana. The three intend to meet another friend, Sharmeena Begum – no relation of Shamima – who had travelled to Syria in late 2014.CCTV footage shows the girls walking through Gatwick airport, where they boarded a flight to Turkey. There they are picked up by smugglers and taken across the border to an Isis base in northern Syria. Once there they move into a women’s house in Raqqa and apply to marry.The families of the girls say that two of them have married Isis fighters, without disclosing which. They say they are distraught at the news.It later emerges that Begum had married 27-year-old Yago Riedijk, an Isis fighter from the Netherlands, 10 days after arriving in Raqqa. Soon afterwards she became pregnant with her first child, a daughter named Sarayah.Abase marries an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir. He was later reported by intelligence agencies to have been killed by a coalition airstrike.Sultana’s family say that they believe she had been killed in an airstrike in Raqqa in May 2016.\u0026nbspBegum and her family flee Raqqa as Isis retreats and head south-east to the town of Mayadin. She has another child, a son called Jerah. Later, the family moves again as Isis is pushed back.Begum sees her two surviving classmates, Sharmeena Begum and Abase, for the last time.Jerah dies, aged eight months, of malnutrition and an unknown illness. Her daughter dies soon after, aged one year and nine months.Begum, who is heavily pregnant, gives an interview to the Times, in which she says that she should be allowed to return to the UK to raise her unborn third child. She gives birth a few days later. The Home Office tells her family that her citizenship will be revoked.For Javid to strip Begum of her British citizenship because she may be entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship, on a technicality, through her parents, may or may not be legal. That will be determined in the courts. But what it says to the rest of the world is this: yes, Begum may have been born and radicalised in Britain, but we are washing our hands. She’s your problem now.Why should Bangladesh, a country she may well have not even visited, be responsible for her? Or even worse, how is it right to lay responsibility for her safekeeping with the Syrian Defence Forces, who have more than enough on their plates? They have already implored European countries to take back the thousands of European nationals who travelled to Syria in support of Isis and ended up in their custody.One of the things that sets Britain apart from a terrorist organisation like Isis is that we are a liberal democracy and subscribe to the rule of law. We understand that we have not just legal, but moral, international obligations. What signal does it send, not just to Isis sympathisers but to other unsavoury regimes around the world, that Britain is prepared to dump its values when it suits a cabinet minister who has the premiership in sight? What does it say about us that we are prepared see an innocent baby who is a British citizen by descent suffer for the crimes his mother may have committed?Whether or not Javid’s decision to revoke Begum’s citizenship is overturned – and he may well be expecting that – he wins politically. If his decision gets reversed he can blame it all on unelected judges, abrogating responsibility for the difficult decision he as home secretary should have taken.It’s a depressing state of affairs. A Conservative party – that holds itself up as the party of law and order – weakening national security because it suits the political ambitions of one of its most senior MPs. Sajid Javid 1, liberal democracy 0.

That is one reason why Wednesday’s decision by three remain-supporting Tory MPs to abandon their party in despair was so significant, if not surprising.EU issues have tested Conservative unity for a generation, but it is still a dramatic step from dissent to schism. The choice by Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston to sit as independent MPs is symptomatic of more than disagreement with Theresa May over policy. It expresses more than distress at the way Brexit has been handled. It is the ideological and cultural trajectory of the Conservative party – its capture by an extreme faction – that has led the schismatic MPs to feel they can no longer in good conscience fly its colours. This would be remarkable under any circumstances. Coming in the same week that eight Labour MPs made an equivalent decision to abandon their party, it is extraordinary.With 11 MPs, the newly formed “independent group” marshals as many votes in the Commons as the Liberal Democrats and one more than the DUP. It is not clear how those numbers will be deployed (the group is more easily identified by what it is against than what it is for) but one obvious consequence of Tory defections is that the government’s majority shrinks.Mrs May might well conclude that she is now even more dependent on the votes of hardline Eurosceptics and Ulster unionists to secure a Brexit deal. It would be sadly in keeping with past behaviour if she were to respond to political adversity by digging deeper into an already narrow trench, mortgaging the country’s future still further to people who have never shown her durable loyalty. That would be a tactical mistake and a misreading of the moment.It was not the simple prospect of Britain’s departure from the EU that propelled the defectors from the Conservative party. They all voted in favour of triggering the article 50 withdrawal process in 2017. There is no reason to disbelieve them when they say the bonds of allegiance were broken by the prime minister’s pursuit of a needlessly hard model of Brexit and her refusal to hear moderate voices, even from her own side of the Commons. They also condemn the government for failing to address the grievances that drove support for Brexit in the first place or heal isions exposed by the 2016 referendum campaign.That criticism is all the more damaging to Mrs May since she once declared the pursuit of social justice to be her greatest priority in Downing Street. Instead she has persuaded once loyal MPs that the Tory party itself is incapable of leading a national healing process. The prime minister should be determined to prove them wrong, not for the sake of her pride but because the country would be better served if she switched to a more consensual approach. The hardline Eurosceptics whom Mrs May indulges cannot claim to speak on behalf of everyone who voted for Brexit, let alone the whole country.Yet the prime minister accepted their narrow interpretation of the referendum result and thereby accelerated their ideological capture of her party. It is too late to woo the defectors back, but it is not too late to recognise the truth in their bleak account of what the Tories are becoming under her leadership – a dogmatic, intolerant, anti-European sect that has lost all sight of how to govern in the national interest. If Mrs May does not want that to be her legacy she is running out of time to do something about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aa891d384674405e77254a7e24135576eebce54/0_0_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c114e88455a0eb06dd92316419ce9eea","title":"republicans alexandria ocasio cortez green new deal","story":"Republicans have claimed Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional resolutions will mean the end of ice cream, hamburgers and the US military. Where are they getting it from?Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the American political right’s objet socialiste du jour, recently introduced a Green New Deal – a joint Congressional resolution with Democratic senator Ed Markey calling for a “10-year national mobilization” overhauling nearly every aspect of American society to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Those who have read through it will find a hopeful and ambitious but dry legislative document.However, Ocasio-Cortez says that all Democratic presidential candidates support the Green New Deal, which has sent conservatives into a nonsensical tailspin, claiming it would mean the end of ice cream, hamburgers and the US military. Much of the opposition isn’t based on the text of the deal at all, but a draft FAQ that was released by Ocasio-Cortez’s office before they quickly retracted it, saying it “doesn’t represent the GND resolution”.In actuality, the proposed resolution doesn’t mention any regulations or bans whatsoever. It mostly provides broad ideological goals for legislation to aim towards, such as “guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage” for all workers.Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortez’s, director of communications, has since said that the goal is to reach net zero emissions, rather than no emissions at all, “because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc7a64c71b245d2f4ee133077296da7c5fdbb5e8/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4597291c35e4617d1e3a7e040441c03","title":"everyones invited inclusivity reigns at london fashion week","story":"Bethany Williams wins Queen Elizabeth II award and praise for her social conscienceFollowing the news of Karl Lagerfeld’s death on Tuesday, London fashion week came to a close on a sombre and reflective note. But hope and positivity stemmed from the young talents who are set to continue his pioneering spirit.Everything to do with Williams’s collections – from the materials she uses (recycled, repurposed and reused fabrics), to the people who make them (such as the San Patrignano drug rehabilitation community in Italy), to the models who walk in her show (this season she worked with TITH models to cast homeless models and pay them the market rates) – is inclusive, democratic and sustainable. Far from the business of fast fashion, Williams is a purveyor of slow appreciation, wanting, to “create an alternative way of working that’s beneficial to people and the planet”, as she puts it.Williams was awarded because of her commitment to “giving back”. The chief executive of the British Fashion Council, Caroline Rush, told the audience, a “sizeable percentage” of profit from Williams’s wholesale and distribution was returned to her partners to help them further their work and contribute to the foundation of “a sustainable and equal society”.This collection was entitled Adelaide House in honour of the women’s shelter that provides support for former offenders in Liverpool. Twenty percent of the profits from the collection will be donated to the facility. The northern English city was an inspiration for the collection: one of the most striking looks was a suit woven from thin shreds of the local newspaper the Liverpool Echo, which collaborated with Williams to reuse and recycle its waste product. The suit’s buttons were made by the Manx Workshop for the Disabled on the Isle of Man.The soundtrack to the show was devised by the British DJ Benji B, who remixed the voices of inmates at Downview prison in Surrey repeating one-liners including “change is a part of life”, “free ourselves” and “leaving old habits for new ones”. Williams told the  backstage at the venue that she wanted “for people who couldn’t be here, for their voices to be heard”.Rush told the audience: “This moment is about recognising a young creative and creating more opportunities for them to grow their business in a sustainable way.” It poignantly evoked one of Lagerfeld’s most famous quotes: “Youthfulness is about how you live, not when you were born” – a sentiment that 29-year-old Williams embodies in her quest to readdress what it means to design, make and wear clothes for a modern age.Earlier in the day, last year’s inaugural recipient of the award, Richard Quinn, presented his third collection, Fearless Glamour. In the year since he won the first award, Quinn has enjoyed incredible success, increasing his stockists from 15 to 45 in the first month and having Amal Clooney wear one of his gowns on the red carpet of the Met Ball in May 2018.This collection was set against a back drop of wild flowers and a period chandelier and, in line with the inclusive note sounded by many of his contemporaries, Quinn told guests ahead of the show that his intent was to create a “secret garden that everyone’s invited to”.Quinn made his name from heady floral prints designed and produced in his print studio in south London, and this collection was an evolution of that aesthetic. While his garden ran the gamut from oversized blown-up flower power and paisley to blurred (borderline ikat) and wildflower prints, this time round there was also a heavy focus on delicate crystal and jewel appliqué. These are – as he acknowledged – techniques more often associated with couture.“We really wanted to elevate what we were doing from last season and do our prints as embroideries to show a difference,” he said backstage, always referring to his work as the product of his design collective rather than his own as sole designer.

The two clubs had met at Anfield in official Uefa competition only twice before, in 1972 and 1981, and on both occasions the game finished with both keepers as content as you’ll ever find them. A 0-0 scoreline was staring us in the face, in plain sight, giving us the big do-you-want-some, despite all that talk of two rickety defences facing two potent attacks. The Fiver has Bayern in the box seat now, though Andy Robertson was quick to play the no-away-goal-conceded card, which is a fashionable argument these days, while Mats Hummels insisted that “the result is satisfying but no more, it is still 50-50.” Nevertheless, the Bayern defender was happy to have carried out a plan to perfection. “We wanted to keep the fans quiet.

That is slightly shy of someone like Cameroonian dictator Paul Biya, who has notched up 43 years of tireless service to his subjects. But as far as comparisons with other bosses in the humanitarian sector are concerned, there’s really no one to remotely touch him in terms of longevity. Certainly not since Mother Teresa left us.As the highest-paid union official in the world, Taylor has seen off various attempted power grabs. You may recall his professional demise was widely predicted last November, when upstart PFA chairman Ben Purkiss called for an independent review into how the PFA is run. Under sustained pressure from people who wondered if the organisation ought to be dragged into the late 20th century, never mind the 21st, Taylor eventually announced that he would permit a review.In tandem with this – and I am sure it gave Taylor absolutely no pleasure – the PFA confirmed it had found two QCs who advised that Purkiss was not even eligible to be a member of the PFA. (It was duly pointed out that if Taylor really wanted to get into debates about compliance with PFA regulations, the organisation’s own rulebook states that “the chief executive should hold office for five years unless she resigns or is removed”. Furthermore, elections must be held every five years, but various PFA sources told the Times they weren’t aware of such a thing happening for at least 10 years.)We haven’t heard any more about that “ineligible” line of attack on the turbulent Purkiss, thank goodness. But the other thing we haven’t heard anything more about, would you believe, is the promised review – and it now emerges that a full three months after Taylor’s announcement, it had yet to even be commissioned. Sport Resolutions, the independent body earmarked to carry out the review, last week confirmed to the  that it had heard nothing formally from the PFA. The PFA itself has declined to comment – something of a trend of late.No doubt Taylor has been beavering away tirelessly for his members behind the scenes. But it has been a quiet few months for the PFA boss in front-of-house terms. A quick trawl through the archives reveals that Submarine Taylor has surfaced only a few times since all that unpleasantness. In late November, it was claimed that he had referred to black footballers as “coloured” at a PFA event to promote racial equality and ersity. Four sources who attended the event suggested this, and a complaint was made to the PFA, which later stated that Taylor “firmly believes he didn’t say it”. And that, it seems, was the end of that.Then, last month, came the annual reveal of Taylor’s pay packet. In 2018, we learned, Taylor still paid himself £2.29m in salaries and bonuses, just as he did in the previous financial year. If you want to put that into some kind of perspective, the PFA spent a mere £125,000 on research into head injuries in the year up to June 2018. Looked at another way, the average salary in the highest earning tier of charity bosses was found to be £186,000 in 2017.Indeed, the other area of potential vulnerability for the PFA is a regulatory compliance case into their charity by the Charity Commission. Back in November, the latter told the  it was “aware of concerns regarding the expenditure of the Professional Footballers Association Charity”, and was working to establish the facts. It stipulated: “Trustees should be able to demonstrate that all decisions around expenditure have been carefully considered in line with the best interests of their charity and those it is set up to help.” The investigation was reported to be focused on how the PFA general fund charged the PFA charity.So that remains ongoing. As for the pace that even commissioning the review of the PFA goes, might it be picked up somewhat? The further we get from all the heat and light generated in November, the more the momentum ebbs away. The professional obituaries of Taylor that were filed at the time could well end up looking premature.“I am the first to admit that there are always areas we can improve,” he declared as he promised the review. Is he? I mean, he’s not the last to admit there are always areas they can improve. But with this sense of urgency, he probably places around the 25,000th mark.Despite Taylor’s formidable powerbase, this should be a pressing concern to anyone who cares about issues affecting those players who make the game, from mental health to financial abuse to the mounting evidence of the effects of head injuries. The pressure on the PFA to submit to a modernising review should be maintained in the interests of its members. If this glacial pace continues, it is difficult to escape that same old impression: that the interests of this most idiosyncratic of union chiefs are being better served than those of his members."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dc19ccc8a5f54748c1cb285bc597645d30f22e/0_72_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7887cb72cb345814095756f932fc8de","title":"ferry stories why travellers are taking to the seas","story":"Amid airport security queues, environmental concerns and the enduring slow travel trend, ferry travel is enjoying a comeback. Johanna Payton, founder of no-fly travel site Feet on the Ground, explains whySerenity is elusive in today’s fast-paced world. A moment of complete calm and contemplation seems to be a rare and wonderful find. For me, those precious moments occur on a boat. Out on the waves, the horizon undisturbed, with a seemingly infinite stretch of sea before me. As legendary sailor Vito Dumas once said: “It’s out there at sea that you are really yourself.” On deck, enjoying awe-inspiring views, the cares of everyday life blown away on the sea breeze, you can appreciate his point.For me, there is no better way to travel than by sea. Flying is my nemesis. From airport chaos to the confined space of an aircraft, nothing about commercial aviation appeals to my sense of adventure – or comfort. I’ve spent too many hours stuffed in sardine cans at 30,000ft, hurtling high over oceans instead of enjoying them. It doesn’t help that I’m a fearful flyer many long-haul holidays have been tainted by the white-knuckle flights either side.Favouring boat travel isn’t just about managing aviophobia, though. Whether I’m on a short ferry crossing or a cruise, the sea provides a true sense of travel, from the impressive physical shift of a ship leaving port to its sturdy navigation of the open water. As a travel writer who hates flying, boat crossings make my leisure time and my work a pleasure. Every journey stirs my instinct and emotion. “We are tied to the ocean,” John F Kennedy said. As my ship steers towards an exciting new destination, I feel that affinity.And I’m not alone. “The journey is part of the holiday,” says travel writer and author Helen Ochyra. “I’ll stand out on deck, whatever the weather, and watch the ropes being untied, the boat slipping away from the dock and the landscape drifting farther and farther away.“Ferry travel doesn’t feel like a journey that has to be made, it feels like one you want to make. On a recent trip my husband and I left the mainland just before sunset and, standing on deck, we watched the sky turn orange and a pod of porpoises playing in the loch. I’ve spotted whales breaching, watched gannets risk their necks ing for fish and seen some of the best sunsets I can remember – all on ferries.”Tom Bourlet, founder of the Spaghetti Traveller blog, agrees: “On a plane, it’s difficult to make out much more than grassland on the ferry, there is something exhilarating about seeing land slowly getting closer.”He kicked off his ferry habit en route to the Isle of Man: “I booked the ferry because airports always feel stressful. From sitting in an overpriced airport to waiting on cramped planes, travel seemed like a nuisance. I love embracing new cultures and seeing amazing sights, but can’t stand plane journeys. Since I began taking ferries, this experience has drastically changed. On my first visit to the Isle of Man, I managed to catch the sunset and, beer in hand, felt pretty chuffed with my choice of ferry over plane.”For Cathy Winston, travel editor and writer of award-winning family travel blog MummyTravels, it’s about the sense of adventure. “Even on a fairly simple journey from A to B,” she says, “the wide, open sea makes it feel like you could be off to discover new lands. There’s a certain romance you don’t get on a plane or sat on a motorway.”Winston also values the family-friendly aspects of sea travel. “There’s something so relaxing about being on the water, especially with kids,” she says. “You can drive a car straight on to a ferry, so there’s no hanging around in airports, or trying to cram everything you need into one bag. On longer journeys, you can sit down and have a proper meal, or bring your own, which takes away another stress. Wandering around onboard during the journey is good for easily bored small people, heading out on deck to look for land and boats – and sharks, pirates, or anything else that takes their fancy.”Whether it’s for kid-happy convenience or sheer romance, boats will always be the preferred mode of transport for many travellers. Nina Simone once said: “My first love is the sea and water, not music.”Yes, a boat gets me where I want to go, avoiding the hassle – and terror – of air travel, but out on the waves, as reality melts away, I always rediscover my own primeval passion for the sea.From being able to bring your car, bike or four-legged friend with you to the lack of luggage fees, there are plenty of reasons to favour ferry travel for your next trip. Drive (or stroll) on to one of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferries, enjoy sea views, onboard facilities such as lounges, restaurants and shops, and you could drive straight off at Manx capital Douglas in under three hours. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin – there are some great offers available this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2feb92ab9ff735ad9360fbf87b1676a0dfb9d71/0_96_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeea6392b48bae23cd7f3ce9370d616f","title":"the great seascape castles kippers and coastal walks on the isle of man","story":"From history and hiking to hairpin bends, Mark Hillsdon and his partner take a tour of the Isle of Man’s cultural attractions, with time to spare for some classic Manx cuisineSetting off from Liverpool, we leave the calm morning waters of the Mersey estuary behind and head out across the Irish Sea. Having taken in the views from the deck of the iconic Isle of Man Steam Packet Company ferry, it’s time to settle down to breakfast and in less than three hours we’re moored up in Douglas – the Isle of Man’s capital – with a crescent-shaped bay backed by an impressive sweep of guesthouses, hotels and apartments.The trip across the island to the harbour city of Peel involves navigating the twisting roads that make up the famous TT racing circuit. Parts of this journey feel like you’re driving through a giant Scalextric set: roadside grandstands rise on either side of you, while dormant television gantries occupy strategic spots for cameras along the road.Peel is the centre of the Manx fishing industry, and it’s an ideal spot for an afternoon exploring the atmospheric labyrinth of narrow streets, picture-perfect fishermen’s cottages and treasure-trove antique shops. A visit to the House of Manannan, a museum named after the Celtic sea god, helps bring the island’s maritime heritage to life. As the afternoon fades, we head to the city’s impressive castle, which sits proudly on the cliff edge of St Patrick’s Isle, to take in the stunning sight that gives Peel its local nickname: Sunset City.Then it’s off to Baie Mooar, a guesthouse in Ramsey, on the north-east of the island, run by Jen and her husband Simon (a classically trained chef, whose traditional Manx kippers are smoky perfection). Spacious, airy and beautifully presented, it’s a cut above the traditional B\u0026ampB, and the view across the bay from our huge double room is breathtaking.Our busy day two begins in Laxey, home to perhaps the island’s most famous landmark, the Lady Isabella. Now the largest working waterwheel in the world, this feat of Victorian engineering, still resplendent in its red, white and black livery, was built to pump water from the surrounding lead, copper and zinc mines. It’s worth taking on the vertiginous spiral staircase for the views out across the Laxey valley.After a quick cuppa at JJ Ribbons, a quaint haberdashery that doubles as a cafe, we opt for a trip up Snaefell (snow mountain), the highest peak on the island. The mountain railway opened in 1895 and still relies on many of the original wooden carriages, with their slatted seats and varnished interiors. Despite their age, the trains are at home on the steep, winding track, which takes you to the summit where – on a clear day – you can see England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. There are a number of possible walking routes back down, but we choose to take the swift ride back and spend the rest of the day exploring the island’s quiet lanes and historical sites.The next stop is to see the elaborate carved Norse crosses at Ballaugh and Andreas, before heading south to Tynwald Hill, the ancient meeting place of the oldest parliament in the world. At the Braaid site you can walk in the footsteps of ancient ancestors, and explore the remains of an iron-age roundhouse and Norse longhouse.Our day ends at the Abbey restaurant, set in the shadow of the 12th-century Rushen Abbey amid fantastic gardens dotted with ancient trees. It prides itself on a seasonal, ever-changing menu, making the most of the island’s fantastic supply of seafood.On Sunday we rise early to walk part of the Raad ny Foillan, the 95-mile “Way of the Gull” coastal path around the island, hugging a coastline that rivals the seascapes of Cornwall. Niarbyl Bay is deemed one of the most stunning spots on the island, with its thatched cottage, rock pools and lobster pots piled high, while a short walk along the coastal path leads to an unspoiled sandy cove.We have a brew at the Niarbyl Bay Cafe, where the car park doubles as one of the island’s many dark sky sites, spots so devoid of light pollution that on a clear night the heavens are dazzling. Then it’s off on a whistle-stop tour of Castletown, the island’s former capital, where the imposing Castle Rushen – a medieval citadel that was once besieged by Robert the Bruce – looks down over the harbour, all looming parapets and crenellated ramparts.Having dragged ourselves away in time to catch the return ferry, we crowd on to the aft deck to try and see a minke whale that was spotted off the coast earlier that day, the port of Douglas slowly vanishing in our wake.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin.

I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash.

But can something made from nuts and coconut oil ever rival cheddar or camembert?Dairy is torture for animals, disastrous for the environment and only questionably vital for good health – but the arguments increasingly piling up in favour of veganism are, for many, still amply dismissed by one straight from the heart: “I could never give up cheese.” The cheese on toast of childhood, bronzed at the edges and bubbling with Worcestershire sauce the midweek pick-me-up of macaroni cheese the cheeseboard lending a genteel veneer to late-night gossiping: for those who can stomach it, cheese is among the most potent and dependable of life’s little pleasures.Though I have lived happily as a vegetarian for years, just the thought of even a Babybel (which I eat daily) silences the voice in my head nagging me to at least think about going vegan, starting next week, maybe. An ethical, sustainable alternative to cheese could be the vegan lobby’s coup de grâce.Charlotte and Rachel Stevens tell me it’s already here – here being Brixton Village in south London. The sisters opened La Fauxmagerie, the UK’s first and only “plant-based cheesemonger”, two weeks ago – and both weeks, they have completely sold out.“There have been queues out of the door – we can’t keep up,” says Charlotte, 30, at the shop on Tuesday afternoon. When I arrive, she and Rachel are furiously replenishing their shelves with their latest, larger delivery, and have just wrapped up a job interview for a part-timer to help them go from five days’ opening to seven. Even though they are closed, we are interrupted by 10 potential customers in just over an hour.The response has by far exceeded their expectations, which was to earn enough to cover a full-time salary for Rachel, 26 – who left her job as a merchandising assistant last week – and the sizable rent. But interest has also been boosted by the action of the trade association Dairy UK, which wrote to the sisters“to kindly ask them to remove any undue reference to ‘cheese’” from their website and signage.Vegan cheese is often made using similar techniques to dairy cheese, including fermentation, but features a wide variety of ingredients to achieve different textures and flavours. Cooking cheeses often have soy and brown rice protein bases creamy styles such as Camembert are often approximated with cashew nuts. Almonds are also used as a base. Favourite vegan ingredients such as coconut oil and truffles are common.In the letter, Dairy UK said calling non-dairy products “cheese” – instead of, say, “chease” like some vegan suppliers – contravened EU rules protecting dairy terms, and was misleading to consumers: “Plant-based products are simply not dairy in any sense – from a taste or nutrition perspective.” But that may have been counterproductive, with media coverage pitting La Fauxmagerie as David to Big Dairy’s Goliath. Charlotte says a family flew in from Dublin last week to visit the shop purely on the strength of the press.While vegan restaurants, takeaway fare and even supermarket items have exploded in the past year, apparently embraced even by meat-eaters going “flexitarian”, the trend does not seem to have extend to plant-based cheese. As one vegan message board discussion titled: “Anyone else hate vegan cheese?”, even vegans hate vegan cheese.“It is hard to make something else taste like something as distinctive as cheese, rather than coconut or cashew nut or nutritional yeast,” says food writer Felicity Cloake, diplomatically. She was a judge at last year’s world cheese awards, won by a Norwegian farmer with only 12 cows – but cows, nevertheless. I asked John Farrand of the Guild of Fine Foods if vegan cheese would ever be included, and he said it would be unlikely. Organisers are struggling to keep up with the boom in artisan cheeses as it is.However, he admits that although vegan cheese strikes him as “slightly oxymoronic”, it is of undeniable interest to consumers. “I’m not going to say it’s a bad thing because it isn’t. It just might not be for me.”I am surprised to learn that the Stevenses are far from thoroughgoing vegans themselves – though Charlotte has a severe dairy intolerance, she eats meat, and Rachel only went full-time vegan this January. Perhaps as a result, they are well aware of vegan cheese’s reputation, saying it has been earned by lower-quality products that are overly reliant on coconut oil. It can smell “really like feet”, says Charlotte. “You do feel like you’re missing out, and getting a worse version.”The products the Stevenses stock are mostly nut-based and made by small suppliers, and the sisters are confident they will win me over. As they said in our earlier email conversation: “It’s fantastic watching people’s faces change from dubious to wowed in a matter of seconds.”As I approach my sampler, it becomes clear that some suppliers are aiming to approximate varieties of real (as Dairy UK would have it) cheese. At one point one sister refers to a “goat” variety. The Kinda Co, meanwhile, offers a “faux lox and dill” cream cheese, with baked and marinated carrots standing in for salmon. I don’t like the taste of salmon myself, so the absence of fishy essence makes this perfectly palatable, and even tasty, smeared on an oatcake – but I’m perhaps not best placed to judge.Next is Kinda Co’s Farmhouse Spread, a cream cheese with a cashew-based, cheddar-inspired “authentic, cheesy taste”. Charlotte says she can’t get enough of it, and that the solid equivalent is the sisters’ go-to recommendation for customers who come in seeking a “converter cheese”. Listening back to my recording of our interview, the diplomacy with which I deliver my verdict (“It’s, uhhhhhhhhh, flavoursome”) is painfully audible.I am keen to try the solid “Farmhouse” – which is compared to a West Country cheddar, but it is sold out. At £5.99 for around 120g, this may be an endorsement.Seventy per cent of customers come into La Fauxmagerie looking for a cheddar, a blue, or a camembert, says Charlotte, with the latter especially difficult to offer in terms of both taste and value for money. “I would rather have someone not buy camembert than get home after having spent £10 and say: ‘Vegan cheese sucks.’”She and Rachel are trying Mouse’s Favourite Aged Blue, a cashew-based “camblue”, with me for the first time. It certainly looks persuasive on the oatcake, densely packed and promisingly flecked – but though Rachel finds the texture “amazing”, it’s not quite blue enough for her liking. For Charlotte, it is just right.Perhaps it’s the camera trained up my nostrils, perhaps it’s that cheese is not strictly logical – but as I bite down I struggle to explain what I think of the camblue. It is clearly lovingly made, with careful attention paid to its dairy inspiration it puts up the same feeble resistance as my incisors cleave through. It is, in many regards – look, texture, mouthfeel – impressively similar. But something is lacking, even if I struggle to articulate precisely what.My mistake, I realise, is in directly comparing Mouse’s Favourite camblue with those that I can enjoy whenever I fancy upgrading from BabyBel. While understandable, that is misguided, and maybe unfair.Back at La Fauxmagerie, I am cheered by a perfectly adequate cube of non-dairy feta, infused in olive oil, and find a taste of mozzarella for cooking authentically flavourless. It suggests that the secret to vegan cheese is prioritising texture over flavour.But it’s a sliver from an ashy grey wheel, hulking beneath a glass cloche, that finally wins me over. A bold, smoky cashew number “ripened in a coat of activated coconut charcoal ash”, it sounds nonsensical – but even a smear off the side of a knife has a compelling, powerful umami taste. The company claims “a depth of woody, hickory flavours”, and it’s true.Charlotte says it has been likened to a Stilton – but the Hackney-based producer I’m Nut OK doesn’t bother with comparisons, and instead forgs its own, plant-based path. Even its name, Minerthreat, is oblique. (It is also, it would be remiss of me not to mention, £7.49 for 120g.)If you approach it not as cheese, but as cheese-adjacent, it is much easier to accept and even celebrate it on its own merits.Charlotte is not surprised that I’m a fan of I’m Nut OK – the idiosyncratic range (including one thick with paprika and another truffle variety in an eye-catching black, with golden veins) is La Fauxmagerie’s other top recommendation.“If you miss cheese, that salty, fatty, umami, savoury flavour, that is tasty in and of itself. It’s not a direct replica of any cheese – so I’d say everyone is going to love the taste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_77_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e56926aabb0350cafaa217a56b8c89","title":"guardian supporters future journalism","story":"By opting for a reader-funded business model, we rely on readers to support our groundbreaking independent journalism.

In addition, the Windrush revelations gave a voice to the Commonwealth citizens who were in the UK for decades but subjected to terrible indignities because they had no paperwork.We have also continued to build on the ’s proud tradition of progressive journalism by increasing our focus on the environment, committing to reporting on inequality, exposing offshore tax avoidance through both the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, and investigating the behaviour and employment practices of corporations in a globalised world.By supporting us you can become part of a global community of  readers with a shared set of values and a vision for a more hopeful world.

They share a passion for the same issues as us – from the climate crisis to inequality to the influence of big technology companies on our lives.For example, they were very generous in supporting Carole Cadwalladr’s reporting on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which cracked open a global debate on data, privacy and power which has had such a big impact around the world.You have called this at a critical moment, one demanding that journalism connects with readers as citizens, and inspires them to engage with the world. A key element of this connection involves the ’s funding model. When many sites across the world have introduced paywalls. Why did the  go in a different direction?We’ve decided not to put up a paywall, meaning that we don’t restrict any of our journalism by asking readers to pay to access it. This is because we want  journalism to be as widely accessible as possible - even in communities where they can’t afford to pay for it. There are so few news organisations that are both based in facts and progressive in how they see the world there are so few news organisations that you can trust and there are hardly any news organisations that have an ownership structure like the ’s — we have no shareholders or proprietor and we are guaranteed to be free from political and commercial influence. Many readers have told us they contribute financially specifically because they want the  to stay open and accessible to all, so that progressive journalism that is so clearly independent can have the widest possible impact.Inequality is an issue you have set out as a priority for the  to cover in-depth under your editorship. You have spoken about the excesses of neoliberalism fostering the huge isions and resentment that we’re seeing in the world. Can you tell us about the coverage you have prioritised in this area?Extreme inequality is one of the biggest drivers behind the political shocks we’ve seen in the last few years, and trying to understand it, contextualise it, find out what it’s like to live it, and how it can be changed for the better, is part of what the  needs to be doing right now. From Bolsonaro to Salvini to Trump from the chaos of the Brexit negotiations to the widespread collapse of civic life, with vital services being starved of funding or outsourced or privatised - we must be reporting on both the events themselves and their impact on people’s lives.Our aim is to report truthfully on how government policy and economic shifts affect people, which is a thread that runs through  reporting and remains central to ongoing projects such as Anywhere But Westminster, the impact of climate change globally, and our series on the New Populism.As well as examining and challenging the different power structures that produce and entrench inequality, I think one of the most important things we can do is inspire empathy in our audience when they read these articles, watch the ’s video journalism or listen to our podcasts. We want to help build understanding of how other people live and how that impacts broader society and politics.Wealth disparity and income inequality have varied impacts in different parts of the world. As a former editor of both  Australia and  US, and now as editor-in-chief of  News \u0026amp Media globally, how have you seen inequality manifest differently in different regions?Poverty is a big issue in the US, where it is particularly linked to race, and we’ve done some important reporting including tracking the UN’s work as they document the extreme levels of deprivation. In terms of immigration, our reporters analysed thousands of documents to provide a comprehensive picture of what happened to those prosecuted under the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy.After the Parkland school shooting in Florida, we invited students from the school’s magazine to come to our New York office and to report from the student march against gun violence in Washington DC. They directed our coverage for 48 hours in a powerful takeover of the site.It’s important for our reporting in the US that we don’t just focus on what Trump says on Twitter, for example, but also on what his administration is actually doing — for example, how dramatic tax cuts or new immigration policies entrench poverty.In Australia, poverty also has a link to race, and Indigenous Australians lead vastly more difficult lives than white Australians. We have a fantastic Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, who has helped shine a light on these issues and give a really informed perspective. We also have an excellent regular series called Life on the breadline, in which Australians write about their often shocking experiences of living in poverty.In Britain, the big story of inequality since 2010 has been the impact of austerity on local communities, and we’ve taken care to report that deeply and seriously, whether it’s the closure of libraries or the privatisation of parks. And in Britain too there’s a link to race when it comes to inequality: think of Amelia Gentleman’s 2018 revelations of the Windrush scandal, or our recent Bias in Britain series, which revealed the everyday discrimination faced by minority ethnic people. We are committed to reporting every twist and turn of the Brexit process, and what it means for all parts of Britain, and we also want to continue to recognise that Brexit is about much more than Westminster politics. By really listening to people, we can identify and tell the important stories about the issues that led to the vote. We also want to ensure our European readers, and our readers around the world, know that regardless of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, the  will be always be committed to Europe.One million readers have given the  their financial support in some form over the past three years. Why is this model so critical to the work the  is doing?It’s very important to the  that our journalism has as much impact by reaching as many people as possible. It means more people have access to factual information, helpful analysis and interesting ideas about what’s happening in the world, so they’re better informed and empowered to make decisions in their own lives. We now have 180 million browsers all around the world each month, and readers who live in every country. Our readers help us by bringing us stories and ideas, and they help us understand where we may need to change our approach to a story.A central tenet of the purpose you have set out for the  in your essay, A mission for journalism in a time of crisis, is hope. Why do you believe hope is so important in the current climate?I was inspired by Rebecca Solnit’s book Hope in the Dark, in which Solnit argues that hope is not blind optimism it is instead an engagement with the world, a way of facing what is happening, contextualising it, understanding it, and believing you have the power to change things for the better. Solnit shows that authentic hope requires both clarity and imagination, which are perfect concepts for a news organisation like the  in a time like this — clarity, so you get the facts you need to understand the world, plus imagination, to provide new ideas to help make a better one.That seems to me an important thing that the  can do for its audience in this time of crisis. Together, with our readers and supporters, that adds up to something meaningful, that I think is a kind of hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5416cd1e35ad127484a90f03c421a62996e6c4/0_36_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5fbac36f18213166bcdf0c12f79130","title":"what european education project can tell us about brexit podcast","story":"When the writer Peter Pomerantsev was a teenager, he was sent to a school that was part of the European Schools network, which counts Boris Johnson among its alumni.

I suspect this will prove to be a bad miscalculation by Umunna et al. The ‘future of British politics’ will be one without them - which is a shame because I’d much prefer we united all of our efforts into getting rid of the vile government. Mike BarkerThe only thing that would be useful - to the country, if not the leadership of the two main parties - about Umunna et al going would be that they take a few Tories with them, and thus remove May’s majority. Theoretically at least, this could really change the direction of British politics and force a second referendum, or the abandonment of no-deal or of Brexit altogether. But if they can’t do that, this is just a waste of time and column inches. And I can’t help wondering exactly what it is that Chris Leslie sees in the company he’s keeping ... unless it can tempt away half a dozen Tories to go with them. wightpaintFinally! A centrist party that remain voters can get behind! So sick of Tory and Labour spearheading Brexit meaning no effective opposition. Let’s get real proportional representation and sort this country out in coalitions representing this ided country’s views - the only way we’re going forward together as a country is in compromise and the two-party system prevents this. Tallisker2Pretty damning. These seven will get a lot of stick rightfully so I believe, but still pretty damning for Corbyn and most sickening of all, the Tories will get a pass on the Brexit mess because of disunity like this. Not sure how these seven don’t see that, or maybe they don’t care? There probably is space for a new centrist party, but we’re facing the biggest issue in generations which needs addressing. Now wasn’t the time for this, and for timing alone these seven should be case into the wilderness of British Politics for ever. Rob BrackstoneThe “New” Labour people have no real perspective on how history will view their actions. The timing of the 172 MPs who voted to out Corbyn just after the referendum and probably cost Labour the 2017 GE and now, it looks like they are jumping ship just when we need as much effort as possible behind a people’s vote. TynebobI don’t even support Labour but this is a sorry state of affairs. Breaking away from the party offers no strategic gain. It doesn’t make remain any more likely, if anything it diminishes it. Reform only happens from within - wasn’t that the central argument of remainers in the first place? AmouxThe comparisons with the gang of four of 1981 are wrong. Yes both are a splintering caused by a hard left turn in the Labour Party. Yes, the Labour party is currently unelectable like in 1981. The more so because its handling of Brexit will lose it millions of younger votes including e.g. the seat of Canterbury.Most obviously though 2019 is different because there was in 1981 no defining political cause of the day on which to gain political energy. Brexit affords that to this new group and allows them to rehome potentially millions of voters (which the Lib Dems have singularly failed to do under an ailing leadership). Campaigning for a second vote will drive energy and electoral power to this new group, which is the calculation they have made on timing - now and not in six weeks.The second point is the age of these MPs. This is a newish generation of MPs (but with credibility from some experience). The gang of four were all past their political peak - and career trajectory matters in politics. Political change against the populists like May and Corbyn is coming from the new generation, ground up - May and Corbyn are either side of 70 and don’t recognise the need for inter-generational change. Neither are radical practical thinkers and are both in different ways intolerant of change. Any reform agenda they have is going nowhere right now - since they have both have been hobbled by their extremist wings.In this Brexit mess the political change happening now under our feet is as radical as the social change of the 1960’s, and the centrist MP’s see that. They do have a good chance. sussexplanThe Labour Party hasn’t changed since the last General Election when these MPs stood under the Labour banner. It is they who have deserted the Labour voters. They should resign as MPs and fight by-elections as Independents, but they won’t because basically they are gutless. DADAspeakThe left of the party withstood all kinds of pressure to leave throughout the 90s and beyond. Most of us stayed if we weren’t kicked out. These saps have no fortitude. I’ve been a member of the party for 22 years and have never voted any other way. There is exactly the same amount of antisemitism as there has always been in Labour, not very much. As for the hard left machine politics stuff, there was nothing more machine like than the Blair years. And if they think a broadly Wilsonian stance is hard left then maybe they are in the wrong party. Well, Good luck to them. At least they’ll have a job till the next election. But if they let a Tory in may the dead of their constituencies rise up and eat them. DrWhatsonThis is sad, very sad. Labour is supposed to be a broad church, MPs getting hounded out is not a sign of a government in waiting. And the rebels are right on antisemitism, the response from the leadership was too slow and inadequate. One gets the impression Corbyn preferred to soft-peddle when criticising old comrades. That said, this was always going to happen with Brexit. We will see a similar split with the Tories, it’s only a matter of time. Finite187Pity about the number of cynics on here. Surely this is just a symptom of how polarised politics has become and a result of loss of faith in weak leadership, that reasonable people are trying to find moderate ground.

If there is no agreement, and no visa exemption for the UK, the British government may adopt a similar approach – and that would be a disaster.”Ježek said the European parliament’s position had been adopted unanimously and that MEPs could not accept “colonial language which has no place in the world”.The parliament is suggesting the footnote could be reduced to merely stating that there is a “controversy between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty of Gibraltar”.But Ježek warned there did not appear to be any sign that the council was willing to compromise. “It is quite stubborn.”The legislation being discussed by the EU institutions would put the UK on a visa-exemption list from 29 March, when the country formally leaves the bloc.Until 2021, there would be no need for a visa even if the UK left the EU without a deal. After that, UK nationals would need to pay £7 for three years’ visa-free travel under a new European travel information and authorisation system, which is being introduced for all non-EU states.But if the impasse is not broken and the UK crashes out on 29 March, British tourists will be left in legal limbo as the UK will be neither on the list of countries where a visa is required or among those with an exemption.MEPs fear that British nationals seeking to stay in an EU country for fewer than 90 days could ultimately be required to pay €60 (£52) for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for the completion of bilateral deals before being allowed to travel.Should the Commons finally ratify the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement, UK nationals would continue to be treated as EU citizens during a 21-month transition period, providing more time for a solution on the visa exemption to be found.UK government sources said they were confident that the legislation would go through and that British nationals would not be required to pay for a Schengen visa.The row over the description of Gibraltar, over which Madrid has been in dispute with Britain for three centuries, erupted again last month when Spain made its demand for a footnote.Madrid initially wanted all the EU’s no-deal legislation – drafted in case the UK leaves without ratifying the withdrawal agreement – to note that Gibraltar was disputed and on a UN list of “non-self-governing territories … subject to decolonisation”.That move was blocked by France, as French Polynesia and New Caledonia are also on that list. The compromise note on the visa legislation proposed by ambassadors instead says: “Gibraltar is a colony of the British crown.”Claude Moraes, the Labour MEP acting as the rapporteur representing the European parliament in the negotiations with the council, said the use of the word “colony” was “completely unnecessary legally or politically for this legislation to be enacted”.“The addition is a political act. And my strategy is to work in a focused way to get a compromise wording to allow visa-free travel to become a reality, but I will never back down on the colony wording, which is unacceptable.“Having looked in depth to this legislation there is a clear understanding now of the wider economic and personal impact of this visa situation if this does not pass. It will affect the lives of potentially millions of people in their business and family arrangements.”The British ambassador in Brussels, Sir Tim Barrow, has already formally tabled his opposition to that description. Theresa May’s official spokesman criticised the Spanish approach when details emerged, describing Gibraltar as “a full part of the UK family” with “a mature and modern constitutional relationship with the UK”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db530f46dec9a5b86514c81188fe9f914af13e90/729_347_3424_2054/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b788807335e64154267feb7032f1f1e","title":"derek hatton suspended from labour over tweet","story":"Derek Hatton has been suspended from the Labour party over a tweet just two days after his readmission was confirmed.Hatton, who was deputy leader of Liverpool council in the 1980s and a leading figure in Labour’s Militant wing, was controversially readmitted after 34 years, it was revealed on Monday.But the Liverpool Echo reported that on Wednesday Hatton was notified of his suspension pending an investigation into a tweet he posted in 2012.It is understood that the party was not aware of the tweet when Hatton applied to rejoin but decided to take action after officials found out about it.While the tweet was not specified, on Tuesday the Jewish News reported that in 2012 Hatton tweeted: “Jewish people with any sense of humanity need to start speaking out publicly against the ruthless murdering being carried out by Israel!”He was originally expelled in 1986 after a disciplinary hearing over his role in Militant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca14bb30a7cb907f26cafa29ba918bbcd89f080/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=965cba1f16158ae2b71f588f3bca3176","title":"european medicines agency loses bid to end uk lease over brexit","story":"Leaving EU does not ‘frustrate’ contract with landlord Canary Wharf Group, high court rulesThe European Medicines Agency has lost a high court battle to cancel its £500m long-term office lease in London to move to Amsterdam because of Brexit.It had argued that the lease on its Canary Wharf HQ had been “frustrated” by Britain’s impending departure from the EU, a legal term meaning that owing to an unforeseen event, the basis on which the contract was signed had changed, making it impossible to fulfil.But landlord Canary Wharf Group took the agency to the court to enforce the contract, which lasts until 2039.Ruling on the side of the landlord, Mr Justice Smith concluded that the UK’s transition to a non-EU member state did not constitute a “frustrating event”.“The EMA remains obliged to perform its obligations under the lease,” he said.City lawyers said the ruling would stop a wave of copycat lease cancellations from banks and other companies forced to move some or all operations to an EU member state because of Brexit.Some of EMA’s 900 staff are still at Canary Wharf but the agency officially moved to Amsterdam in January.“The judge has ruled that Brexit does not amount to an event of frustration of the EMA’s lease and this result will be welcome news in the property and legal market, bringing greater certainty as to the impact of Brexit on contracts,” said Ben Hatton, a lawyer for Clifford Chance, which represented Canary Wharf Group.The EMA said it would take some time to study the implications of the decision. While it respected the high court ruling, it reiterated its initial claim that it had “no choice” but to leave London because of Brexit.Smith disagreed. He said in his judgment: “This is a case where the legal effects on the EMA of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union could have been, but were not, ameliorated by the European Union.“This failure to do so is relevant to the question of frustration and, in my judgment, renders the frustration of the lease self-induced.”In his 95-page ruling, the judge said the EMA had signed up to the lease under English law and could not escape its obligations just because it was an agency of the EU.“It would seem a remarkable development for a contract involving an agency of the European Union to receive different treatment compared to a contract not involving such an agency,” he said.The EMA said it believed a preliminary reference to the court of justice of the EU was still “the most appropriate way forward”.Owen Talfan Davies, a partner at European law firm Fieldfisher, said the ruling was “no surprise”.“Brexit may ultimately be the cause of some tenants being unable to comply with rental obligations under their leases, but it is not going to give rise to lawful grounds to avoid those obligations,” he said.The judge confirmed that the EMA could sublet or assign the premises at 30 Churchill Place subject to the landlord’s consent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d494fb05757dc9e06751835fb565d0c0df3baffd/0_98_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f850205bb72eaa3004aa578abb858c8","title":"tory mps defect independent group soubry allen wollaston","story":"Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen leave party, citing Brexit and lurch to rightThree Conservatives have quit their party to join the new Independent Group of MPs, declaring that hard Brexiters have taken over and that the modernising wing of the party has been “destroyed”.Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen explained their decision to join the new group, founded this week by seven Labour MPs, who also left their party.In a devastating critique of Theresa May’s handling of the Brexit negotiations, the three MPs said, at a press conference Wednesday afternoon, that the Tories had lurched to the right, adopting Ukip policies and pursuing a hard Brexit.Their move reduces May’s already tenuous working majority to eight, raising still more questions over her authority amid rumours that there could be further Tory defections to come.Allen, who represents South Cambridgeshire, said she felt “so excited, in a way I haven’t felt since I was first elected ... I, we are prepared to dare to dream that this could be possible”. She said she was driven out of the party not only by Brexit but by the Tory record on austerity. “I believed I was part of a party that worked collaboratively, welcomed knowledge and had the capacity to feel, but I have slowly realised that I have not.”Wollaston, who represents Totnes in Devon, said she had come to the conclusion she would no longer recommend that people voted Conservative. “Would I have joined the party in 2009 … if the party had looked then as it did today? And the answer is no,” she said. “And if I wouldn’t encourage others to vote Conservative in a general election, then how can I possibly continue with the Conservative whip?”Soubry, elected as MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, said the decision had come “with a great deal of thought and a considerable amount of heartache” and that other Conservative MPs were close to the edge.“You don’t join a political party to fight it … The truth is the battle is over and the other side have won,” she said. “Dear friends, now former colleagues, who share those one-nation values and principles will deny it. But I believe in their heads and in their hearts that they know it is over. Brexit now defends and shapes the Conservative party. I’m not leaving the Conservative party, it has left us. The modernising reforms that had taken years to achieve were destroyed.”The three resigned in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday, writing: “We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP. Brexit has redefined the Conservative party – undoing all the efforts to modernise it. There has been a dismal failure to stand up to the hardline ERG, which operates openly as a party within a party, with its own leader, whip and policy.”The Independent Group was formed on Monday by the erstwhile Labour MPs, who include Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger and Chris Leslie. Joan Ryan became the eighth MP to quit Labour and join the group on Tuesday night. The MPs said they felt it necessary to leave Labour because of the leadership’s Brexit policy and failure to tackle antisemitism in the party.In a statement, Theresa May said she was disappointed by the decision of the three to leave her party. “I am saddened by this decision. These are people who have given dedicated service to our party over many years, and I thank them for it,” she said. “Of course, the UK’s membership of the EU has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time. Ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy. But by delivering on our manifesto commitment and implementing the decision of the British people we are doing the right thing for our country. And in doing so, we can move forward together towards a brighter future.”The prime minister added that she was determined the Conservatives would still offer the “decent, moderate and patriotic politics that the people of this country deserve”.At the press conference all three of her departing MPs said they had lost faith in the politics of compassionate Conservatism, championed by David Cameron, which had drawn them to the party.Allen said she had been inspired by Cameron and the party’s “competence and compassion” but said she had found herself “so often going over the top, fighting for compassion in our welfare system” and that the party had “deepened rather than fixed” people’s suffering.Wollaston, chair of the health select committee, said she had originally hoped May would be able to change things. “The prime minister hasn’t delivered on the pledge she made on the steps of Downing Street to tackle the burning injustices,” she said.The group said they intended to sit as independents, like the eight MPs who have quit Labour. “There will be times when we will support the government, for example, on measures to strengthen our economy, security and improve our public services,” the three MPs said in their letter. “We will continue to work constructively, locally and nationally, on behalf of our constituents.”Before their press conference, Soubry, Wollaston and Allen entered the chamber of the Commons together and went to their new colleagues on the opposition benches. All 11 MPs sat together during an occasionally surreal prime minister’s questions, where both May and Corbyn studiously ignored the defections in their exchanges.Tory sources suggested the Conservative associations of the three MPs would be free to start selecting new Conservative candidates. A No 10 spokesman said, however, that it was not insisting the MPs fought byelections and that it was hoped one day that the trio would return.Phillip Lee, who quit as a justice minister to back a second referendum, had been tipped as another potential Tory departure, but he ruled out the move Wednesday morning. Sam Gyimah, who also resigned as a minister over the government’s position on Brexit, ruled out joining the Independent Group on Tuesday.Others who have previously been critical of the Tory approach to Brexit, including Nick Boles and Antoinette Sandbach, both ruled out quitting the party.A Labour source said the defections meant “the Independent Group has now become a Tory establishment coalition”. The source added: “What unites the 11 MPs is their business-as-usual support for austerity, corporate tax cuts and big-money corrupting politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7443da09695df37aba4563e35c20845874bb6448/0_36_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68930f6bc7673ef16623eb7671d8c54e","title":"we need byelections readers on the tory defectors brexit","story":"You have been reacting to three Tory MPs leaving the party and discussing what might be next for BrexitAh well, at least a few Tories have put their money where their mouths are.

However, as an ex-Toryex-rightwing Labour coalition we can more or less guarantee it will support continued austerity, a continuation of the work capability assessment, so continued trauma for disabled people, continuation of Universal Credit, continued severe underfunding and privatisation of the NHS, and no meaningful approach to the environmental crisis. Best avoided at election time then. jessthecripSo it’s official, some Labour MP’s would rather share a platform with the Tories. The same Tories that have inflicted a decade of misery on their voters. I think they have sealed their fate. HeggityAll these MPs were elected as MPs on party manifestos pledging to respect our referendum decision. If these MPs were honest about their aims, they would at once resign from the House of Commons and stand in byelections so that voters could decide whether they should continue to draw their salaries or not. But they will not do this. Instead of doing the honourable thing, they will continue to draw their salaries and stay in parliament on false pretences. They cannot credibly argue that Britain needs another referendum without accepting that their own constituencies have a far more urgent claim for a second vote on them. Will PodmoreAt least half this Independent group were probably going to be deselected. It seems the only glue they have is a burning desire to overturn Brexit. Should give them all a very time limited shelf life, maybe of just a few weeks. Rider000I’m a fan of the policy direction Corbyn has taken the Labour party. If the new Independent Group was able to somehow force another vote on Brexit, I’d probably vote for them though, based on that one policy alone. A weird way to feel. pH1974Labour remainers should now issue a public warning to Corbyn that if he doesn’t commit to a second (legal) referendum they will join the Independent Group. Tory remainers should do the same. Both are in a position of power now. Time to use it. Tony72I have sympathy with the three Tory defectors – they have consistently made their opposition to Brexit known, plus the Tories are in government, Labour aren’t.They are wholly correct that May has refused to stand up to the ERG and her deal with the DUP has been disastrous, they’ve taken our money and predictably wanted more. Between them, the DUP and the ERG are holding the government to ransom and are dictating the process. Addicks123Great news. Corbyn is held hostage by the extreme right of his party. May is held hostage by the extreme right of her party. The extreme right and extreme left of both parties are bent on taking this country to a highly damaging Brexit. To me, the Independent Group is a voice of sanity in a sea of madness. I think more will join them. They could be the salvation of this country. Their move is a gamechanger.They had to move now to give MPs a real choice if May pulls another stunt on 27 February. She said that date would be the MPs chance for a meaningful vote, but no one believes her any more, and people see it as yet another delaying tactic to run down the clock. With the establishment of the Independent Group, May can no longer hold her party hostage, as there is now an alternative for Tory MPs who don’t want to see their country damaged unnecessarily. The same goes for Labour. My advice to Corbyn is, support a second referendum NOW, or you will go down in history as the leader who presided over the annihilation of the Labour Party. TrueBrit1066Fabulous. Didn’t think I’d live to see the day that the Tories start to self immolate. Good for Britain and fabulously bad for Brexit. Finally some Tories with a bit of principle. Runeboy1This is all very interestingdramatic for the political journos etc, but does it really change anything? Does it change how they will vote on anything? If there was a vote of confidence in her majesty’s government tomorrow would these three vote against the government? Jack OliverWow. I know that (for example) Soubry and Umunna seemed closer to each other politically than many in their own parties but I never thought any Tories would defect – with them, party loyalty always seems to come first in the end. Timing is still odd though – it’s getting very late for them to have any influence on Brexit. If those three had just rebelled against their party a few more times, that could have made all the difference – they didn’t, but now they’re happy to leave completely. daveinbrumIf they do this it will be a massive moment in UK politics. I think we’ll see more centrist Labour MPs jump and then it might become a self perpetuating thing. The more centrists leave the Labour party the more it becomes a far left party so the more centrists will leave. kafkafanExcellent to see three principled Tories joining the principled Labour seven. These are brave politicians putting their careers on the line to reject the increasing dangerous polarisation of the main parties. I would almost certainly vote for such a candidate in any upcoming election. Lee_SmithThe SDP only attracted one Tory MP. There must, surely, be at least 30 Labour MPs who value the country of their own political careers stuck in a vehicle for the campaign group? There is a glimmer of hope at long last. It is small. It is likely it will be crushed by first past the post. But damn the Campaign group and damn the ERG. Leave them to their takeovers of the old parties. Let us have reason back.

Nearly a third of the food Britons eat comes from the EU.The fear is that long delays at ports, the introduction of high import and export tariffs and a lack of migrant workers to pick and process food could not just be highly disruptive, but sound the death knell for some British farmers, producers and retailers.Even the pro-Brexit environment secretary, Michael Gove, has admitted delays were likely in Calais – the port that handles most food heading from the EU to the UK – due to mandatory EU checks on food exports from the UK on the French side of the channel. That, he said, would have a knock-on effect on trucks and the turnaround of ferries heading back to the UK.On Tuesday he told the National Farmers’ Union annual conference in Birmingham that reports suggesting Britain would operate a zero-tariff regime in order to secure frictionless trade in a no-deal scenario were “not accurate”. He said the tariff regime Britain would like to apply in the event of no deal – most probably on meat, and especially lamb – would be revealed in the “next few days”.Gove promised British food standards would not be lowered “in pursuit of trade deals”, but UK producers fear a wave of lower standard imports – particularly from the US – could undercut them and reduce quality for shoppers.Retailers usually have only a few days’ food supplies in their distribution centres if they are not kept topped up. They have been stockpiling packet, tinned and frozen foods and are examining ways to increase the shelf life of the most perishable goods, taking on more chilled storage capacity and using varieties of perishables that last longer.Three-quarters of warehouse owners say their space is now full to capacity, according to a January survey by the UK Warehousing Association, whose 750 member operate 9.3m sq metres (100m sq ft) of space across the country. It is understood that frozen and chilled food warehouses, storing everything from garden peas to half-cooked supermarket bread and cold-store potatoes, are now fully booked until beyond April.But many company chiefs privately admit their main policy is to cross their fingers and hope that the UK signs a deal with the EU as soon as possible.Tesco and Marks \u0026amp SpencerBoth major retailers have said they are working with suppliers to stockpile packet and tinned foods. Tesco boss, Dave Lewis, said the retailer had been working with all its suppliers to build a plan for each category. But he warned that fresh foods would be a “pinch point” if there was no deal because they could not be stockpiled.With frozen and chilled warehouse storage space now fully booked, Tesco has taken an extra year’s lease on several hundred refrigerated containers, located in store car parks, which it usually has only at Christmas.The Bradford-based supermarket chain has applied and been accepted for authorised economic operator (AEO) status which enables simplified customs procedures and the possibility of fast-tracked shipments for importers. Other retailers may have applied for this status, but have not confirmed the move and it is currently reported to be taking up to 12 months to obtain AEO approval from HMRC.The wine merchants has stored 1m extra bottles of wine from France, Spain and Italy in case there are import problems or increases in duty post-Brexit.Pets at HomeThe listed pet store has stockpiled £8m of extra supplies, including dog and cat food.Both supermarkets signed a British Retail Consortium-backed letter calling on the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The letter said these companies were stockpiling but warned that retailers typically keep no more than two weeks’ inventory.The owner of Mr Kipling, Ambrosia and Sharwoods, has said it is spending £10m on Brexit preparations and has stockpiled both ingredients and its most popular products, such as Oxo cubes and Bisto gravy, to protect against port delays.The company behind Cadbury chocolates has been stockpiling ingredients as well as finished chocolates and biscuits.The Irish dairy company behind brands including Kerrygold and Pilgrims Choice, is stockpiling cheddar in the UK to ensure that its product can get to supermarket shelves and beat any shock price hike if the UK crashes out of the EU bloc on 29 March.The Anglo-Dutch conglomerate has said it is stockpiling large supplies of Magnum ice-creams in the UK amid concerns about importing them from its factories in Italy and Germany. Unilever has also been building up stocks of materials to make and package products including aluminium, plastics and propellants. In the spring, the vast majority of salads eaten in the UK are imported from southern Spain. Catering supplier Reynolds, has said it usually holds only 1.5 days of stock to ensure its product is fresh in stores. It is considering increasing its stocks on some products, such as tomatoes, but that is severely limited because its delicate products can deteriorate fast.Andy Weir of Reynolds said the company has been investigating using suppliers in other countries, such as Morocco and alternative ports to Dover and Calais, through which most salads are currently shipped. He is also looking at flying in product.However alternative ports add time and cost while flying in product is very costly. Weir has previously flown in lettuce from the US when bad weather in Spain hit supplies, but he said this was only a last resort.The main concern for soft fruit farmers is securing enough people to pick produce amid uncertainty over EU workers’ right in the UK after 29 March. Harry Hall at Hall Hunter Partnership, the UK’s biggest berry grower based across several sites in southern England, said the company currently had a good supply of seasonal workers and was assuring them it wouldsupport any bureaucratic changes.He said the company would also pay living and working conditions to encourage pickers to come. But he said a no-deal Brexit under which EU workers were excluded from the UK would be “armageddon”. “If that happens the whole country will come to a halt, forget the berries,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64cfa980f7ea373855c8568f6bf18c2b6aa78aa5/23_272_3406_2044/master/3406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d20be6360194552a5a0e0b677180197","title":"joan ryan becomes eighth labour mp to join independent group politics live","story":"Rolling updates on the day’s political developments as Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston defect from the Tory party to join the Independent GroupInteresting from the ’s political editor. Is the Labour party preparing for more resignations?Here’s the first photoshoot of the Independent Group all together.We never had this problem in the party before he was the leader. It comes with him, it is part of his politics, I am afraid. I think what’s changed in the last four weeks is that we’ve now seen a way that we can get a parliamentary majority for the withdrawal agreement – that seemed much more difficult before – and that is essentially to take the deal that we have on the table in its entirety, but make a simple but important change to the Northern Ireland backstop, but one that guarantees the future of the Belfast, Good Friday peace agreement.Linda Fabiani, a former Scottish National party minister, has been appointed to chair the special Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s botched handling of its investigation into sexual harassment complaints against Alex Salmond.At its inaugural meeting on Wednesday Labour and Tory members lodged formal objections to an SNP MSP chairing the committee, set up to investigate the actions of civil servants, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her special advisers before it emerged the inquiry was legally flawed.Salmond denies the allegations and mounted legal action against the government, which admitted in court last month the senior civil servant who led the internal inquiry into allegations against by two women had had prior contact with both complainants. The Scottish government agreed that gave the inquiry the appearance of bias.Sturgeon has since admitted she discussed the case five times with Salmond while her chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was instrumental in brokering the first meeting between Sturgeon and Salmond.Now a deputy presiding officer at Holyrood, Fabiani is one of three former SNP ministers on the committee was served under Salmond when he was first minister, as European affairs and culture minister from 2007 until 2009. Under Holyrood rules, it is the SNP’s turn to chair a new committee but the party has the right to step aside.Jackie Baillie, a Scottish Labour MSP on the committee, and Donald Cameron, for the Tories, said they did not doubt Fabiani’s probity but warned it could raise questions about the committee’s independence and transparency.The Liberal Democrats and Greens supported the SNP chairing the committee, which has now suspended its investigations until Salmond’s trial on 14 charges including attempted rape and sexual assault has finished. He denies all the charges. Looks like Lineker is a fan ...Wollaston says there is a very aggressive and well-funded social media campaign that has been waged against them. “It’s very clear to me that our associations are changing. We have people who are very clearly Ukip and they are turning the Conservative party to Blukip,” she says.Soubry says lots of Tory MPs are frightened of being deselected. They are not frightened of their electorate, but people in their associations, she says.Soubry says she stands by the Tory austerity policy after 2010 and that it was the right thing to do for the country. Wollaston says it is extraordinary that “just at the point when we can start to reverse austerity, we are knowingly and deliberately about to send ourselves back into an economic downturn”.Asked why they voted with the government on a no-confidence motion just a few weeks ago, Soubry says: “The last thing this country wants or needs is a general election.”Allen and Soubry say they would not rejoin the Conservative party. Heidi Allen says she had one text from a cabinet minister last night trying to persuade her not to leave, but Wollaston and Soubry say they’ve had nothing.Heidi Allen says the three MPs had run out of ammunition to persuade May to change her path on Brexit. “This is designed to be a wake-up call,” she says. “This is a taste of more to come.”Sarah Wollaston says that the new Independent Group is bigger than the DUP and the ERG – instead of constantly reaching out to those groups, Theresa May should reach out to them. Heidi Allen says there are lots of MPs who agree with them. She says they had no idea that the seven Labour MPs were planning their announcement, but decided to “pick up the baton” today.Anna Soubry says that they are appealing for everybody – even people who voted for Brexit – to join them. Moves to modernise the Tory party under Cameron have all been thrown away, she says, and it is now in the grip of the ERG.“I’m not leaving the Conservative party. It has left me,” she says. Soubry calls on other MPs to join them and says there are millions of people who support their values and who are tired of tribal politics.Soubry says you don’t join a political party to fight it. “The battle is over and the other side has won,” she says. “The rightwing, the hardline anti-EU awkward squad are running the Conservative party from top to toe.” She says that many of her friends in the party know “in their heads and in their hearts that it’s over”. “Brexit now defines the Conservative party.”She says her colleagues are being hounded in their constituency parties by infiltrators, even though they are supporting the prime minister’s deal. “It’s ironic that Conservatives observe it and condemn it in the Labour party, but it is happening in their own party.” Anna Soubry says the Conservative party has been very good to her. She says she had rejoined the party in 2002 as a single mother of two when it had started to modernise. “It is with a heavy heart that I have today resigned my membership of the Conservative party,” she says.Sarah Wollaston is up next. She says she wants to answer the questions of why now and what next. She says she wouldn’t have joined the Conservative party if it had looked then as it does now. “This is about more than Brexit. I joined the party after spending 24 years in the NHS as a frontline doctor wanting to make a difference,” she says. She joined a tolerant, modern open-hearted Conservative party, which has since disappeared, says Wollaston.She says the Conservatives were once the party most trusted on the economy but that they were now driving the country up to the cliff edge with their approach to Brexit.She says she feels excited in a way she hasn’t felt since she was elected, and a sense of liberation. “The United Kingdom deserves better,” she says.“Yes we are putting our heads above the parapet and we might fail, but isn’t the prize worth fighting for?”Heidi Allen has taken to the stage. She says that he we heard yesterday about “the magnificent seven”, then yesterday evening about the “lone ranger”. Now we are meeting the “three amigos”. “I am tired of feeling numb,” she says. “So today – alongside my wonderful colleagues – I have resigned from the Conservative party.”“I can no longer represent a party that can’t open its eyes to suffering in our society. Suffering that has deepened, when it was in our power to fix it.”The three MPs who this morning announced they had resigned from the Conservative party are now giving a press conference in Westminster. (You can watch the live stream at the top of this blog.) Ahead of the press conference by the Independent Group, here are some potted bios of who exactly is resigning from the Tory party.Anna Soubry was elected as MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire following the 2010 general election. She was elected onto the Justice Select committee later that summer. Soubry worked as a journalist until the mid-1990s, presenting regional and networked television programmes. She is a prominent supporter of the People’s Vote campaign.Sarah Wollaston had been a member of the Conservative Party since 2006. She was elected to represent Totnes, Devon in the 2010 general election. She later became the Chair of the Liaison Committee and the Health Select Committee. Wollaston practised as a GP until her election into parliament.Heidi Allen was elected to represent South Cambridgeshire in the 2015 general election. She used her maiden speech to criticise the government’s plan to cut tax credits. She was promptly elected onto the Work and Pensions Select Committee. In 2017 Allen failed to obtain a Conservative Party nomination for Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. Before entering parliament, Allen worked for RS Bike Paint Ltd, a company owned by her parents. Ian Blackford has asked an urgent question to the prime minister to set out the analysis the government has done on the economic impact of its proposed EU withdrawal deal. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general, says the government published its analysis on the economic impact of Brexit at the end of November. He says a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the economy. Blackford says it is clear from Stride’s answer that there has been no specific analysis of the withdrawal agreement. He says that economists are clear that the PM’s proposed deal would be disastrous for the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58ddb41b202177dadb423e82f34b6c8ad2623beb/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=084cd9e0308cab016ec09dcb0b8e0285","title":"britons urged to get flu vaccine as critical cases rise above 2000","story":"Virus has killed 200 and left many more in intensive care units over winter periodFlu has left more than 2,000 Britons needing life-or-death treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) this winter, even though the virus is circulating at unusually low levels.Senior doctors said as many people were at risk of dying as during the pandemics of 2009-10 and 2010-11, despite the small numbers contracting the virus.One leading expert said the strain of flu this winter was so virulent that it had left people who were previously fit and healthy critically ill, some of whom hospitals have been unable to save. Those who have not had this year’s winter flu vaccine appear to be most at risk.Pregnant women and adults with a long-term medical condition who contract the virus are most likely to end up struggling to breathe so badly that they could die, said Public Health England (PHE). This strain of flu is following a dangerously different pattern than usual, with comparatively few people visiting their GP about it but large numbers becoming so unwell they risk dying.In total, 2,182 people in the UK have had to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high-dependency unit (HDU) because of flu since the start of October. That is more than the 2,045 who needed such care in the same period last year, when the virus was much more prevalent. Flu has killed 195 this winter, though that is down on the 241 deaths that occurred in the same period in 2017-18.Dr Simon Ashworth, a consultant in intensive care at St Mary’s hospital in London, who has specialised in such care for 25 years, said: “This is the worst flu season I have ever known.” At least six of his ICU’s 32 beds have been taken up with flu patients since mid-December.The five NHS trusts in England that provide extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the highest level of lifesaving support available for patients who cannot breathe, have also had to use the technology in recent weeks on flu patients.Ashworth said: “Although the overall incidence of flu reported by Public Health England is, if anything, lower than last year, our experience at St Mary’s has been that we have seen more patients with severe influenza requiring intensive care than we saw even in 2010.“Colleagues from other hospitals have reported similar experiences, including those from ECMO centres, which have reported high levels of activity and running at close to capacity. Our impression is that patients who have ended up in ICU have generally not been vaccinated so even if the vaccine hasn’t been completely protective, it has reduced the risk of life-threatening infection.”Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, whose members help care for flu patients in hospital, said the unusual combination of low levels of the infection but high numbers of people left severely unwell could mean that it was proving deadlier this year.He said: “From the relatively lower rates of GP consultation and so far hospital admission compared to the higher levels of ICUHDU need and nearly 200 flu-related deaths, it could point to this year’s strain being particularly virulent and causing more extreme reactions in infected patients.“I would urge anyone who requires vaccination but has not had it yet to get vaccinated as circulating levels are still significant and the illness caused very severe.”At Leicester Hospitals trust, which is also an ECMO centre, more patients have needed ECMO to breathe since the last UK flu pandemics.Dr Chris Harvey, director of the trust’s paediatric and adult ECMO programme, said it had treated 42 patients in intensive care or high dependency and another 25 with ECMO, this winter.He said: “Since the start of December we have treated a total of 25 critically ill patients with ECMO support with confirmed influenza A in Leicester. This represents the highest number of flu patients we have managed with ECMO since the pandemics of 2009-10 and 2010-11.“All of our patients were previously fit and well and were rendered critically ill by the virus. None of these patients had been vaccinated against flu this year.”The most recent flu surveillance data, released by PHE last Thursday, showed that primary care services, mainly GP surgeries, were seeing low-intensity levels of the virus in the week ending 10 February. Only 23.1 people per 100,000 of population were reporting flu-like symptoms.Despite that, both the number of people admitted to hospital with flu, and those needing admission to an intensive care or high-dependency unit, were at high-impact levels. In that week alone, 269 people ended were sent to an ICU or HDU, compared with 177 last year.Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE’s head of immunisations, said: “Flu is having less of an impact this year than last. However, we know that we are seeing high hospital admission rates due to flu. The main strain circulating this season is A(H1N1)pdm09, which particularly tends to affect younger and middle-age adults.“At-risk groups who are affected by this strain, pregnant women and adults with long-term conditions, are at increased risk of more severe consequences of flu, which may be why we are seeing higher rates of ICU and HDU admissions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd97de3f442b2a5ecedce8551d1fb1f9260eeaa/140_368_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7504e0d9c7d40a1cd0dfe3255cb7a36b","title":"steve stricker confirmed as usa captain for 2020 ryder cup","story":"Tiger Woods has delivered a ringing endorsement of Steve Stricker’s appointment as the USA’s Ryder Cup captain. In the least surprising development of this golfing year, Stricker was confirmed in position by the PGA of America on Wednesday. He will seek to reclaim the cup from Europe at Whistling Straits next September.In Mexico City, where he was making final preparations for the WGC-Mexico Championship, Woods spoke effusively of his long-time friend. Woods was also part of the selection panel which chose the 51-year-old from Wisconsin.“He was the overwhelming choice by all of us on the committee,” said Woods. “All of us felt that it was his time, that he was deserving. What he has done as the leader both in the Presidents Cups and Ryder Cups has been tremendous and we just thought that with his leadership and the way the guys follow Stricks, that he would be the best captain there is for 2020. The players were unanimous, they wanted him on as their team leader and we felt the same way on the committee.“Everyone knows he’s such a nice guy but beneath all of that exterior is this fieriness and this competitiveness and he’s also one of the more detail oriented guys that we know of. I think that he’ll be prepared, he’ll be understanding and he’s very good at communicating with the players and getting their opinions but also putting his foot down when he has to. That’s an important job.”Stricker, who is the 29th man to lead the US, is also the first without a major win. Padraig Harrington was named as the European captain last month. In the here and now, Woods has focus on what would be a remarkable 19th World Golf Championship win. This marks his first competitive appearance in Mexico City.“I take a lot of pride in playing well in the biggest events,” added the 14-times major champion. “So that being obviously the majors, the Players and the World Golf Championships. I think my record has been pretty good in those events. So just because this event has been in different places, it still gets the best players in the world and I’ve always enjoyed competing against them and trying to beat them and win an event. I’ve had some success in World Golf Championships no matter where they’re played.”Woods wore a broad smile when admitting thoughts of the Masters started “back in October” but the serious element relates to this player, fully fit again, harbouring legitimate hopes of donning the Green Jacket once more.Woods’s schedule remains unclear after this week. A run of tournaments in Florida – the Honda Classic, Arnold Palmer Invitational, Players Championship and Valspar Championship - precede another World Golf Championship, this time the Match Play in Austin. The likelihood is Woods will skip the Honda and possibly Match Play.“From here on out, it’s very complicated,” Woods explained. “Next week’s at home for me, then there’s a tournament that I’ve won there eight times. Then another event that I’ve won a couple times. Then the week after that is where I had an unbelievable week last year. So it gets very complicated. That’s what I’m trying to figure out, how much to play, how much is too much, how much is not enough, and at the end of the day being race ready enough for April and making sure I get enough competitive rounds.“This year’s even more complicated than last year. I feel better but I’ve got four events right there in my state that I live in and it gets very complicated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55cfe3a79a07a1c467f9798b2ec76dc4a83f0e50/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=876075d8d26408dc6bc4547f812ae108","title":"how to catch a catfisher","story":"Last year, I found out someone was using my photos to catfish women. He stole dozens of my online photos – including selfies, family photos, baby photos, photos with my ex – and, pretending to be me, he would then approach women and spew a torrent of abuse at them.It took me months to track him down, and now I’m about to call him. I’m nervous, so much so that I have been putting it off for weeks.I sit down and dial. My palms are sweaty. He picks up.“Hi,” I say. “I’m looking to talk to Chris …”“This is Chris. Who am I talking to?” He already sounds pissed off.“I’m really glad I finally managed to talk to you.”“Who am I talking to?”“Sorry, Max who? Where are you calling from?”“OK, and how can I help you?”I first find out about my catfisher in March 2018, when a woman messages me on Twitter.Little do I know that from moment on, I will fall down a rabbit hole of online fakery, which will include setting up a fake Instagram account, buying followers, buying likes, even changing my gender on Tinder.After receiving that first message, I try to forget about it, thinking people will report him and that Facebook and Instagram will suspend his account.But about two weeks later, I receive a message on Twitter from a different woman:Each seems to have reported him, and I can’t find his profile anywhere. So what is there to do? Again, I just hope that his account has been suspended.Two months later it happens for the fourth time, and it’s the worst one yet. A woman has tweeted a screenshot from a Facebook conversation her friend had with the catfisher. A stream of vile abuse is coming out of my grinning face. I am mortified. At this point, I decide to track him down and tell him to stop.How do you track down someone when you don’t know who they are? I start with the only lead I have. The first woman to contact me had attached a screenshot of the catfisher’s Instagram account when he had the username @jjmason90.This account was now inactive, meaning I couldn’t find it through a normal Instagram search. But after searching the username on Google, I was able find an unofficial Instagram site redirecting from @jjmason90 to @johnnysanders90. He had switched his name to John Sanders, creating a new page while keeping all the same photos. He was using a recently taken photo of me as his avatar.John follows 1,900 people and, terrifyingly, has 280 followers. That’s 280 people who think he’s me. But it’s his bio that really takes the piss: Simple, laid-back and educated guy who enjoys having fun, trying new things and meeting new people it reads. Get to know me.He has posted 153 photos, but his profile is private. If I’m going to find out what he has been doing with my photos, he would have to accept my follow request. But if I add him from my account, he could end up blocking me and changing his handle again, meaning I may never stop him. Getting a friend to add him would also be too risky – he might see a photo of us together.That’s when it dawns on me: I’m going to have to catfish him.I contact Facebook, which owns Instagram. Is it OK to catfish a catfisher? “Misrepresenting yourself is against our policies,” their spokesperson replies. “We have a dedicated team that’s tasked with helping to detect and block this kind of activity.”But will I be banned if I pose as someone else to stop an abusive catfisher, ie do it for the good of the internet? “I get what you mean,” the spokesperson replies. “I just want to clarify here, that any impersonation – no matter the motive – will be dealt with the same.”OK. So, I can’t impersonate a person but … what if I invent a fake business that caters directly to his interests?From what I’ve gleaned, my catfisher is from Oklahoma and likes beautiful and sexy, women. (I know this because I have found comments he has left on random women’s Instagram posts. One says beautiful, the other sexy).With my bot army in formation, my next move is to up the ante with John, and start geo-targeting him – a feature of Instagram used mostly by brands to advertise their posts to their target customers. So I pay Instagram $64 (£50) and it pushes a post targeting men between the ages of 18 and 30 in a 15-mile radius of Oklahoma city centre.Some men take the bait. One even comments, writing: Im from okc wus poppin. But John isn’t among them. I give up trying to make him follow me, and request to follow him. He never accepts.Defeated and getting desperate, I decide to go on my Tinder account and change my gender to female and my location to Oklahoma City. I swipe through hundreds of straight men looking for someone with my face, on the off chance John is still using my photos. But it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack or, more accurately, a catfish in an ocean of topless men with names such as Brad and Tyler.But then I remember the beautiful and sexy comments he left on two women’s accounts. What if they had followed him back after he randomly added them?I find their profiles – they’re public – and search who they follow.And sure enough, he’s there. This could be it. I finally have a solid lead.One of the women who follows John and has access to his account messages back and sends me screenshots, showing photos of me dispersed among dozens of random memes, like Kanye West with Trump\u0027s hair and a frog clinging onto a stick.Each scroll brings a new wave of dread and confusion. Who would steal someone’s baby photos and pass them as their own? I decide I need help from an expert.I contact Social Catfish, a social media investigation service based in California. They have an image search tool – like Google Images but more powerful – which can help me find any other accounts my catfisher has set up with my photos.According to her, catfishing scammers get their photos from Googling terms such as “intelligent man with glasses” or “white man in suit”. In my case she thinks my catfish just wants to be able to talk to women and say whatever he wants. But why my face? I ask. She pauses awkwardly. “Because … you’re attractive,” she says. Thanking her, I explain that there’s no way I can mention that in my article.I send Linnie my photos and she puts them through Social Catfish’s search tool to see if John has been using them anywhere else besides Instagram. He hasn’t, but what I discover is even more disturbing. Another guy is selling sneakers as me in Ohio. Another man is putting out a casting call on a crowdsourcing website with my face. Two men have written Yelp reviews with, yep, my face as their avatars.Unfortunately, Social Catfish can’t figure out John Sanders’ true identity either. I thank them, and start to think I should give up.But before I do, I have one final go. I start by going back over all the women’s messages to make sure I haven’t missed anything. And … it turns out I have.My catfisher’s real name has been sitting in my Twitter inbox all along. In the flurry of messages I had forgotten the first woman had actually guessed his name. I feel so stupid, but when she had first contacted me I had never intended to write anything about it. I was confused, and it was months before I decided to do anything.How did she know who he was?I Google Chris’s full name and find two Facebook accounts and his Instagram. They’re all private.But then I come across a Google+ group. It has been set up to expose abusive behavior online. In 2016, someone posted screenshots of Chris.Things get even more disturbing. A few months later, a young woman called Lizzie responded to the post.Along with the post she has uploaded 33 photos. They’re all of Chris, and most of them are selfies where he’s smiling or goofing around. As I scroll through them, an opening ceremony of red flags marches through my head. I upload her photo to the Google Images search tool, and this headline comes up:“She went missing from a sheriff’s station. Now the state wants answers.”The photo is of Mitrice Richardson, a 24-year-old grad student from California. She went missing in 2009, and her remains were found a year later. I don’t think Chris has murdered anyone. But he has used a dead woman’s photo to defensively catfish people accusing him of abuse.I give Social Catfish Chris’ name and the photos I can find of him. From public records they’re able to get his home address. He lives in the midwest and, from public records, they are able to find his phone number.“Chris, I’m calling because someone has been using my photos on the internet and, please correct me if I’m wrong, but I heard it was maybe ... you?”“No, it definitely wasn’t me. I have my own profile with my own pictures.”I try to reassure him so he doesn’t hang up. I’m not trying to get him into trouble. I’m writing a piece about what he has done, but I won’t be using his real name. I just want to talk, get some closure.“There’s quite strong evidence you’ve been using my photos, so I just want to talk to you. I’m not angry or anything,” I say.He denies it again, but then slips up. “I have my own social media profiles, my own Facebook, my own Instagram,” he says. “I was friends with somebody who it turned out that they were using someone else’s pictures, because I thought it was a real profile so I was friends with them for a bit. But then I reported the account when I found out it was fake.”“That may be true,” I say, “but my understanding is that you created an account called Jim Mason, and then it evolved to John Sanders.” He interrupts me and continues denying any involvement. We go round and round in circles. What about the woman who he followed around the exact same time as the catfish? What are the chances of that?I follow a lot of accounts, he says. Over the next hour that’s his go-to defence. (He follows just under 7,500 people, the maximum allowed by Instagram.)I start to worry I’ll never get the satisfaction of a confession, but then I remember the memes he posted in between the many pictures of me.There were so many memes on the John Sanders Instagram page. Chris has a private account. What if he had posted the same memes on his personal page?After about half an hour of going back and forth, I casually ask Chris if I can follow him on Instagram. I can almost hear the calculations he’s making in his head over the phone. It could look suspicious if he says no, but can he remember what he has posted? Was it similar? Does he have time to check?He says yes, and I’m in.I make small talk while frantically taking screenshots of all of his photos. There’s more than 1,000. I hold my landline phone with my right hand and my iPhone with my left, while using my right elbow to click the button on its side, going down his entire grid. Before we end our conversation, I try pleading with him. Just tell me, I say, it will be between us. I won’t use your real name, I just need the closure. He denies everything.But I have my smoking gun. On Chris’ account and the catfisher’s account are four of the exact same memes, all posted in the same order, around the same time.I message Chris to see if he’s free to talk again. He says I can call him later that evening. There’s no way out for him now. I can’t wait for him to finally confess.But then there’s a shift. He seems to sense something. An hour before we’re due to talk, he messages again.“After giving it further thought I’ve decided that I no longer wish to be contacted regarding the story you’re doing or any other matter. I feel that I have given more than enough information and answered a ton of questions last time we spoke. Please respect my privacy and do not attempt to contact me further. Thank you.”I wanted him to know what he did has consequences, for me and all the women he tricked and abused. There’s little I can do now he has blocked me, but he knows I’m writing this, and I’m almost certain he’s going to read it. I hope he can become a better person, rather than feeling like he has to be someone else completely.At almost the exact same moment Chris blocks me, I receive a message in my “other” inbox on Instagram, where messages from accounts you don’t follow go. It’s from an obviously fake account with a young blonde woman as its avatar. Her username is a garble of letters. “Hi! How are you?” she asks. I start to reply. The timing is so suspicious. Could this be another rabbit hole Chris sends me down?But then I catch myself. I’m done. I don’t need to do this. I close Instagram and put my phone away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1f7c2c142d844d7c7951ba1fe1b7cb19a9556f4/0_233_5049_3029/master/5049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=effc9c3bf3f12967afbd6e809e5246fe","title":"send us a tip on places to see early spring flowers in the uk and win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about wild flowers and colourful displays of early spring blooms in the countryside and gardens open to the publicWe want to hear about great places you’ve enjoyed spring flowers in the UK.

The idea (more information at preservefaroeislands) is that tourists and locals collaborate on marking paths, creating signs and improving access to beauty spots that have become a success on Instagram. Lord of the Rings-style mountains, cute puffins and shaggy, shaggy sheep that come in dozens of different shades have made this a favourite destination for social media influencers. They fall for its quaintness: turf-roofed houses, dramatic waterfalls and misty Avalon-style landscapes.Getting people to notice the islands has been a mission for Hojgaard and her team at Visit Faroe Islands. They came up with a successful campaign entitled Sheep View, which had sheep running around the islands with a camera strapped to their backs in an effort to persuade Google to include the islands in its Street View search facility. It worked: the archipelago is now on Google Street View and the tourist board won awards for what marketing experts say was the tourism industry’s most successful viral campaign – more than 5 billion online hits. Last year, they came up with another viral campaign, which featured islanders translating phrases live for anyone around the world who wanted to hear a local speaking to them in Faroese.The result of all this is that many Faroese people want to make sure the destination doesn’t start suffering from the over-tourism that has seen Iceland buckle under the strain of hosting more than two million visitors each year. The Faroes’ 18 islands are nowhere near suffering the same fate but in summer it’s hard to get a hotel room. Two new hotels are under construction in the tiny capital, Tórshavn, and the national airline Atlantic Airways has announced it will be flying three times a week to Paris in high season. It flies twice-daily to Copenhagen already, twice-weekly to Edinburgh and three times a week to Iceland.As for that wind-dried fermented mutton, it’s quite tasty once you get used to eating meat with a decidedly cheesy flavour. “We want people to experience the genuine culture of the Faroes,” says Hojgaard. “And wind-dried lamb is one of our national dishes. It’s important to us that we don’t change who we are just because more outsiders want to experience out natural, unspoiled environment.”The new campaign is as much about getting Faroese people behind tourism as it is about getting tourists to do something useful when they visit. Maybe, it’s the Viking ancestry that makes the Faroese so practical, although the Nordic invaders weren’t especially famed for their hospitality they were good at making a life on remote rocky islands in the North Atlantic, though.Tim Ecott is writing a book about the Faroe Islands due out later this year"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce9dc38e9b8dfb472f169e8f626bfd4fdeebb22c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8d89f9d3ef8daaec1e9634bf892b185","title":"pure reviewed by people with ocd channel 4","story":"Is it too tame, too perverse or does it just miss the point?

You can see she’s disoriented, but it doesn’t show the rock-bottom distress – not knowing how you’re going to carry on living your life with these thoughts in your mind.To me, harming children is the very worst thing you could do. Imagine having that in your head all the time, without being able to turn it off. In the show, Marnie has moved to London and she’s out socialising. I spent a lot of my youth lost. I wanted to be a primary school teacher, but obviously that idea went out the window. I used to try and shut myself up. I just wanted to feel normal I wanted to be like everyone else. I remember banging my head against walls sometimes, trying to make it stop. You don’t get any of that in Pure.Marnie’s OCD gets pointed out by someone she’s just met, and it makes it seem so easy. I was originally diagnosed with anxiety, but it never made sense. Later, I went to an OCD support group and a woman said, “I have sexually intrusive thoughts and sometimes they’re about children.” That was the moment for me. To have somebody say it out loud, in a room full of people, blew my mind. I almost feel bad for criticising Pure, because I’m really happy it’s out there. It makes me hopeful about what could come.There are a lot of shows about obsessive-compulsive cleaning, where it feels like the main purpose is to entertain at the expense of the sufferer. But with Pure, you feel empathy towards the character with OCD. I didn’t like that it’s a comedy drama, because there is nothing comical when you’re in that situation. I often feel very alone and worry that nobody understands. There’s a lot of shame, too, but overall, Pure tells the story in a respectful way.Marnie figures out she has OCD when she’s told, “Obsessions manifest as recurring intrusive thoughts which are disturbing thoughts, images or ideas.” After she hears this, she’s jumping around with joy. I could relate, because I’d only opened up to two friends about what I was going through before I got my diagnosis. I had visitors over when I got the letter and read it standing on my balcony in the darkness. It was way past midnight and I had tears running down my face out of relief. I felt like, ‘now I can get treatment, I can tackle this, I can find my own people’. That is also the message of Pure: you’re not alone if you’re suffering from a mental illness. There are lots of other people out there you just need to look for them.I’m not convinced Pure captured OCD. Marnie’s intrusive thoughts just dissipate, like miniature hallucinations, and she carries on with life. There’s no single experience of OCD, but one of the hallmarks of intrusive thoughts is how long-lasting they are. It’s what makes them different from the unwanted thoughts everyone has. Mine are like a story I have to keep repeating to prevent catastrophe. Before I got treatment, I could spend hours reseating passengers in imaginary plane crashes to lower the body count. It was incredibly time-consuming.It sounds perverse, but I kept thinking how well-adjusted Marnie is for someone with untreated OCD. Like the character, I moved to London in my 20s before being diagnosed. I was obsessed with only eating the ‘right’ food and lost so much weight I could wear children’s clothes. Some of the sanest people I know have OCD, but it can have a devastating effect. One consequence the show did capture well was the impact of distracting compulsions on Marnie’s career. Even with an understanding employer, it’s challenging to explain, because what can you say? “Sorry, I can’t concentrate today, I’m too busy preventing another Tube bombing with my brain.”The show should have been braver about injecting gallows humour. A lot of the comedy is about people being awkward, not what it’s like to have your life fall to pieces. Marnie struggles, but the writers never let her get too despondent. If you’re going to make a comedy about a debilitating mental illness, you may as well be ruthless about it.Pure is on All 4 now. Some names have been changed.

His campaign said that Sanders raised more than $6m by 9am on Wednesday, and that supporters had contributed $600,000 in donations that will recur each month, an amount that should raise at least another $6.6m ahead of the first caucuses and primaries next year.At the start of the 2020 campaign, many Democrats have disavowed donations from corporate Pacs and are emphasizing the importance of small-dollar donations, an early litmus test of strength and grassroots energy in a crowded field. With Sanders’ entry in to the race on Tuesday, 12 candidates are now seeing the Democratic nomination – with decisions expected to follow from former vice-president Joe Biden, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.Sanders, who has near-universal name recognition and one of the largest fundraising lists in US politics, raised far more than many of the other 2020 candidates after their campaign launches.By comparison, Senator Kamala Harris raised more than the $1.5m in the first 24 hours of her campaign. Harris had been the biggest first-day fundraiser in the race so far and matched what Sanders’ raised in April 2015 after he launched his bid for the nomination that year. Meanwhile, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar’s campaign said she raised more than $1m in the 48 hours after launching her presidential bid this month. Sanders, a self-styled Democratic socialist who spent much of his nearly 30-year congressional career on the political fringe, launched his campaign on Tuesday morning, casting his candidacy as the best way to accomplish the mission he started four years ago when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.“Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,” he said in an email announcing his decision to supporters. “Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.”Sanders, 77, running as a Democrat again, believes he can prevail in a crowded and erse field that includes several female and minority candidates, and then beat Donald Trump, whom he called on Tuesday “the most dangerous president in modern American history”.The progressive policies Sanders helped popularize in 2016 – Medicare for All, a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, tuition-free college, demands to fight climate change more aggressively and to tax the wealthy at a higher rate – have now been broadly embraced by several other presidential candidates.Asked in an interview on CBS on Tuesday morning what would be different about his 2020 campaign, Sanders replied: “We’re gonna win.”However, whether he can once again capture grassroots support, and whether the energy of his past campaign will pass to other candidates, will likely be a central factor in determining who Democrats nominate to take on the sitting president at the next election. His campaign believes his initial fundraising haul is an early sign that he can.A series of early Sanders hires for top roles are intended to illustrate his campaign’s commitment to demographic and geographic ersity.Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, will serve as campaign manager. The 39-year-old former aide to Harry Reid will be the first Muslim to manage a presidential campaign. The campaign also hired the progressive organizer Analilia Mejia to be the political director and the activist Sarah Badawi to be her deputy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b02c7e5ca5ad2555064214210ccb9e9307d7001/92_530_4661_2796/master/4661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90f7ccdd15850478be8642730e91d277","title":"florida lawyer stages trial marriage proposal","story":"Brandon Dinetz proposed to Jennifer Lettman, who was in the courtroom gallery, under the pretense of opening statementsA love of the law has translated into a lifelong love for two Florida attorneys, with the world watching. A video of Brandon Dinetz proposing to Jennifer Lettman, both of Palm Beach county,has captured the hearts of internet viewers. In it, Lettman sat in the gallery of a courtroom under the pretense of watching Dinetz’s opening statements for a DUI case. In the video, the jury of her peers (that is, her family and friends) enters, and Dinetz begins to give an opening statement as Lettman starts to cry, suspecting the plot of the trial is a bit more personal than professional.“I heard noises behind me of her starting to freak out,” Dinetz said in a phone interview about the special moment. “She started to cry it was a laugh-cry and then it was all crying. Then she saw all of her friends and colleagues and she knew exactly what was happening at that point. Her reaction was priceless.”When Dinetz finally asked the big question, Lettman gave an enthusiastic yes – at which point the judge banged his gavel and “sentenced” them to life.The pair met in 2016 as assistant state attorneys in the Palm Beach county offices. Lettman now practices at a private firm, but the two still occasionally watch each other present cases and ask each other for feedback on their performances.For five months, the prosecutor planned the proposal, creating a unique ring, coordinating family and friends and even asking a judge and criminal defense attorney to volunteer to make the ruse more convincing. Video of the proposal, which took place on 7 February, went viral. “The next thing I know is we’re getting texts from friends and family that all of these different sites had it and we were like: ‘Well, this is pretty cool.’”Dinetz says he didn’t expect the online reaction. Despite the attention, the prosecutor said the video going viral was not at all his primary focus. “It’s cool that it’s getting attention but to me, the proposal itself is what’s most important … I am going to be married to Jen. That’s really what matters to me.”But he does want everyone to know just one thing: “Not a single taxpayer dollar was spent in the making.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Varadkar: Inquiry under consideration but priority is service for those children affectedSunday Business Post editor cross-examined over alleged defamation of businessmanSpokesman says win is \u0026lsquodream come true\u0026rsquo for \u0026lsquonormal family\u0026rsquo from DublinPeter Lavery scooped \u0026pound10m on the British lottery, but received 14,000 begging lettersTrial at Special Criminal court began in January 2018 and collapsed over a year laterPope says people who spend their lives denouncing the church are \u0026lsquofriends of the devil\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoTragic consequences\u0026rsquo of treatment failings emerge after family sues over mother\u0026rsquos deathStrategic Housing Development scheme being used accelerate the development processOne in four people deficient in Vitamin D during winter months, Tilda study findsThe longest marathon doubles tennis record, of 62 hours completed at Fitzwilliam clubOireachtas Justice group hears submissions from experts on reform of family law systemLeo Varadkar says debate over homeless services shows they have improvedIndependent Senator Brian \u0026Oacute D\u0026oacutemhnaill before court on foot of debt owed to SipoFormer RUC officer tells film-maker military behind plot to attack Catholic school in Co ArmaghThere is no chance of \u0026lsquoliving off the interest\u0026rsquo when rates are rock-bottom, says expertTaoiseach says screening programme group did good job but carried out a \u0026lsquobotched audit\u0026rsquoPSNI pursuing \u0026lsquomultiple lines of inquiry\u0026rsquo after farmer (52) killed in shotgun attack"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3800430.1550677907!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former davis cup players enter guinness book of records","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe four tennis players who set the new Guinness World Record LR - David Mullins, James Cluskey, Daniel O’Neill and Luke Maguire.Four Irish men have officially set a new world record for the longest ever doubles tennis match.The Guinness Book of Records has approved the record set by former Davis Cup players, David Mullins and James Cluskey and Daniel O’Neill and Luke McGuire from Trinity Tennis Club. They clocked up 62 hours of play at Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin last July.Having reviewed the detailed submission including 62 hours of video tape, the Guinness Book of Records announced on Wednesday that they had approved the submission for the longest marathon doubles tennis record.The four stopped playing with a scoreline of 77 sets to 72.The record event was a fund-raiser for the Enjoy Tennis programme which has to date enabled almost 1,000 players with a disability to learn and play the game in 70 clubs around Ireland. The attempt has raised almost €20,000 for Enjoy Tennis.James Cluskey said he was “absolutely delighted for the record to be ratified” adding: “Looking back for me our mental toughness and resilience got us through. We had a plan and for the most part we stuck to that plan. I think the support of the other players, volunteers and our families really helped us and there is no way we could have done it alone.”Dan O’Neill also paid tribute to “ the other guys, my parents and friends, combined with the incredible knowledge of our trainer, Leo Daniel Ryan”.

File photograph: Getty ImagesMinister for Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone has said there could be “bilateral agreements” between Ireland and the UK to ensure there is mutual recognition of qualifications between the jurisdictions following Brexit. Ms Zappone said the recognition of professional qualifications into the future “poses a particular challenge”. “The greatest source of potential impact, for areas covered by my department, would be in relation to those qualifications relevant to social work, given the ongoing drive for the recruitment of social workers by Tusla,” she said. “However, the risk associated with any ergence in qualifications is currently considered to be low.” Ms Zappone was addressing the Oireachtas committee on Children and Youth Affairs on Tuesday about the potential impact of Brexit on young people.She said the Department of Education and Department of Foreign of Affairs are working to ensure that in a no-deal context “we will be able to have mutual recognition of qualifications”. “Some of that I think will be referenced in relation to the Bill that we will be publishing but anything that’s not required for a legislative basis, my understanding that in this case as with other issues that we wish to ensure as much as opportunity as possible for our young people, that there could be appropriate bilateral agreements effectively between the jurisdictions,” she said. Ms Zappone said “we are dealing with a shortage of social workers”, adding that there is a global shortage. Social worker vacancies“Tusla is well aware of that and has to accept that and still move forward in terms of finding new solutions to those recruitment challenges,” she said. “I think it’s important to say too that the recognition of qualification only arises in the case obviously of newly qualified workers.”Cormac Quinlan, Tusla’s director of policy and strategy, said there are a number of approved courses that are set out for social work under the Health and Social Care Act. Mr Quinlan said there shouldn’t be “any blockages to anyone” even in a no-deal Brexit of being able to apply through Coru to have qualifications recognised in Ireland. Separately, the committee heard the former Labour party leader Pat Rabbitte will appear before it next Wednesday to discuss his new role as chairman of Tusla.

That’s the impression Leo gives every time questions about the national children’s hospital come up. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinWon’t be long now before Bob comes to the rescue, freeing Leo from the daily drudge of the same questions about the national children’s hospital from the same Opposition dimwits who don’t want to listen to his answers and won’t give him respect.That would be Bob, also known as Brexit Omnibus Bill. Omnibus Bill will be formally introduced to the nation on Friday and his arrival should shunt most of the unwanted hospital attention away from the Taoiseach for a while.What’s the big deal about it anyway? That’s the impression Leo gives every time the subject comes up. As he sees it, we have a simple Over-Under building situation: his critics say the cost of the hospital has massively overrun, he says the cost of the hospital has merely been underestimated. It’s the same thing, just approached from opposite directions. Why will nobody listen to him? He knows absolutely why: spin.The Taoiseach seemed very frustrated on Tuesday when he took to the floor for Leaders’ Questions, having to give answers he has given more than once already about how the project is turning out to be far more expensive than originally thought. It’s not as if the vast sums of money people are complaining about have even been spent yet, he pointed out, again. And when it is spent (and more besides), that cash will represent only a small billion or so drop in a multi-billion euro ocean, or envelope, as they like to call these things around Government Buildings. He cannot fathom the fuss. He rounded on an Opposition which, he charged, is interested only in “spin . . . yarns” and “conspiracy theories”. And to think he was in Lisbon (for the benefit of the Opposition dimwits and media dullards, that’s the capital of Portugal) just a few days earlier from where he tweeted matter-of-factly about having “Caught up with Portuguese PM Antionio Costa over the weekend for a good talk” on the impending European elections, the “ever-closer” relationship between Ireland and Portugal and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.Micheál, Mary Lou and Mattie may have been annoyed about the children’s hospital, but the political correspondents lobby was furious about the lack of transparency surrounding this bi-lateral in Lisbon, having received no notification of the meeting or subsequent information about what the two leaders discussed. This was viewed as a disappointing breach of long-standing protocol and a worrying precedent.Communications But there isn’t much you can tell the Taoiseach which he doesn’t already know, particularly when it comes to communications, an area in which he holds a particular interest. So when Micheál Martin took a swipe at the Government’s determination to “control the message around the overspend” as opposed to controlling the cost overruns, it didn’t play well. The Fianna Fáil leader believes the Government became so obsessed with the PR value around launching this much-needed hospital that it completely overlooked the building management costs.He pointed to all the publicity involved – “the Government was good on the hard hats, it was good on the yellow vests. It was good on the videos, YouTube, you name it there was no lack of communications around this hospital right from the get-go,” he said. Even before the detailed design was worked out, it was a case of “get it on the ground, get boots on the ground, get it working from the public relations perspective”. Conspiracy theoriesBut the Taoiseach had a good answer. There are no politicians or no political advisers on any of the boards or committees overseeing the development. “I think, once again, this sounds like one of your conspiracy theories, deputy Martin.” Wearily, he turned to the Ceann Comhairle and sighed about how Opposition members repeatedly “put out a yarn, perpetuate it for days in the media and when they are about to be found out, they shout you down”.Micheál came back with a zinger. “Taoiseach, you’re correct – the politicians weren’t on the board . . . they weren’t in the sub-committees. But they were in all the photographs, they were in all the videos, they were in every communication presentation for this hospital.” As for yarns, noisy TDs across the floor were not going to be taking any lectures from Varadkar’s Government about spinning the news. In that regard, the Dáil chamber is an assembly of the guilty. Then Micheál reminded Leo about the inidual who was in charge of the Department of Health when a very rosy estimate was advanced of how much the children’s hospital would cost. “When you’re talking about yarns, Taoiseach, the biggest yarn we heard in the last three years was in 2016 when you, as minister for health, said it’s €650 million all in! . . . It’s now €1.7 billion and climbing. So don’t talk to anybody here about yarns, Taoiseach, because people are quite frankly fed up with yarns and fed up with the public relations and fed up with the spin. They want substance and they want facts.”And the argument spin spun again, this time with the Fine Gael leader accusing the Fianna Fáil leader of spin and the Sinn Féin leader saying that the Minister for Health was spinning every bit as much as his boss whereupon the Taoiseach accused Mary Lou of spinning “all over the country” and Mattie McGrath called him a “spinning machine”.Leo says the cost overrun at the hospital is now being cited by Opposition TDs as the reason why local projects are being shelved or delayed, when the reason is completely unrelated. Which is entirely believable.“What is happening in here,” he railed, “is pure cynical spin from the Opposition.” You’d miss the innocence of Brexit. Bring on Omnibus Bill and Bob.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsFileTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended the Minister for Health after Fianna Fáil leader Michael Martin accused Simon Harris of attempting to destroy the reputation of the CervicalCheck team.Mr Varadkar said those who worked in the the cancer screening programme “did a good job” in developing the programme and saving thousands of lives.But he said “they also made a lot of mistakes” including carrying out a “botched audit, which had significant retrospection bias and then (they) did not share information about the audit with the women affected”.He also declined to give a date for the introduction of HPV testing, originally scheduled for the end of this year.“The dates I was given in the past by CervicalCheck and Department of Health could not be delivered,” he said.The Taoiseach was responding in the Dáil during Leaders’ Questions after Mr Martin sharply criticised Mr Harris over his remarks in an RTÉ radio interview.The Fianna Fáil leader said the extent to which Mr Harris had “dumped” in that interview on a group of people who had built up the cancer screening service over 10 years was unacceptable.Mr Martin said he had asked questions about the chief medical officer’s (CMO) support for the free test and was told that “the CMO’s advice was reflected in the Minister’s press release”.“What kind of gobbledegook is that?” he asked. “Did the CMO recommend this or not? I don’t believe he did.” He said he believed it was a case of “covering tracks” and “studied obfuscation”.Mr Varadkar said it was his understanding that the CMO supported the test.The Taoiseach also defended the free smear test offer and said it was to give reassurance to tens of thousand of women. He acknowledged that it had caused problems and there was a backlog. But this was not just because of the free screening but also because more women were attending for screening.Mr Martin has repeatedly insisted that Mr Martin went against clinical advice to offer a free out-of-cycle smear test to thousands of women in the wake of the CervicalCheck controversy, which resulted in an additional 90,000 tests last year and a current backlog of 78,000. Mr Martin called on the Taoiseach to confirm that the CervicalCheck team communicated its opposition to the provision of a free tests directly to the Department of Health at a high level before the decision was made.The CervicalCheck team did exceptional work over a decade in building up the service and in saving thousands of lives, “irrespective of one’s views on the terms of the decision around the audit”.He said “you can’t destroy the reputation and work of people who have committed to this programme for over a decade and many people are dismayed at the cavalier dismissal of the work” by Mr Harris.The Taoiseach acknowledged that those who built CervicalCheck did a good job.“I remember before CervicalCheck that women would present much later with cancer and with much more advanced cancer,” he said.

During the summer monsoon, it becomes too dangerous to pass.  When Dr Biraj Karmacharya, head of community programmes at a sprawling university hospital in the eastern town of Dhulikhel, arrived ten years ago, he could only do so after an arduous hike on foot.It was a time when medical emergencies could barely be treated, let alone any meaningful public health projects be carried out.However, today, hundreds of women in the villages dotting the steep slopes of Kavre have been drawn into a life-changing sexual and reproductive healthcare system through a unique microfinancing scheme that also helps to fund their vegetable growing and animal rearing businesses.The sun rises over Solumbu\u0026#39s stunning mountain ranges in NepalWomen like Harka Kumari Giri, 45, who not only received a three-year loan of 10,000 Nepali rupees (£67) from the health centre to grow and market vegetables, but also the diagnosis and treatment for uterine prolapse, a common problem in the area because of the high number of home births.“I didn’t know what was wrong with me,” said the mother of four. “The programme has definitely changed women’s lives as they can now go to the health centre when they have problems,” she added.“Why not take this opportunity to lengthen your life?” said Mrs Giri. “Previously we used to feel too uncomfortable to talk about our health issues, but now everyone speaks up.”The brainchild of Dr Karmacharya, the microfinancing project is one-of-a-kind in Nepal and remains relatively uncommon globally as a combination of the fight against poverty with the pursuit of improved community health.“Microfinance to us is a means, a bridge for us to enter into communities. It has really facilitated a lot of our work,” said Dr Karmacharya.Harka Kumari Giri, 45, received a three-year loan of 10,000 Nepali rupees (£67) from the health centre to grow and market vegetables – as well as the diagnosis and treatment for uterine prolapseWhen he first began to visit remote Nepali villages, he quickly learned that health issues took second place to financial concerns.“One thing we realised was that in order to have a long-term relationship with the community, to engage them in health in a sustainable way, we had to devise another approach than preaching to them,” he said.Families needed to prioritise basic survival and their children’s education, while women shied from asking their husbands for money for health checks or from mentioning gynaecological problems.Dr Karmacharya opted to try microfinancing as a way to grant women financial independence and the opportunity for regular health checks and education.“It was a wild idea,” he said, but he managed to secure foreign, mainly European, donors for the project. “We thought that it will financially empower them and that it will get the women organised, that the power centre in the communities will be changed.”The microfinancing project the brainchild of Dr Karmacharya and is a one-of-a-kind in NepalSince it began in 2008, the scheme has provided more than 1,000 women with small loans ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 Nepali Rupees (£67-169) over a period of three to four years.The money is used to fund the growing of marketable vegetables like beans, cauliflower, tomatoes and cucumber, or to raise poultry, goats and pigs that can also be used to raise household incomes.The participants, ided into small groups of ten, have monthly accounting meetings to arrange the loan repayment, which takes place at six-month intervals at an interest rate of two to four per cent.The women are also required to attend a monthly health education class where they can speak openly about medical issues and receive vital check-ups like cervical cancer screenings.Sabitri Maya Lama, 50, who lives in the tiny village of Dilaghara, is the leader of one of the current 55 groups active across the country.Sabitri Maya Lama, 50, is leader of a women\u0026#39s community group in Kafle village and also runs her own tomato farmSitting in the bright winter sunshine, under a gently fluttering string of colourful Himalayan prayer flags, Mrs Lama said that 19 months into the loan cycle, her tomatoes, cauliflowers and peas had been successful at the market, and provided nutritious food for her family.“Previously we had to buy our vegetables from Kathmandu. Now I don’t have to ask my husband for money,” she said.In addition to financial profits and free agricultural training, the women had benefited from increased self-confidence, said Mrs Lama.Wives and mothers who had previously existed alone in the shadows, speaking only in a local dialect, were now bold enough to speak publicly in Nepali. Their new assertiveness, borne through group support, has helped them to deal with local men who accused them of neglecting their housework.“We are united, so they can’t create any problems,” she laughed.But Mrs Lama admitted that some worried about loan repayments when their vegetables did not sell.Anita Ghatani, 18, with her six-month-old son Anand in Kafle villageThe scheme, although popular, is not without its teething troubles.At her two-storey brick home on an outcrop overlooking a barren, yet idyllic mountain face, Anita Ghatani, 18, a first-time mother, said she had been forced to borrow from her sisters as the income from homegrown garlic, tomatoes and onions was insufficient to repay her loan.But her struggles did not discourage her from aiming to set up her own agricultural business in the future, she said. The health centre’s advice had also prepared her for the birth of her now cherubic six-month-old son, Anand.Back in Solambu, Renuka Gautam, 40, also had no regrets about joining the programme, even though she was repaying her loan for garden equipment through profits from her small family store.“It’s difficult to access markets as we have no transport,” she said, adding that the women lacked marketing education.Renuka Gautam, 40, at her store in Solambu villageHowever, she said that the scheme had helped crush her embarrassment about women’s health issues. “I now realise the importance of regular cervical screenings. I’m now motivating other women to join us,” she said.Other women, like her neighbour, Lakshmi Lama, 35, have been able to make a quicker profit on livestock rearing.Mrs Lama, four months into her £169 loan for pig and chicken farming said she was thrilled with her new business, which was already generating enough income to reinvest in new livestock and provide for her three children.Dhulikhel officials say the logistical difficulties of vegetable growing have been identified and are being addressed.Laxmi Lama, 35, with her son and daughter at her food store in Solambu villageWhile conclusive data on the programme’s overall success is still being collated, anecdotal evidence suggests that health goals are being reached.A 2015 study on attitudes to cervical cancer screening in rural Nepal, published by the American Association for Cancer Education, and based on 122 women, showed that the proportion willing to undergo a screening shot up from 15.6 per cent to 100 per cent after a community education class.Gita Giri, a midwife at the Solambu centre, who conducts 22 monthly health classes, said she had noticed a marked shift in awareness and women seeking treatment.“Previously women were hesitant to take home pamphlets on sexual health, fearing the reaction of their husbands and in-laws, but they are now much more open,” she said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleAccording to Dr Karmacharya and local leaders, women’s financial independence and new support networks have also substantially reduced domestic violence.“There are women who say they are more confident, that their husbands no longer beat them. It changes the power dynamics,” he said.While healthcare debates often centred on new technology, the design of new delivery systems and approaches was less “glamorous” but fostered real change, argued an impassioned Dr Battacharya.“My firm belief is that the solutions to the problems are best found in the places where the problems lie. The Harvards and Oxfords of global health shouldn’t be in Massachusetts or Cambridge, they should be in places like this,” he said.“I cannot change the world but if I can create a good model of success, then people will learn from that.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Custodians of French language finally cave in to the \u0026#39feminine form\u0026#39Catholic Church cover-up of sex abuse linked to secret gay culture in Vatican, book claims on eve of papal summitGender pay gap is getting worse in nearly half of firms, analysis suggests, as critics say forcing firms to report is not enoughComment: I\u0026#39m a liberal Tory and a member of the ERG.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published the latest findings from its investigation into the deal, which was announced in April last year, on Wednesday.

It’s our responsibility to carry out a thorough assessment of the deal to make sure that the sector remains competitive and shoppers don’t lose out.”Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe criticised the CMA’s analysis and said it was “fundamentally flawed”.“They have fundamentally moved the goalposts, changed the shape of the ball and chosen a different playing field,” he told the BBC. “This is totally outrageous.”A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s and Asda said: “These findings fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market. The CMA has moved the goalposts and its analysis is inconsistent with comparable cases. “Combining Sainsbury’s and Asda would create significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices. Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits. “We are surprised that the CMA would choose to reject the opportunity to put money directly into customers’ pockets, particularly at this time of economic uncertainty. We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks.”Shares in Sainsbury\u0027s dropped 12.5 per cent in early trading.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

By the time they take their GCSEs they are, on average, 19 months behind their peers in attainment.He said: “Screens can be an easy distraction for children, but harnessing the power of technology to support early communication and development means that we have another tool in our arsenal to help young kids develop those skills.”Author Philip Pullman previously said that parents needed to get off their mobile phones and speak to young children to boost their vocabulary.It came after early years experts suggested that children had poorer language skills because parents were too distracted by their digital devices to help them out.We’ll tell you what’s true.

That was an error on our part. The microphone has never been on and is only activated when users specifically enable the option.Security systems often use microphones to provide features that rely on sound sensing. We included the mic on the device so that we can potentially offer additional features to our users in the future, such as the ability to detect broken glass.Google launches extension to find if someone has stolen your passwordThe device is part of what Google calls its Nest alarm system starter pack, providing users with motion sensors and a keypad to create a bespoke home security set-up.Silkie Carlo, director of UK-based privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said the incident would do little to help public trust around smart home devices.It is hard to believe Google cares about people\u0027s privacy after selling a security product with a secret microphone in it, she said.This appears to be deceptive rather than a \u0027mistake\u0027, which is incredibly damaging for public trust in Google. Many of our worries about smart home devices appear to be proving true.This market is normalising the disturbing notion of tech giants constant listening within the privacy of our homes. Google should be held to account for wrongly advertising this product.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could help them track down the location and beginnings of black holes, for instance, and uncover the dramatic ways they eat.If we take a radio telescope and we look up at the sky, we see mainly emission from the immediate environment of massive black holes, said\u0026nbspHuub Röttgering, from Leiden University, in a statement.\u0026nbspWith LOFAR we hope to answer the fascinating question: where do those black holes come from?What we do know is that black holes are pretty messy eaters. When gas falls onto them they emit jets of material that can be seen at radio wavelengths.Nasa launching new mission to find the origins of the universeIt could allow them to track down the mysterious radio emissions that can link clusters of galaxies – which often reach millions of light years across the universe. These strange emissions are thought to come from particles that get accelerated as the galaxies merge.Clusters of galaxies are ensembles of hundreds to thousands of galaxies and it has been known for decades that when two clusters of galaxies merge, they can produce radio emission ning millions of light years. This emission is thought to come from particles that are accelerated during the merger process.With radio observations we can detect radiation from the tenuous medium that exists between galaxies, said Amanda Wilber, from University of Hamburg, in a statement.\u0026nbspThis radiation is generated by energetic shocks and turbulence. LOFAR allows us to detect many more of these sources and understand what is powering them.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure. The next year, in 1995, he won again, for the hugely popular Forrest Gump.Dame Olivia de Havilland, now 102 years old, is perhaps best known for her role in Gone with the Wind. Garnering five nominations across her career, de Havilland took home two statuettes in the 1940s, for To Each His Own and The Heiress.Next to Luise Rainer, Jodie Foster is the only other actor to have won two Oscars before the age of 30, for The Accused in 1988, and Silence of the Lambs in 1991. It’s a fitting record for an actor whose career took off while she was still a child, with breakout roles in Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver.Sir Michael Caine, familiar around the globe for his distinctive cockney accent, once confessed that 1983’s Educating Rita was “the last good picture I made before I mentally retired.” In spite of this, the actor managed to win Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986 and The Cider House Rules in 1999.Cooper won his first Best Actor Oscar in 1942 for Sergeant York. The famously stoic star didn’t turn up to collect his second award – for an understated turn in the classic Western High Noon – instead sending John Wayne, who said: Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He\u0027s one of the nicest fellows I know. I don\u0027t know anybody any nicer.”In 1982, Jessica Lange became the first star in nearly four decades to be nominated for two films in the same year, for Tootsie and Frances, the former of which yielded a win. Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.  Richard Kelly’s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception.Robert Altman’s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler’s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director’s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006.He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner\u0027s 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains.2547 A Matter of Life and Death (1946)The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell \u0026amp Pressburger’s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946.It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film. The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he’d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore).No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn\u0027t getDespite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller’s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 2947 Once Upon a Time in America (1984)Though it\u0027s by no means a masterpiece, it’s staggering to think that Sergio Leone’s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn’t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film\u0027s music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer\u0027s name from the opening credits when trimming the film’s lengthy running time for its American release).Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck.3147 Paths of Glory (1957)Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times. One of his films that didn’t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory.3247 Play Misty for Me (1971)Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy.Univeral PicturesCourtesy of Getty ImagesReservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino’s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker’s debut didn’t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least.Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year’s Oscars, Chloé Zhao’s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair.The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne’s best role, but the Academy didn’t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970.Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director’s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it’s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time.3747 The Shop Around the Corner (1953)It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name.Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda\u0027s portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy.Before he became Disney\u0027s go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival.The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows\u0027 coming-of-drama been in contention for awards.The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell’s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day.Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu\u0027s masterpiece and was named Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s best film of all time in 2012.4347 Touch of Evil (1958)Orson Welles\u0027 classic noir wasn\u0027t as well loved at the time of release as it is today.Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine’s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history.Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations.Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward.Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech\u0027s Tom Hooper for The Social Network. In truth, serial killer drama Zodiac is every bit as good as the Facebook drama.Starring future Oscar-winner Christian Bale,  Mary Harron’s adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel – in which the Vice star plays the psychopathic Patrick Bateman - didn’t receive a single nomination.While the final two chapters of Richard Linklater’s Before… trilogy earned screenplay nominations, the film that introduced the world to future married couple Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) was criminally overlooked.Fritz Lang had a number of films overlooked by the Academy this noir, starring Glenn Ford, Lee Marvin and and Gloria Grahame, was one of them.The Academy’s generosity to the Coen brothers peaked when No Country for Old Men beat There Will Be Blood in one of the ceremony’s closest Best Picture races of all time. It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.  Richard Kelly’s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception.Robert Altman’s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler’s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director’s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006.He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner\u0027s 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains.2547 A Matter of Life and Death (1946)The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell \u0026amp Pressburger’s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946.It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film. The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he’d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore).No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn\u0027t getDespite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller’s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 2947 Once Upon a Time in America (1984)Though it\u0027s by no means a masterpiece, it’s staggering to think that Sergio Leone’s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn’t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film\u0027s music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer\u0027s name from the opening credits when trimming the film’s lengthy running time for its American release).Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck.3147 Paths of Glory (1957)Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times. One of his films that didn’t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory.3247 Play Misty for Me (1971)Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy.Univeral PicturesCourtesy of Getty ImagesReservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino’s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker’s debut didn’t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least.Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year’s Oscars, Chloé Zhao’s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair.The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne’s best role, but the Academy didn’t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970.Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director’s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it’s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time.3747 The Shop Around the Corner (1953)It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name.Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda\u0027s portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy.Before he became Disney\u0027s go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival.The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows\u0027 coming-of-drama been in contention for awards.The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell’s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day.Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu\u0027s masterpiece and was named Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s best film of all time in 2012.4347 Touch of Evil (1958)Orson Welles\u0027 classic noir wasn\u0027t as well loved at the time of release as it is today.Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine’s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history.Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations.Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward.Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech\u0027s Tom Hooper for The Social Network.

It is the planet\u0027s smallest moon, and behaves very strangely, in ways that could shed light on how it first formed.Hippocamp had already been captured in previous images of the nearby planet. But astronomers\u0027 technical abilities were not enough to actually spot it, and only now has the tiny world actually been noticed and catalogued.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhen the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past Neptune in 1989, it spotted six small inner moons orbiting the planet. Each of them is very small, and much younger than Neptune, probably having formed soon after the planet\u0027s largest moon called Triton arrived.But new research shows that there had been another, unnoticed and tiny, moon floating near the planet. That takes the total number of moons around Neptune to 14 and sheds new light on the huge planet.Created with Sketch.Nasa finds flowing water on Mars - in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The breakthrough new discovery used the latest highly technical image processing techniques and images from Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope, allowing astronomers to see the inner moons despite the rapid speed at which they hurtle around Neptune. When the first picture was taken that included Hippocamp in it, in 2004, scientists lacked the ability to spot such a tiny object that was moving so quickly.Nasa launching new mission to find the origins of the universeThe new moon is named Hippocamp, after the sea creature in Greek mythology. Its tiny size makes it the smallest of Neptune\u0027s collection of moons, and it is only about 34 kilometres across.The moon orbits close to Proteus, the biggest and furthest out of those inner moons. Astronomers say it is likely that Hippocamp was formed when fragments came off that bigger object when it was hit by a big comet.They say it can\u0027t be ruled out that Hippocamp was formed where it is now and has no connection to Proteus. But its tiny size and strange location suggests that it formed in a collision, helping shed light on how the rest of the Neptune system formed.Proteus sports an unusually large crater called Pharos — a telltale sign that the moon might have barely escaped destruction by impact, writes astronomer Anne J. Verbiscer in an article commenting on the discovery. Whenever this impact occurred, it no doubt launched debris into orbit around Neptune.One of those splintered pieces of debris could have become the new moon, the authors say.The discovery could also help illuminate how other moons were formed, the authors say. If Hippocamp was formed in such a collision, then it is likely that the others were shaped by impacts with comets.As well as the discovery of Hippocamp, the new research published in Nature also gives new detail on other moons such as Naiad, the innermost moon that has not been seen since 1989. The astronomers also give new data including size and orbit estimates of all the inner moons for the first time.The same technique might lead to even more discoveries. Similar work already helped find an object in the distance reaches of the solar system, and might one day find other moons around larger planets – or even whole planets orbiting distant stars.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published the latest findings from its investigation into the deal, which was announced in April last year, on Wednesday. The watchdog said the proposed deal could lead to a worse experience for in-store and online shoppers across the UK through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, and reductions in the range and quality of products offered.

We also have concerns that prices could rise at a large number of their petrol stations.Mr McIntosh added: “These are our provisional findings, however, and the companies and others now have the opportunity to respond to the analysis we’ve set out today. It’s our responsibility to carry out a thorough assessment of the deal to make sure that the sector remains competitive and shoppers don’t lose out.”Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe criticised the CMA’s analysis and said it was “fundamentally flawed”.“They have fundamentally moved the goalposts, changed the shape of the ball and chosen a different playing field,” he told the BBC. “This is totally outrageous.”A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s and Asda said: “These findings fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market. The CMA has moved the goalposts and its analysis is inconsistent with comparable cases. “Combining Sainsbury’s and Asda would create significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices. Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits. “We are surprised that the CMA would choose to reject the opportunity to put money directly into customers’ pockets, particularly at this time of economic uncertainty. We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks.”Shares in Sainsbury\u0027s dropped 12.5 per cent in early trading.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Several people were killed in the crash on a bridge connecting two islands in Denmark, police saidConditions at the yards have for years attracted international attention, but what is less well known is the pivotal role played by the offshore world.New figures from the NGO Shipbreaking Platform showed that almost half the 532 ships broken on the beaches of south Asia in 2018 flew flags of just three tiny offshore tax havens – the Comoros islands in the Indian Ocean, Palau in the Pacific\u0026nbspand the Caribbean islands of St Kitts and Nevis whose flag was found on 29 of those vessels.Under European state-controlled port inspection regimes, all three flags are blacklisted due to their poor enforcement of international conventions.In the past three years, 143 St Kitts and Nevis vessels have been scrapped on south Asia’s beaches, according to Shipbreaking Platform’s figures.An investigation for The Independent by Finance Uncovered has discovered that all those registrations were arranged by Skanreg, a company described by one industry source as a “bottom feeder … whose stock in trade is registering ships going to scrap”.When we asked Skanreg’s founder and part-owner, Nigel Smith, whether his company should carry any responsibility for sending toxic ships to the beaches, he said: “That is a commercial matter for the parties involved in that transaction.”However, he added that in mid-2018 Skanreg had taken the strategic decision to reduce the number of ships it flagged for scrap, registering 25 for such purposes that year as opposed to 56 in 2017.Responding to the investigation’s findings, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald\u0026nbspsaid they highlighted “the impact of this loophole whereby the ship-breaking industry can flout poorly enforced international regulations to extract maximum profit from shipping assets at the expense of some of the world’s most vulnerable workers, including children”.He added: “It’s imperative that the government address this global market failure.”Mr Smith, a 62-year-old British maritime engineer, founded Skanreg in 2004, and is now semi-retired. The company is currently run by Liam Ryan, a former clerk at Dagenham council who Mr Smith says is currently studying for a diploma in maritime business management from Lloyds Maritime Training Academy as part of his continuing professional development.The company makes its money from charging shipowners and agents a fee for registering their ships with St Kitts and Nevis.Charges are also levied for providing the documentation a vessel needs to leave port.The St Kitts and Nevis government takes a cut of revenue earned by the company but Mr Smith, who represents the islands at the International Maritime Organisation, has been ordered not to disclose the islands’ percentage share.However, he did reveal that the islands had earned around $500,000 (£390,000) from his company in 2016 alone.He owns 50 per cent of Skanreg and, according to accounts at Companies House, was paid £100,000 in idends in 2017.Mr Smith refused to disclose who controls secretive Panamanian corporate entity St Christopher Holdings \u0026amp Investments SA, which owns the other half of the company.Although Mr Smith says only a very small percentage of Skanreg’s revenue comes registering vessels destined for scrap, that part of its business risks casting a shadow over the reputation of the St Kitts and Nevis islands.EU rules have banned ships from being exported from European ports to south Asia since 2006.A new regulation was added in January 2019 so that it is now also illegal for any ship carrying a European flag to be sent to the south Asian beaches.But for ship owners, the financial incentives to send vessels there remain huge. A beaching yard can pay up to $10m (£7.8m) for an oil tanker, whereas shipowners may have to pay for it to be dismantled in a safe, clean facility approved by the EU.To avoid the new flag-based rules, the ship owner can buy the services of Skanreg. The company offers short-term registration, which is popular for “end of life” journeys, for around £5,250.Finance Uncovered discovered Mr Smith’s company after tracing the monies and key players involved in a 2016 scandal in Bangladesh.In that year, the North Sea Producer, a hulking oil platform that had accumulated radioactive material in its hull after 17 years’ work in the North Sea oil fields, was towed from the Tees in Middlesbrough for what would be its final voyage.Three months later, its arrival in Chittagong caused international outrage. Investigative journalists from Danwatch in Denmark had been tracking its movements and filed explosive reports to TV audiences.At the same time, environmental lawyers in Bangladesh secured an injunction to prevent its scrapping as tests showed illegal levels of radioactivity.Investigations, including one by the UK Environment Agency, into how it was allowed to travel from Britain to Bangladesh are ongoing.While operating in the North Sea, it had been part-owned by Danish shipping giant Maersk, which had leased it to US oil major ConocoPhillips.Before leaving port, the Maersk-linked company sold it to Conquistador Shipping Corporation, a company registered in Nevis.At some point it was renamed “Producer” and re-flagged from the Isle of Man to St Kitts and Nevis.According to emails obtained by Finance Uncovered under freedom of information laws, it was Skanreg which arranged for the provision of certificates for the ship to leave port in Middlesbrough.Mr Smith said his company was told the ship was “to be taken down to West Africa” for ongoing use and that the journey to Bangladesh was not authorised by Skanreg.However, the documents also show that the agents for Conquistador were GMS, the world’s leading shipbreaking company – and that Conquistador was set to receive $6.6m (£5.1m) from the Chittagong yard.The company is cooperating with the Environment Agency and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Skanreg.The Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) challenged the legality of the import by what they call an “untraceable” offshore company in the Bangladesh courts, and have argued that the government must regulate the import of ships from blacklisted flags like those operated by Skanreg.BELA’s injunction is ongoing and GMS said it was involved in the “safe and responsible recycling of ships.”According to Ingvild Jennsen, director of Shipbreaking Platform, “poor implementation and enforcement by St Kitts is what makes this flag particularly attractive at end-of-life because the shipowners…will take advantage of the lack of rigorous compliance checks by its registry”.She added that\u0026nbspSkanreg provides a marketplace for regulation. “Until private ship registries like Skanreg stop making a business out of jurisdictional loopholes, meaningful regulation of this toxic trade will be hard to come by,” she said.However, Mr Smith said ship “recycling” was a “legitimate and necessary part of the shipping industry” – and a trade that boosted the economies of countries such as Bangladesh.He strongly denied his company was either a specialist or a facilitator in the scrapping sector, pointing out that in 2018, Panama, Comoros and Palau all flagged many more scrap ships than St Kitts and Nevis.He added that ship breaking was an inherently dangerous business, as was merchant shipping generally.“Ships have accidents and sinkings resulting in injury and sometimes deaths,” he said. “No one is asking for shipping to stop.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspHe also said that the St Kitts and Nevis government was a supporter of the Hong Kong Convention, an agreement drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation, the UN’s body for shipping. The convention, which is not yet in force, includes guidelines on ship recycling but it has been criticised by campaigners because it would allow the “beaching method”.Labour’s Mr McDonald said: “This is a reminder of the ongoing problem which is flag states being allowed to sell their maritime register to disreputable operators.“I’m concerned that some shipowners disregard the responsible ship recycling option by selling off these assets for a final lump sum to dubious intermediaries, very often UK-based, who then use tax havens to sidestep regional regulators who often don’t have the capacity or political will themselves to properly enforce the law.“Many shipping companies do the right thing and recycle their vessels in safe and regulated facilities, and they must be supported too but the worst practices must be tackled first.”Margot Gibbs is a reporter at Finance Uncovered, a London based non-profit which trains and works with journalists on illicit finance investigationsWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Further votes may take place the following day.However many, including Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, believe Ms May\u0026nbspis planning to delay the meaningul vote until after the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 March, even if an extension to the Article 50 deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspis offered.Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is in those final days that we have the biggest chance to convince MPs to give this decision back to the public.”What will the march be demanding?The key demand is that\u0026nbspany Brexit deal should be put to a public vote for final approval.“Instead of letting Theresa May kick the can down the road until the March 29 deadline, hundreds of thousands of people will march on parliament offering a solution to a crisis that threatens our rights, our living standards and our environment,” said former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.One proposal for avoiding a no-deal Brexit and securing a second referendum involves tabling\u0026nbspan amendment\u0026nbspin the last week before 29 March.MPs would then approve her deal only if it was subject to a public vote.Where\u0026nbspwill the march take place?The march is set to begin at 12pm, or “high noon”, on Saturday 23 March, on London’s Park Lane.Organisers from the People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbsphave not yet released full details of the route but the march is due to end at Parliament Square with a “mass rally and keynote speeches”.Who will be joining the march?Several leading politicians\u0026nbspincluding Caroline Lucas,\u0026nbspDavid Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Conservative MP Anna Soubry, and the leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, have already confirmed their support.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspis supporting the march and encouraging readers to attend.The organisers are hoping to widen their appeal beyond those who have previously supported the People’s Vote and Final Say campaigns.\u0026nbspThe Independent‘s petition calling on the prime minister to give the people a final say on Brexit has attracted well over 1.1 million sigantures.“The only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a People’s Vote,” said Sir Vince.For more details about the Put It To The People march\u0026nbsp– and to sign up – please visit\u0026nbsppeoples-vote.ukmarchFor updates on what’s going on with Brexit, you can register here to receive our new Brexit in Brief newsletter and other benefits.

We have let you down.We know it, we are trying to do better, we are trying to become the party we have always aspired to be.We will not stop working until we once again become a safe and welcome home for people from the Jewish community, as from every other.He continued: I joined the Labour Party because I believed it was simply the best vehicle for progressive social change in this country. I still do.But no party has a monopoly on virtue and in the Labour Party we are learning a bitter lesson.Speaking in the Commons during a debate on antisemitism, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner - who is usually very loyal to the party leadership - says he has made a formal complaint about Labour\u0027s decision to readmit former Militant member\u0026nbspDerek Hatton. He says that, after hearing of the decision:I wrote to the general secretary of our party, I lodged a formal complaint. I understand that action has since been taken in respect of the complaint.I think it was a travesty...For the news of his readmission to come\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsppublic attention on the very day when some members of our party were forced out, I think was appalling.Theresa May will attend an EU-Arab League summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Egpyt, on Sunday, Downing Street has confirmed.\u0026nbspThe president of the European Commission has poured cold water on the possibility of a breakthrough in\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbsptalks ahead of a meeting with\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspin Brussels.The prime minister is travelling to the EU capital on Wednesday night to meet Jean-Claude Juncker and try to convince the bloc to change the agreement to make it more palatable to Tory MPs.\u0026nbspLabour going on the attack over Anna Soubry\u0027s coalition comments.

There has been a dismal failure to stand up to the hard line ERG which operates openly as a party within a party, with its own leader, whip and policy.The prime minister will meet Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, ahead of another Commons vote on Brexit next week.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is not the forthright position many campaigners hoped to be in at this stage in the Brexit process.It is now not even clear if this more caveated approach to winning a new referendum, or\u0026nbspa more direct one, will be put in front of MPs for a vote on 27 February – which is being hailed as “high noon” for the country’s approach to Brexit in other respects.Last October when 700,000 people poured out on to the streets demanding a new referendum, the feeling was that momentum was swinging in their direction, that Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspwould ultimately have no choice but to back one and that, if it came to a vote in the Commons at the right time, MPs would push it through.Since then\u0026nbspall sides have become stuck in the bog of Brexit’s political complexity. Those wanting a Final Say will hope that the split in Labour’s ranks does not distract\u0026nbspfrom that overriding aim, but rather focusses minds on a second referendum.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We will have friendly talk tomorrow but I don’t expect a breakthrough,” Mr Juncker said ahead of the talks.Asked about the visit a spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday: “Each time that the prime minister expresses her wish to come we will always be happy to listen to her and see what she has to say.”Jeremy Hunt says EU shares responsibility to prevent no-deal BrexitHe confirmed the leaders were not planning to hold a press conference or take questions during the trip.Previous visits from the prime minister have also broken up without significant progress. Theresa May’s ministers Stephen Barclay and Geoffrey Cox also visited on Monday and are expected to return this week.Speaking in Berlin ahead of the meeting Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, said the EU would share responsibility for a damaging failure if there was a no-deal.He insisted that the UK government could get its Brexit deal through parliament despite a string of defeats – but only if there were legally binding changes to the backstop.Mr Hunt said “the only way through the current situation” was for the EU to agree a change to the Irish backstop.The Foreign Secretary added: “At this momentous time, a heavy responsibility falls upon all of us.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“We do not want historians in the future to puzzle over our actions and ask themselves how it was that Europe failed to achieve an amicable change in its relationship with Britain – a country that is not simply a partner but a friend and ally in every possible sense.”He said a failure to have reached a deal would mean the parties had “thereby afflicted grave and avoidable damage to our continent”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

They will also be joined by former Labour MP Joan Ryan, who resigned from Jeremy Corbyn’s party on Tuesday night, meaning the new group now has 11 MPs.Speaking at a press conference in Westminster, Ms Soubry said she had made the decision to resign after concluding\u0026nbspthat the “right-wing shift” in the Conservative Party was not reversible.Tories quit party over Brexit to join ex-Labour MPs in new group“The right wing, the\u0026nbsphardline anti-EU awkward squad that have destroyed every leader for the last 40 years are now running the Conservative Party from top to tail – they are the Conservative Party.”Urging other Tory MPs ​and like-minded Lib Dems to come and join us, she continued: “Dear friends and now former colleagues who share those one-nation values and principles will of course today deny it, but I believe in their heads and in their hearts they know it’s over.“And the reason they know it’s over is because we lost the referendum and Brexit now defines and shapes the Conservative Party.”“But in that spirit, the first people that she invited into No10\u0026nbspwere the ERG – the very people who just weeks beforehand had called a vote of no confidence in her leadership and had delighted in calling out her failures to any passing microphone.”In contrast, Ms Soubry\u0026nbspsaid,\u0026nbsp”mainstream Conservatives with a fine record of loyalty who have\u0026nbspserved at the highest level in government...are\u0026nbspstill waiting for a call”.Created with Sketch.Rebel MPs defect from parties to join the Independent Group Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Details on the inidual MPs are in the following photosThe prominent anti-Brexit MP for Broxtowe resigned from the Conservative party on February 20 Anti-Brexit MP for South Cambridgeshire resigned from the Conservative party on February 20MP for Liverpool Wavertree since 2010, resigned from the Labour Party over bullying and anti-semitism MP for Streatham since 2010 and prominent People\u0027s Vote supporterAnti-Brexit MP for Totnes resigned from the Conservative party on February 20 MP for Enfield North resigned from the Labour party on February 19 citing its tolerance of a culture of anti-Jewish racismMP for Stockport since 1992MP for Luton South since 2010MP for Nottingham East since 2010MP for Ilford South since 1992MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge since 2010Details on the inidual MPs are in the following photosThe prominent anti-Brexit MP for Broxtowe resigned from the Conservative party on February 20 Anti-Brexit MP for South Cambridgeshire resigned from the Conservative party on February 20MP for Liverpool Wavertree since 2010, resigned from the Labour Party over bullying and anti-semitism MP for Streatham since 2010 and prominent People\u0027s Vote supporterAnti-Brexit MP for Totnes resigned from the Conservative party on February 20 MP for Enfield North resigned from the Labour party on February 19 citing its tolerance of a culture of anti-Jewish racismMP for Stockport since 1992MP for Luton South since 2010MP for Nottingham East since 2010MP for Ilford South since 1992MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge since 2010Ms Allen also hit out at Ms May\u0027s leadership of the Conservatives, saying serving as a Tory MP had left her\u0026nbsptired of feeling numb.Criticising the government\u0027s welfare policies, the South Cambridgeshire MP\u0026nbspsaid: I believed I was part of a party who\u0026nbspworked collaboratively, welcomed knowledge and had the empathy to feel, but I have slowly but surely\u0026nbsprealised that I am not.I can no longer represent a government and a party\u0026nbspwho can\u0027t open their eyes to the suffering endured\u0026nbspby the most vulnerable in society - suffering that we have deepened\u0026nbspwhile having the power to fix.She said Ms May had been bullied into submission by the ERG and was dragging the country kicking and screaming to the edge of a no-deal abyss.Ms Allen also claimed that a\u0026nbspsignificant number of MPs were considering quitting their parties to join the Independent Group.She said: Having the courage to do what you know is right is hard but are there a number of colleagues in all parties who are keen to join us? Absolutely, but everybody\u0026nbsphas to get there in their own time.Ms Wollaston, who chairs the Commons health committee, said Theresa May simply hasn\u0027t delivered on the pledge she made on the steps of Downing Street to tackle the burning injustices in our society.She added: I think that what we now see is the party\u0026nbspthat was once the most trusted on the economy and business\u0026nbspis now marching us to the cliff-edge of a no-deal Brexit.Announcing their resignation in a letter to Ms May, the three MPs wrote: “Sadly the Conservative Party has increasingly abandoned these principles with a shift to the right of British politics.“We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and the DUP.”They said that the “final straw” was what they claimed had been the government’s “disastrous” handling of Brexit with “red lines” that alienated almost half of the population.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The rationale for extremists joining mainstream parties is logical:\u0026nbspfrom within them, they can influence policy\u0026nbspfrom without, they very rarely can.“The Conservative Party membership appears to be ‘hollowing out’\u0026nbsptraditional Conservatives, while former Ukip members strengthen the anti-European right of the party.”In a blistering attack on Jacob Rees-Mogg‘s ERG, he continued: “In parliament, the European Research Group has become a party within a party, with its own whips, its own funding and its own priorities.\u0026nbspSome of its more extreme members have little or no affinity to moderate, pragmatic and tolerant Conservatism.“The ERG does not represent a majority view,\u0026nbspbut with a minority government – as now – can determine policy simply by being intransigent, which is precisely what it is doing.“Some – who can fairly be called zealots – seem incapable of looking beyond the one issue of Europe.\u0026nbspIt’s not just that it dominates their thinking – it seems to obsess them.”Sir John was speaking after seven\u0026nbspMPs resigned from the Labour Party\u0026nbspto form a new parliamentary grouping.

Even if such a party were elected, what would unfold when it fell out of favour?\u0026nbspFor all governments are mortal.“With mainstream opinion sidelined, the country’s only choice would be between the extremes of left or right.

The money came from 220,000 small donors, with Mr Sanders – as in 2016 – refusing money from corporate sources.By contrast, the campaign of Kamala Harris raised $1.5m within the first 24 hours of her announcing she was running on January 21. It also broke Mr Sanders’ own efforts from 2016, when he gathered\u0026nbsp $1.5m in online donations on the first day of his bid to secure the Democratic nomination.“The only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that work for all is with a grassroots movement – the likes of which has never been seen in American history,” Mr Sanders said of the donations.“They may have the money and power.

He he were to be elected president, the senator would be 79 when he assumed office, and 86 when he left, if he served two terms.\u0026nbspBy contrast, Donald Trump – the man Mr Sanders is seeking to beat – is 72, while Joe Biden, the other septuagenarian among the top of polls for potential Democratic challengers, is 76.

Time to offer them up.Brexiteers must then hold their noses and vote for Theresa May’s deal. All other roads lead to catastrophe.They won’t get the backstop removed. We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell. We marvel that so many can still stomach these sinister men poised to do unimaginable harm.But eventhey can’t grasp that, Tory Brexiteers can. And we say this to them:Wake up. Look how close you now are to bringing this calamity about.WILL the Government squander the biggest potential shale gas discovery in our history It is believed there is enough under the East Midlands alone to power Britain cheaply for  years.Yet the Tories are suffocating this new industry at birth by persisting with an absurdly low limit on the level of tremor allowable when drilling.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood. But he did get a pat on the head for his impossible save from Pele in .My favourite Banks save was the one he made when a dog ran on the pitch at Leicester in .The dog is moving at some speed. But Banks collects him with his left hand under the mutt’s chest and his right hand on the dog’s butt – a perfect catch.Rest in peace, Gordon. Always England’s No.LABOUR’S John McDonnell, who has spent his political career licking the boots of the IRA, describes Winston Churchill as a “villain”.Not the same Churchill who inspired this country when we stood alone against Nazi Germany’s subjugation of Europe  Yes, that’s the chap.IRA groupie McDonnell reckons the greatest Englishman in history was a villain because Winnie sent troops to Wales during a miners’ strike in .History tells us that Churchill was reluctant to involve troops in a miners’ strike.But why bother with the facts The likes of John McDonnell despise this country, our heroes, our history and believe the British are always the wicked ones.Even when fighting for our lives against Hitler!GAVIN “Mad Dog” Williamson, our gung-ho Defence Secretary, says excitedly that the RAF will get “swarm squadrons” of drones to confuse enemy defences.Mad Dog is full of ideas about how the UK is ready to use “hard power” against Russia and China.Williamson’s moronic sabre-rattling disturbs real soldiers.“We don’t want a war in the South China Sea,” says Admiral Lord West of Spithead, a former head of the Royal Navy, who counsels against “talking wildly and loosely” about fighting China.Now Williamson’s macho posturing is causing our country harm.China’s Deputy Prime Minister, Hu Chunhua, was due to hold trade talks with Chancellor Philip Hammond but cancelled the meeting because our Mad Dog Defence Secretary had been ranting about China’s military ambitions.The UK does not want to fight a war with China and Russia, Mad Dog. We want to TRADE with them.Memo to Mrs May – your Defence Secretary is a national embarrassment.“I have a little wine with meals, and a Guinness or a beer or two, but otherwise no. Mind you,I meet you in a bar and you say, ‘Do you want a drink ’, I wouldn’t turn you down.This must seem like a squeaky-clean existence to Keith.The rest of us would call it “still drinking”.CONGRATULATIONS to Myleene Klass, fabulously pregnant at  and looking forward to giving a baby sibling to her daughters Ava, , and Hero, seven.Myleene has had her ups and downs – but then haven’t we all These include a failed first marriage and a period when wine o’clock was starting before noon.Now she has found real and lasting happiness with PR Simon Motson.We all remember Myleene showering under that waterfall in the jungle but what she doesn’t get enough credit for is becoming the best DJ on radio.With her work on Smooth and Classic FM, nobody plays such a wide range of banging tunes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, the door should be left open for hershe shows heartfelt contrition and agrees to speak out on behalf of our nation against radicalisation.She has to be investigated for any criminal actions she has undertaken. If there is enough evidence, prosecute her. If we are unable to charge her, she must be put under Terrorist Prevention and Investigation Measures, . This means controlling her movement, access to the Internet and to whom she comes into contact with. This needs to be done for the safety of our citizens until we can change her, and then again, assuming we can change her.Ultimately, Shamima has to realise that coming back to our country means that she has to payback to our country and that she is in effect, become a poster girl for why Islamist extremist states are so toxic to the lives of iniduals Shamima has to earn back her space in our society.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I kept seeing this same man’s name coming up.“The messages he received said ‘hello are you there ’, ‘stop f***ing ignoring me’, then he said ‘I will find you’, ‘where are you ’ He was sending these messages to a ten-year-old. Denver was terried.“The person had a picture. I didn’t report it to police because I deleted the app, I wish I had told the police but I was keen to just get rid of it.“I went on to my son’s phone to look at what had been sent and I looked at the content.“He’s only ten…there must be a way for them to get parents’ permission to get on it. But there’s no way of them verying their age.“I had to tell him that not everyone in the world is nice and people do use these sites to send horrible messages and threaten people and stuff.Mr Morales revealed he has now deleted the app and his sons school held an assembly on the dangers of social media after he alerted them.Gran Michaela Clark, , from Derbyshire, was shocked when she learned her granddaughter Grace, ten, had been groomed on the site.She told the Sun Online: “My granddaughter had been on the site for three days and then my daughter Jemma got a visit from the police askingGrace was alright.“The police had gone round because a guy from Canada, a paedophile hunter, had been watching this group and he’d said that Grace had been groomed on TikTok.She’d been entering private chats with someone who’d claimed to have known her.“He threatened to come to her house and take hershe didn’t do certain things.“It just makes you want to scream out to people. What appears to be an innocent site where she’s making music videos and sending them to her friends is a site with nasty people on.“Her phone is now with the police and they are examining it.“Grace’s mum Jemma was horried. It’s really, really sad. It needs highlighting to everyone out there.”Another parent, who didnt want to be named, warned: “I was horried to have my -year-old daughter show me a video she came across of a man masturbating under a dancing hashtag she searched. It’s absolutely horrying.”The app is currently the one of the most popular in the world, ranked as th in the Apple charts - above Spoty, Netflix, and Snapchat.TikTok is now available in  languages and was downloaded more than  million times on Apples App store during the full first half of .Despite this, experts have warned of its danger with John Carr, one of the UK’s leading experts on child online safety, saying: “There’s no question an app like this is a magnet for paedophiles.”The French vlogger Le Roi des Rats said predators “do not hide at all”.He said: “When a young girl dances in skimpy clothes or imitates sexy dances, you’re sure to find people in the comments either asking them to continue making these kinds of videos, saying they’re sexy or asking for their Snapchat or DM [to direct message]. Some of these girls are not even ten years old.”TikTok lets users create and share short videos with music and camera effects.It is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, founded by the entrepreneur Zhang Yiming.The  billion conglomerate acquired the Musical.ly app in  and merged it with TikTok, bringing millions of new users.It is the world’s most downloaded iPhone app – with nearly  million downloads across the globe, according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower.Facebook has taken notice of TikToks rising popularity, and launched a competitor app called Lasso in November last year.Charities have also warned about the dangers of the app.Barnardo’s issued a warning saying kids had been encouraged to engage in sexual activity online by predators in the comments section of the app.A spokesman told the Sun Online: “The popularity of live streaming services like TikTok and Live.ly is contributing to younger and younger children needing to access specialist help after being exploited online.“During   Barnardo’s child sexual exploitation services supported  children aged eight who had been exploited, were at risk of being exploited, or siblings of children who had been exploited.”Andy Burrows, NSPCC’s Associate Head of Child Safety Online, told the Sun Online: “We know that a disturbing amount of children are being contacted via livestreaming apps by abusers using them as a hunting ground.“It’s alarming how little progress has been made by social networks to combat this.“Shockingly, a quarter of , children in our research had livestreamed with someone they have never met, and one in  children had been asked to take their clothes off.“That’s why we are calling for social networks to be legally forced to make children’s accounts safe, and over nine out of ten parents agree.“Sites that fail should face hefty fineswe are to tame the Wild West Web once and for all.”The warnings came in the wake of an investigation that revealed  cases of child rape had been investigated by police since  after victims evaded age checks on dating apps.A Freedom of Information request also showed  further instances of child sex offences – including grooming, kidnapping and violent assault – through online dating services.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright described the findings as “truly shocking.”Responding to the findings TikTok told the Sun Online safety on the app was their top priority but said it was becoming an increasingly challenging situation.They admitted they couldnt stop users lying about their age but had given TikTok a + App Store rating so parents can block it from their child’s phone using device-based parental controls.They have also introduced a number of features to give our users more control over their accounts and content, including a digital well-being .Please see the Apple App Store or Google Play Store instructions for more on parental controls and how to enable them.How can my teen control who sees their videos and sends them messages Users can control who can see their uploaded content, follow them, and send them messages by making their account private. With a private account, users can approve or deny followers and restrict their uploaded content and incoming messages to followers only.If a user has a public profile, anyone signed into the TikTok app can view that user’s public videos. However, only approved followers can send that user a message.Whether users choose to have a public or a private account, they can always:Even with a private account, profile information – including profile photo, username, and bio – will be visible to all users. How can my teen report inappropriate content or behavior If you or your teen sees something that might violate the apps Terms of Service, it can be reported to TikTok’s moderation team.Users can report a specic video, user or comment within the app itself.Furthermore, your teen can block another user from being able to view their content or send them messages.A spokesperson said: Promoting a safe and positive app experience is our top priority and we have a number of protective measures in place to protect against misuse.Unfortunately, these protections aren’t always perfect, as seen in these examples.However, we are committed to improving and enhancing our protective measures, and we use learnings like these to continually hone our moderation efforts and filters.As always, we also encourage users to report any inappropriate content or usage through our in-app reporting options in order to help us maintain an appropriate and positive app environment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000457256457.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour say jihadist teen shamima begum should be allowed back into britain","story":"One of the partys law bosses insisted the -year-old is entitled toto this country.And Diane Abbott has spoken out against removing her British passport in order to keep her out of the UK.Labours intervention comes as ministers work out a way to keep Begum out amid fears she could present a serious threat.Sajid Javid blasted in the Commons: If you back terror, there must be consequences.He is understood to be considering revoking her British citizenship on the grounds that she is eligible to be a citizen of Bangladesh.But Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Shadow Solicitor General, suggested Begum should be allowed back in.He said: Can the Home Secretary confirm first that UK citizens are entitled toto this country under international law, but should be held to account upon their  Under international law, the Government cannot make people stateless.He added that Brits whove fought for ISIS should expect to face justice in legal processtheyto Britain.Shadow Home Secretary Ms Abbott said in a statement: “We are not in favour of making people stateless, that’s a punishment without due process.If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that anyone who is entitled toto this country either committed or facilitated acts of terrorism, they should be fully investigated and where appropriate prosecuted.Today Begum, who gave birth over the weekend, said the Manchester Arena bombing was justied retaliation for the bombing of ISIS bases.She says she wants toto Britain so her infant son can be cared for on the NHS."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT0004699955541.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"independents cant reverse brexit democracy","story":"But there is a fatal flaw in the Remainers’ pitch to the nation.You cannot “build a new politics” when your foundation stone is an attempt to reverse the biggest democratic mandate in our history.That is not a respectable position.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000447080221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british kids fattest europe asthma","story":"They also have the highest death rate from asthma, an international study has found.And when it comes to exercise, only Portugal has more young couch potatoes.The analysis by the Nuffield Trust and the Association for Young People’s Health found that the UK’s under-s are getting unhealthier despite more of them not taking up cigarettes and booze.One in five has a chronic health condition such as diabetes.And . per cent of  to -year-olds are obese.Louise Meincke at the World Cancer Research Fund said: “Children who are obese are more likely to be obese as adults, and this increases their risk of  cancers and other conditions.”Nuffield Trust chief exec Nigel Edwards said: “Young people are holding up their side of the bargain, with more of them choosing to smoke and drink less, yet our health system seems to be getting something badly wrong.”But Jacqueline Cornish from NHS England said: “The NHS Long Term Plan delivers a new, dedicated programme for young people’s health.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

IS.Tellingly, Shamima says he treated her “really well”, that she still loves him, and “I wouldn’t have found someone like him back in the UK.”In other words, in her deluded young head, a convicted terrorist was quite a catch.But fast-forward to now, and by her own admission, -year-old Shamima is “not the same silly little -year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago.”She says that the whole experience — including losing her first two children and seeing a decapitated head in a bin — has “made me tougher, stronger”.And as we know from her unrepentant interviews, she feels she has done nothing wrong, displays a breathtaking sense of entitlement when demanding our sympathy, and, most heinously of all, feels that the Manchester terror attack was “fair justication” for the women and children killed in the Islamic State.So, as the “tougher, stronger” adult she now is, she must be treated as such and left where she is.Revoking her British citizenship, as Home

is wilfully displaying terrorist sympathies, has lost two children already — one to malnutrition — and is currently living in squalor.AndShamima is as concerned about her baby son’s wellbeing as she claims she is, then she should willingly hand him over to either the UK or Dutch authorities for fostering with a family where love, rather than hate, is the norm.MODEL Abbey Clancy says she wanted to

Anna Soubry claimed billions in cruel welfare cuts were absolutely necessary and the government had done a marvellous job. The former Business Minister made her shock comments in a press conference where she was one of the Tory Three Amigos quitting for the new Independent Group. The group now has  members including  from Labour - yet Ms Soubrys comments show they are already split on massive issues. Speaking minutes earlier, ex-Tory Heidi Allen said Tory policies had deepened the suffering endured by the most vulnerable in society and she could no longer represent them. But askedshe regretted welfare changes and austerity, Ms Soubry said: I believe we did the right thing in the Coalition government in particular.   I think the Coalition government which I served in did a marvellous job. She said David Cameron “made many mistakes” - and acknowledged some councils were now struggling as a result of cuts. But she added: I have to say I think the things we did to the economy were absolutely necessary at the time.  I don’t have a problem with that. A Labour source said: It didnt take long for the Independent Group to show their hand and reveal they stand for privatisation, austerity and tax cuts for the rich. It came as Theresa May was hit with a bombshell Tory split as three of her most high-profile anti-Brexit MPs quit the party.   Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston and Anna Soubry dramatically crossed the floor of the House of Commons today and sat on the opposition benches as they joined the Independent Group. In a devastating joint resignation letter to Theresa May , the trio said she is now in the grip of hard Brexit Tories and the final straw has been this governments disastrous handling of Brexit. And in a savage press conference, Ms Allen said Mrs May had been bullied into submission by hard Brexiteers dragging the country kicking and screaming into the abyss.  She added bluntly: Im done. And Ms Soubry said: I’m not leaving the Conservative Party - it’s left us. Heidi Allen joked: You’ve met the Magnicent Seven, you’ve probably heard last night about the lone ranger, so I guess that makes us the three amigos. It is a crushing blow to the Prime Minister just moments before Prime Ministers Questions - and hours before she s to Brussels in a bid to get a deal  days before we leave. Mrs May responded by saying she was saddened and thanking the MPs for their service. Speaking after Ms Soubrys comments, fellow Independent Group MP Chris Leslie admitted: Being the Independent Group we are definitely going to continue to have independent free thinking iniduals who will not always agree on every issue. If youre searching for disagreements you will be able to find them, but I actually think that is the reality of mainstream Britain. Heidi Allen said MPs would not be sent to abrainwashing conference to make sure they agree. Chris Leslie insisted that unlike claims by Labour I am anti-austerity and I am not in favour of privatisation.

In a savage press conference, Ms Allen said Mrs May had been bullied into submission by hard Brexiteers dragging the country kicking and screaming into the abyss. She added bluntly: Im done. Ms Allen said she had no political interest until the  riots, when watching the news night after night it was asLord Kitchener was pointing his finger out of the screen to me. ‘Your country needs you’. She thought David Cameron was the answer, she said, but found myself going over the top fighting for benevolence in our welfare system. Slamming Tory MPs who sit idly by nodding through policy and voting like sheep, she said: I am tired of feeling numb. She added: I feel excited. So excited in a way I havent felt since I was first elected - and a sense of liberation. Yet she refused calls to resign and test her new mandate in a by-election - saying the big parties could use it as a chance to crush the birth of democracy.   Heidi Allens speech in full: So nice so many friends in the room. So youve met the magnicent seven, you probably heard last night about the lone ranger, so I guess that makes us the Three Amigos. My name is Heidi Allen and Im very very proud to be the Member for Parliament for South Cambridgeshire. I love my constituency, it is bursting with innovation and a desire to challenge the status quo. I love that my constituents want to share their talents and their discoveries to make the world a better place and to tackle inequalities. My constituents make my head and my heard fizz with possibilities. I want to feel that way in Westminster too. I am tired of feeling numb. . So today, alongside my wonderful colleagues, I have resigned from the Conservative Party. It was the Tottenham riots in  that stimulated my change in career. I was busy running my own manufacturing business, I had no political interest whatsoever and Id never even thought about joining a political party. But watching the news night after night it was asLord Kitchener was pointing his finger out of the screen at me: Your Country Needs You! That raw hunger to serve my country and to offer my skills and experience led me to the Conservative Party. I believe that under David Cameron and his Big Society the party, like me, was ambitious for the country.   It was challenging the Nasty Party image and proving that we could, in fact, be a party of both competence and compassion. So why so often, too often, in the last three years have I found myself going over the top fighting for benevolence in our welfare system. The Department for Work and Pensions has had six secretaries of state in three years - six. You wouldnt run a business like that and expect it to succeed so how can it possibly be acceptable when you are completely redesigning our welfare safety net, particularly when that net is so vital when we are at our lowest and when we need it most because those that rely on the net are people and not numbers. I shouldnt have to feel that the only option left open to me is to take a camera crew around the country to shine a devastating spotlight on poverty. It shouldnt be this hard. I believed I was part of a party who worked collaboratively, welcomed knowledge and had the empathy to feel. But I have slowly but surely realised that I am not. I can no longer represent a government and a party who cant open their eyes to the suffering endured by the most vulnerable in society. Suffering which we have deepened whilst having the power to fix. The Conservatives were always recognised as the party of economic competence but when we allowed a cabinet minister to say eff business and we have a Prime Minister bullied into submission by the ERG and is now dragging the country and parliament kicking and screaming to the edge of a no deal abyss. Im done. I want to be part of something better.  A party th at people vote for because they want to - not because they feel they have to. But this afternoon I feel a mix of emotions: apprehension, some sadness, I do worry about my relationship with good friends Ive made with the Conservative Party they know who they are. But do you know what I also feel ladies and gentleman, I feel excited, so excited - and in a way that I havent felt since I was first elected, a sense of liberation, because the United Kingdom deserves better. I didnt leave my business to lower my professional standards and accept second best. I demand more for my party and more for my country, competence, more collaboration, more expert analysis, more transparency, more care and more fairness. It needs to push, and shove, and drive - not cower from its own shadow.   It should attract the best minds, the biggest hearts and the most effective communicators. I, we, are prepared to dare to dream that this could be possible. But its not going to happenwe sit idly by nodding through policy and voting like sheep.If Brexit was a pained clarion call for change, then we hear it.Our parties have been able to grasp the magnitude of the challenge and have no plan to respond, nor heal the isions across our cities, our villages, and our dining tables. So we need to start again with a clean sheet. And as true centre ground MPs sharing the same values as millions of our citizens. We have a responsibility to act.This week is the beginning. Once there were seven and now there are seven - and at the last count around , Twitter followers.So yes we are putting our heads above the parapet and we might fail. But isnt the prize worth fighting for. And I sense the country wants us to fight for it too. And I for one am prepared to give it everything Ive got.

It suggests Jeremy Corbyn will not be able to rely on the  MPs, including  ex-Tories, to help unseat the governmenthe forces another no confidence vote. If enough Tories came on board, it is possible the group could team up with other opposition parties and force Theresa May from office.But today Heidi Allen, one of three MPs who quit the Tories for the group, admitted the new group are not ready to face an election and it would crush us.  And askedthe new group would back a no confidence vote Mr Leslie said: We dont believe right now, at this moment of national crisis, a general election would be the right thing for the country. Next week weve got probably the most important set of Brexit votes. He said February  could turn into an all-night sitting of the Commons on whether to delay Brexit, and from our point of view, that has to be the priority. Mr Leslie even predicted Jeremy Corbyn might push for a repeat of the no confidence vote he tried - and failed - to pass in January. He told journalists: Clearly you can imagine circumstances, because its changing the numbers in terms of the government, that there might be some game playing by Jeremy Corbyn in terms of no confidence motions and all those things. Were quite alive to the fact that the Labour leadership are very much in the game playing mode. And I am in my own point of view not up for playing silly games any longer.   He added: Therefore I am certainly not pre-disposed to having an election at this time. Heidi Allen, who quit the Tories to join the group, added: Its not all about us. Its about what is best for the country. And a general election election would be THE worst thing, now at minus  hours or something until Brexit. That would be the last thing we need. She added: Given whats happened in both parties this week, I think both parties would be utterly foolish to try and push the nuclear button in a general election. I dont think theyll be looking for it either. It came despite Ms Allen telling journalists she wanted the new movement to destroy the Tory party. Askedshe wouldto her old party she replied: I cant imagine it. I just cant. Not least becausewe do our jobs right, there wont be a Tory party to go back to.

Staff were locked out from accessing data as a furious warning was issued to MPs by general secretary Jennie Formby. A Labour source confirmed data was accessed by one of the MPs in the Independent Group, though did not say who. The Independent Group did not immediatelya request for comment. The incident gives a flavour of the furious factional battles that can be expectedTIG candidates stand against Labour. Ms Formby sent a message to the Parliamentary Labour Party threatening action by the Information Commissioner watchdog. In the message sent to the Mirror she wrote: The Party’s elected representatives, at all levels, have a proud record of conscientiously observing their obligations in relation to personal data. In recent days, however, the Party has become aware of a number of attempts to access personal data held on the Party’s systems by iniduals who are not, or are no longer, authorised to do so.   We are aware that the Information Commissioner is taking an increasingly serious view of misuse of personal data. Anyone accessing, using or otherwise processing data without authority or for an unauthorised purpose is at risk of action by the Commissioner’s Office, whose powers have increased substantially since the  Act became law. The partys Organise site which hosts data collected on the electorates voting intention alongside Labour membership details was understood to have become unavailable on Wednesday afternoon. Left-wing activist Owen Jones said: Within two days of being founded, a nascent party which says politics is broken has potentially broken the law for political advantage   A Labour Party spokesman confirmed: We have become aware of attempts to access personal data held on the Party’s systems by iniduals who are not authorised to do so. Personal data the Party holds about iniduals is protected by law, under the GDPR and Data Protection Act . We are aware that the Information Commissioner is taking an increasingly serious view of misuse of personal data and requires a data controller to take reasonable and proportionate steps to ensure the security of data held on its systems. The Labour Party takes our data protection obligations extremely seriously. Questioned by the Mirror, former Labour MP Chris Leslie denied he was the MP accused of accessing data. He said: We did think through in our checklist of things that had to be done, obviouslyyoud resigned your Labour membership, you dont have access to Labour facilities and data and all those other things.And things have got to be destroyed up to that point. Obviously while youre still a Labour MP and youre still a member of the Labour Party you have access and use of all of that data as it was.This is a process of separation andthe focus of the party is going to be to kind of pick holes in the process of that separation, so be it.But were trying our best to do this in as decent a way as possible.

Research shows  of them have ed, without any hue and cry about the threat they represent.Most of them were male. Many were jihadi fighters. But its a lot more fun to talk of stripping a young woman, who has been just as stupid but not nearly as fighty as them.Shamima Begum was found in a Syrian refugee camp last week, having left her Bethnal Green home in  with stolen money and her passport. She had married a convicted Dutch terrorist, suffered two infant deaths, and was heavily pregnant with her third. Perhaps her biggest mistake was not to say she missed fish and chips. Had she begged for forgiveness, forsook all Islamic trappings and spoken plaintively about missing Coronation Street shed probably be on a plane home by now.Instead - silly girl - someone inculcated into a religious cult as a child, groomed to marry and have sex underage, who watched two babies die in a war zone, and was so desensitised to horror that she got used to seeing decapitated heads in bins, muttered the things shes been told for the past  years. While, it must be said, living alongside, and still reliant upon, her fellow indoctrinees.  Cue the pitchforks - shes no remorse, shes a threat to us all, keep her at arms . The media lap it up, everyone thanks the Lord that were not talking about Brexit for once, and Home Secretary Sajid Javid bows to public pressure to strip her of citizenship on the basis she can always go to Bangladesh.Only trouble is, shes never lived in Bangladesh. Wasnt born there, and previous citizenship appeals have ruled its illegal to force people to live there. Its not even clear shes ever applied to be a Bangladesh citizen, or that theyd accept her nowshe did. On top of all that, she gave birth days before Javid found his headline-grabbing loophole, so her son is a British citizen with a right to , and he can hardly get himself here from Syria without her.In fact there are  incredibly good and sane reasons why we should welcome Shamima - and all the other jihadis, jihadi brides and their children - home with open arms. The thoughtless mob, and the racists and ambitious politicians stoking it, wont like any of them. . Justice  When a British national commits a crime abroad, they serve their time in that country before being repatriated to the UK. In the case of notorious pop paedo Gary Glitter, he flitted between Spain, Cuba, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, fleeing justice and being arrested, jailed and deported more than once. When he finally came home, he was sentenced to  years for sex offences.Shamima Begum cant face justice in Syria, because there is none. Its a largely-failed state run by a dictator and bombed to obliteration.She is our problem. She was born, raised and radicalised here. If she has committed an offence by being a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation, she has a right to a fair trial, due process, andconvicted some jail time.The only way Shamima - and the  other Brit women found in the camps - can EVER face justice isshe comes home.Besides,we ever want to deport a foreign criminal again we need to obey the rules we want to use. Otherwise theres nothing to stop other states - Bangladesh, say - telling us to keep the bomber to ourselves. . Intelligence Of the  who have ed, you can be sure that  of them have been questioned by the security services. They were pumped for information, passwords, names and places. Some will have been turned into double agents, others jailed, and some cut loose as losers who saw the error of their ways. They will all be under scrutiny of some sort.Those who dont come home dont talk. They dont feed information into the intelligence machine, and dont make bargains infor their freedom.If Shamima is not in the UKs jurisdiction, weve no right to question her. We dont co-operate with the Syrian regime, so cant sit in while they question her with pliers. The ONLY way to squeeze Shamima - to find out who and what she knows, to ensure we can capture others with the same madness - is to bring her back.. Redemption Perhaps most importantly of all, jihadis who have no home dont get deradicalised. They continue to float around the worlds worst places, dealing with the worlds worst people, hating the UK and all it stands for. Shamimas child - a Brit with the potential to be an upstanding, contributing citizen - will be radicalised too.Imagine , in a year or two, she is linked to an atrocity abroad, or her child is once hes grown. We could have saved those lives, but have chosen not to try.There are also any number of countries from which Shamima could board a flight to the UK. Once here, she could claim a right to remain as mother of a British son she could claim asylum, perhaps,subject to justice in a country like Syria or she could blow the plane to pieces. It does not make us safer to keep Shamima away it makes her a BIGGER danger. Its worth bearing in mind those  who have ed are living unnoticed - so by definition arent causing trouble.. Solutions Shamima was an academically-successful -year-old from a cosmopolitan city whose immediate family, according to their lawyer, were not particularly religious. Somehow she was sold the ISIS ideology - that the apocalypse was coming soon, and anyone not living in Syria in an Islamically-fundamentalist way would not get to heaven.How someone exposed to a globalised, inter-connected world, one where the entirety of human knowledge was available on a computer in our pockets, can come to believe such tripe is worthy of thought. If the tripe leads them to think blowing up children in Manchester Arena is justied, that a convicted terrorist is a perfect husband and heads in bins is merely a sign of good street hygiene, its worthy of serious investigation.When promises of apocalypse are proven , believers lose their faith. We need Shamima to come to her senses, then tell us what she saw and heard before she left. Who she spoke to, who advised her, how it worked. Then and only then can we stop it happening to others.If we keep her out, well never be less ignorant than we are. .

The frontbencher told the Mirror they would look for Remain-supporting constituencies - and agree “non-aggression pacts” with Lib Dems so they did not split the pro-EU, centrist vote.

They put the overweight pooch on a special diet and her weight plummeted to st lbs. Offers to re-home the plump pooch came flocking in but her rescuer has now decided to adopt her and become her permanent owner. Ruth Rickard, , deputy manager at Gables Farm shelter in Plymouth, Devon, said she couldnt give her up as she had taken a special liking to her.  I couldnt imagine her living with anyone . I did get very attached to her and all her little funny ways, she admitted. Hattie was morbidly obese, diabetic and almost blind when she arrived at the dogs and cats home in April last year. Speaking at the time, Ruth said: When I first saw Hattie I couldn’t believe it as she looked more like a pot-bellied pig than a dog. I just knew we had to try and help her. I take her home with me at night so I can administer her insulin injections, which she tolerates very well. As the weight has started to come off we have found that she is very spirited and extremely loving, despite the fact we put her on a diet.   She spends her days in our reception, keeping an eye on the staff and customers, and as we watch her gain confidence and lose weight it makes me proud that we are a genuine non euthanasia charity. A healthy female collie should weigh between  and kg, but Hattie is currently kg - the same weight as a small dear or two full bags of concrete. Hattie is on a strictly controlled diet to lose the weight slowly and safely and, to date, she’s managed to shed kg. Ruth added: “We have seen some wrecked animals that we have found homes for after proper care, nutrition and TLC. “I try to be positive. I’m aiming to get her down to about  kilos. “We are trying to get her to go out four or five times a day.   She was over kg, we’ve got the previous vet history - I don’t think the owner was very well. “She’s only six years old. For a collie, she should be looking at a -year le expectancy. “She’s quite a character, she so deserves the public to get behind her. “Since she started losing weight, she’s changed - it was like she had no real enjoyment of le before and was just existing. Ruth said she recalled mistaking the plump pup for a pot-bellied pig when she walked through the door. The eight-year-old collie-cross, who was rescued by the RSPCA over welfare concerns, was put on a strict regime of diet and exercise to help her lose weight safely. The charity also set up a fundraiser to help cover her vet bills, including twice-daily insulin shots and cataracts surgery to restore her vision.

Semi-finalist Merlin Cadogan, , stays in the Devon home where Britains most notorious female killer grew up. Rose went on to murder victims with husband Fred - several of whom they buried under their patio in Cromwell Street. Escape artist Merlin now lives in the property where she was raised in Northam and says he recently became nervous when digging up the garden to install a decking. But he says when he did he found a plastic toy deep in the soil. Merlin said: When we moved in I looked up in the attic. There was something up there nailed to one of the wooden cross beam joists. It looked like a shield or symbol from some sort of army regiment. It had a crest with thistles on it. I was too freaked out to touch it, but I did do a bit of research into it.   Apparently many people used to do this so that loved ones could always find their way home. Its still up there now, but I dont knowits got anything to do with Rose Wests family. I must admit, when I was digging up the garden I was a bit nervous. Id like to say I found something interesting that could have been hers, but all I found was a little toy plastic horse, which probably had nothing to do with her.  West, who together with her husband Fred are believed to be responsible for at least  murders, grew up in the house in Morwenna Park Road. It was here when her father, Bill Letts, a paranoid schizophrenic, beat and tortured his family. He began sexually grooming Rose and by the age of , she was sexually abusing her two younger brothers too.   The former home on is now owned by Merlin, an escapologist and juggler who made the semi-finals of Britains Got Talent back in . Merlin has done a fair bit of work to the s semi-detached pad he now shares with his girlfriend Catherine, her two children Riley and Casey, and his daughter Lu. Among the work was decking the rear garden and levelling out the front garden for gravel. And he said his heart did skip a beat as he delved into what was underneath. Rose, now , is said to have became a sex abuser at , a murderer at  and a fully fledged serial killer while still in her teens. Merlin, , who also holds the world record for the longest time juggling three objects underwater on a single breath, has lived at the former council house since .   He says he knew about Roses connection with the house before he bought it. It never bothered me, he added. I heard she had lived there when she was young, but she was only a child then, just a little kid. We bought it from a lovely family  years ago and it has probably changed hands several times since she lived here. It certainly didnt put me off buying the house. Merlin says he doesnt think any of the children know about who used to live at the house. But he added: Its just a house.  Rose was born in Northam in November . After a troubled childhood at the age of  she fell in love with  year old Fred West. The couple moved together to Gloucester at the beginning of the s and began more than a decade of sexual abuse and murder. Fred West killed himself in HMP Birmingham while on remand accused of murdering  girls and women in  before he could stand trial. We Rose, remains locked up at Low Newton prison in County Durham after being convicted of murdering  victims. From  to , nine victims were buried at the House of Horrors on Cromwell Street, Gloucester. To this day, West still denies her role in the murders.

But when he started to choke at a restaurant on the site paramedics found they couldnt get to the youngster because the path was blocked by gates and bollards, the hearing was told. The toddler, from Battle, East Sussex, had previously needed medical attention in the past because he had trouble with choking, the inquest heard. James was taken to hospital but died on June . His local GP, the South East Coast Ambulance service, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust and Butlins were all represented at a pre-inquest review hearing.   James mum Natalie was also present as were other members of his family. Assistant Coroner Karen Harrold said: Having listened to the  call, I am concerned about the handling of that telephone call and whether the paramedics had specic instructions as to how to get in. Given James was two and choking it seems to me that every second counted. I am concerned about the delay in getting cars through the gates. She also told the hearing she was concerned that once on site the paramedics were impeded by gates and retractable bollards that were locked into place. One paramedic made the decision to run to James because the ambulance could not get through the bollards, the inquest heard.   Ms Harrold said: There should have been a clear path through. There should not have been any delay at all. When paramedics arrived they reported seeing that safety staff were standing around doing nothing, she told the inquest. Mum Natalie said: I tried my best and literally every member of the public was trying to help. There were not any First Aiders on site who helped us. The inquest will also look at what happened in the three or four month period between a doctor referring James for an operation and his death. Mum Natalie said: It was me having to get onto doctors and bang on the doors. The inquest was adjourned until a full hearing on a date to be set.

Landlady Ellie Boiling says The Dolphin in Littlehampton, West Sussex, is plagued with ghosts and she has even had guests run out in terror. The footage shows a punter enjoying a drink in the pub when a spectral white figure appears behind him, approaches and then vanishes. “He was the most sceptic man I’ve ever met in my le,” said Ellie, . “He was lucid, he wasn’t drunk or anything. “He phoned me and said: ‘I’ve just seen something go past me, can you look on your CCTV to see what it was ’ “I rewound it and I was like ‘Oh my God’.   “I was shocked, I wasn’t expecting to see anything – I thought maybe it was a dog or something – but there it was. “He was a sceptic and he was shaken. All his beliefs seemed to have gone out the window.” The landlady and self-styled ghost hunter says the spooks at the pub include a former cook who was murdered by her abusive uncle, as well as the malevolent spirit of the uncle himself. She claims there’s also the spectre of a man in RAF fatigues, the ghost of a woman in white, and a mischievous spook who throws p coins at customers. Some guests have even fled in the middle of the night, Ellie said. “There was a man and woman who once stayed in room two – they paid cash for the whole week,” she said. “On the first night he came down in a little towel and he said ‘you’ve got to move me!’ He said ‘somebody has just floated through my door and out through the window’. They were absolutely hysterical. “I moved them up to room six and I knocked on the door in the morning to give them breakfast, and they’d gone.   “So I checked my CCTV and they left at half past four in the morning… they didn’t want their money back, they’ve never been in touch, and I never heard from them again.” Ellie says the haunting at The Dolphin is so severe that one room has even been shut off to guests. She believes that room is haunted by a ghost child whose portrait is preserved on a photographic plate discovered in the pub. “I named this girl Little Dolly because everybody calls my pub The Dolly,” she said. But Ellie was more than a bit spooked when a mysterious stranger entered the pub one day and revealed that the nickname was far older than she’d realised. “He said ‘my grandad used to own this pub  years ago and he had  children. One unfortunately died of diphtheria, up in the old nursery I believe, and her name was Little Dolly.’  “And he took me to the grave just up the road and there it was. Her name was Ada Constance Parish and inscribed above it, it said ‘Little Dolly’. “I didn’t know that was her name. I just called her that because of the pub’s nickname.” For Ellie, the pubs reputation as a haunt for ghosts is well deserved. “I’ve been a ghost hunter for  years and I’ve been around. “I do many charity ghost hunts and go round people’s houses to help them – but this is by far the most active haunting I’ve ever experienced.” The pub itself dates back to  and has welcomed guests including Lord Byron, Oliver Reed and Benny Hill.

At the time of having my large bowel removed, I didnt want to have a stoma bag, as I thought that it would completely ruin my le, said Ben. In the end though, that kind of thinking was silly, as the bag in fact saved my le and really improved it. Now I dont have to worry about any flare ups or stress about where the nearest loos are, which I had to do before I got my bag. My stoma is permanent as my rectum has been taken permanently away through surgery, and since then Ive had a fistula - a hole in my body - that took time to heal.   Ive also had more surgery in November  to try and fix a cavity that developed, but it was unsuccessful. I went in again for an operation last month, but again it didnt work, so Im now trying medication to try and fix the problem.

He said: Having my stoma bag has enabled me to live a normal le - I work in retail, but Im off at the moment whilst I recover from surgery but I dont let it get me down and Im slowly getting better. Im also studying at the moment to become a personal trainer.  I feel lucky to be alive. I know that some people who also have stoma bags like me can get upset about it but I just want to inspire others that our bags are there for a reason, and that we should wear them with pride. The reaction to Bens videos have been overwhelmingly positive and he says he is all too happy to have made a positive impact.Ive had a great reaction with all my posts on Facebook , and I was real surprised with the , shares that I got after posting a picture of me with my bag after Seven Bridges sadly committed suicide after being bullied about his bag.Im happy to have been able to educate people and raise awareness of Crohns disease and colitis and hopefully to make a dference.

The couple, who are due to become parents in the next few weeks, are nearly always seen holding hands and stroking each others backs when out and about at official events. Most fans love their behaviour and many have said its refreshing to see members of the Royal Family so obviously in love.But relationship expert Sheela Mackintosh-Stewart is concerned about the behaviour and claims it could overshadow Meghans important charity work.She told the Express : The old-fashioned British value of humility is not Meghans strongest suit and reports of her financial extravagance have grated on the public.  This image is overshadowing Meghans extensive charity work and her patronage of the Grenfell Tower cookery book in September. Modesty can translate to quiet authority and this is a powerful tool for winning over the public. For instance, senior Royals never hold their spouses’ hands whilst on public Royal duties, a tradition that Meghan and Harry rejected to the irritation of many. It is unwise to pander to naysayers, but given the strength of backlash, it would be wise to take heed and keep hand holding to a minimum. Sometimes less is more. But many people will probably disagree with her statement, as the couples fans cant get enough of their affectionate relationship.  Writing on Twitter , one wrote: This is unnecessary.

She said: She was edging forward, she was just nudging her way forward. Her car tapped the pram, causing it to swing around. Driver Judy Williams had been sitting in her car on the other side of the carriageway when she noticed the Fiesta edging forward. Miss Williams said: An elderly man started crossing the road and the females followed behind. As the man got to the central reservation the two females were in the lane nearest to me. The blue Ford Fiesta started to pull forward. Driver Miss Williams said she then spotted Jenkins waving her arms and shouting in the car. She said: The lady was pointing. She was shouting: The lights are green. The lights are green. She was angry. She was waving her hands shouting. She just seemed angry.

Over just seven days, a DOZEN other UK women have descended on displacement camps in the area, BBC News reports. The circumstances surrounding why these women travelled to Syria and how they have ended up at the camps is unclear.  Speaking from the Middle East last night, BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville said: This whole issue of what to do with these IS women and other IS supporters isnt going to go away.We know that in the last week alone,  British women have arrived at displacement camps here in northern Syria. So for the British Government, this headache of what to do doesnt end with Shamima Begum. Begum, from Bethnal Green, east London, is not the first ISIS supporter to have been stripped of their British citizenship.

International law forbids nations from making people stateless by revoking their only citizenship, while Government guidance from  states that the Home Secretary has the power to order the deprivationit would be conducive to the public good, and as long as they are not left without any citizenship. However, Begums lawyer told the Press Association that the teenager - who is of Bangladeshi heritage - was born in the UK, has never had a Bangladeshi passport and is not a dual citizen.   The Home Office said such decisions are not taken lightly and are carried out in order to protect this country.

In light of the circumstances of your daughter, the notice of the Home Secretarys decision has been served of file today , and the order removing her British citizenship has subsequently been made.   The document asked the teenagers mum to inform her daughter of the decision, as well as her right to appeal. Begum, who gave birth to Jarrah on Saturday, has made pleas for forgiveness and to be accepted back in the UK. This week, she compared the Manchester Arena bombing to military strikes on ISIS strongholds, calling the terror attack retaliation. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has signalled she could be arrested and investigatedshe s to Britain. There are currently plans to change the law to make travelling to certain terror hotspots a criminal offence, but this would not apply retrospectively to Begum.

to be done to bring roads in Inverness up to a standard that makes them safe and easy for road users to navigate, a leading cycling campaigner has said.Brian MacKenzie, convener of the Highland Cycle Campaign, said: ldquoI cycle a lot and there is no doubt the roads in the town are in very poor condition.ldquoThe trunk roads, too, need attention.Championing the cause for better and safer routes for cyclists he said drivers also need to be aware of cyclists and give greater consideration to them.ldquoDrivers often criticise cyclists when they see them weaving along certain routes but often they are doing that simply to avoid potholes and are taking evasive action, he said.ldquoAt the Raigmore Interchange, on the ramp joining the A south from the A, there is a pothole which has been there for some time. It is now gathering water and there is a warning sign for traffic alerting them to flooding.ldquoThere are also two more long potholes which are much more dangerous for cyclists and motorists just as you enter the interchange off the northbound ramp, coming from the Beechwood direction of the A.ldquoThe seal between the interchange and the ramp has gone andyou are cycling along there on a dark night you canrsquot see it, so your wheel can get caught up in it. These are like tram lines and they could throw you off a bike and cause serious injury.ldquoEvery vehicle coming from the A has to go across these potholes as they enter the interchange as well and they have been like that for a considerable time.ldquoI am wondering when the trunk roads people are going to carry out these repairs.While Highland Council is responsible for the upkeep of most roads in Inverness and the surrounding towns and villages, Bear Scotland is responsible for trunk roads.A spokesman for the organisation told the Courier last week that major defects, including deeppotholes which could pose a danger to road users, are repaired within  days, with safety inspections of all roads under its care inspected on a weekly basis.Wednesday  Feb  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302-124x067.jpg","title":"Tree felling works on A82 in Inverness","story":"Temporary traffic management measures will be in place along a section of the A Glenurquhart Road in Inverness from Tuesday of next week.Tree felling works will be taking place at Torvean Golf Course over three days as part of preparatory works for the second stage of the West Link project.Traffic management will be in place between .amand pm from Tuesday to Friday Motorists should expect some delays during this time.Wednesday  Feb  : PM"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"mr versatile hoping for permanent deal option with dons","story":"On-loan Rotherham defender Dom Ball hopes signing on at Pittodrie on a permanent deal is an option this summer.The -year-old’s contract at the Championship club expires at the end of this term.Following a successful season-long loan at Pittodrie in -, Ball ed last summer for a second campaign.Ball had suffered with a back injury since the winter training camp in Dubai but is now fully fit again and hopes to face St Johnstone away on Saturday.There are only  league games before the end of the Premiership campaign and Ball hopes extending his time with Aberdeen is on the table.He said: “My contract is up at the end of the summer so I am in my last year. I will see what happens.“At the moment I am just hoping to get back in and get back playing. Hopefully there are options, and hopefully there is an option here.”The former England Under- international has shown his versatility by operating at centre-back, full-back and defensive midfield.He could be pitched into right-back for Saturday’s Premiership trip due to a defensive crisis.Right-back Shaleum Logan is set to be ruled out with an ankle injury that required him to see a specialist this week.On-loan Watford centre-back Tommie Hoban is out for the season with a cruciate ligament injury sustained in the - draw with St Mirren. He will undergo knee surgery.Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna will also serve out the final match of a three-game suspension.Aberdeen are five points behind second-placed Rangers, but Ball is confident the Ibrox side can still be overhauled in the bid to secure a runners-up finish for a fth successive season.On whether there is still time to catch the Gers, he said: “Definitely. There are enough games left and we will take each game as it comes from now.“Then when it gets to the post-split we can analyse and assess where we want to go from there.“Things change in the post-split.”Ball recently became an internet hit when a video of him singing about striker Sam Cosgrove’s goalscoring prowess was uploaded on keeper Joe Lewis’s Twitter account.While playing guitar Ball sings about Cosgrove going for the Ballon d’Or, which has become a popular chant with Dons fans when the centre- forward scores.The footage was recorded at one of the Reds players’ regular nights where they meet to watch a Champions League match and play cards and board games.Ball insists that bond will be vital as the pressures ramp up in the season’s finale.“It is mainly for Champions League games and there are board games, cards and singing,” he said.“There are quite a few of us up here on our own so it is just something to do to get out really.“The team spirit of this group, and last year as well, was great.“That is credit to the coaching staff and the players that they bring in.“Everyone is a good person and everyone in the dressing room likes everyone .“We all get on outside of football. On the pitch there is that competitiveness for places but that respect for everyone as well.“With the period coming up that team spirit will help us massively.”Cosgrove will not win the Ballon d’Or but he could secure the Tartan Boot for leading Premiership goal scorer.The Dons’ striker is on  Premiership goals, just one behind Rangers’ Alfredo Morelos.Ball said: “Itwas just a bit of a laugh to start with and it was quite funny. Since then Sam has sort of lived up to it.“I think it is brilliant.“The fact everyone is talking about the Ballon d’Or – I know it is not realistic, but he is dealing with the expectation of scoring goals, which he did in December.“Sam has carried that on, which has been massive for us.“The gaffer and his staff have put their trust in Sam to go in there.“And when you get a goal you get that confidence.“As soon as you get on that run and you get that confidence and games you can start improving and developing.“I was out of the squad injured for the Hearts gameand I remember watching Sam.“It wasn’t just the two goals Sam scored, it was his overall performance.“Every single part of it in that game was nearly perfect.“You can see that in training and he is starting to become an all-round player.“It is helping the team massively.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/5c63e816d777e2.10198285.jpg ","title":"signs good for pauls return","story":"Aberdeen#s Paul Lawrie says the “signs are good” ahead of histo Tour action.Lawrie, , will play the Oman Open next week, before the Qatar Masters –starting March  – after recovering from foot surgery.The  Open champion at Carnoustie, Lawrie ended his  season early to finally have a problem taken care of which developed before Europe’s miraculous Ryder Cup victory at Medinah in .“Chippy”, as he is affectionately known because of his watertight short-game, said: “We’ve booked our flights and hotel for Oman and Qatar, so I’m on my way.“I’ve only played two  holes – two full rounds since surgery.“So I thought Oman and Qatar being out there and a little bit warmer would help me see where I am, where my game is and whether I can crack on and play or not.“The signs are good, my foot’s been brilliant. My back’s not been %, but you’d expect that from such a long lay-off.“I’ve not played on the Tour properly since April.”Lawrie, who yesterday announced his new charity Pro-Am event to be held at Gleneagles on July , has spoken often of how a problem which started as an uncontrollable tapping of his left foot when he played developed into the foot collapsing every time he swung the club.However, the now Senior Tour-eligible player, revealed how a chance encounter finally got to the root of the issue.Lawrie said: “I was in Lundin Links’ clubhouse after I’d announced I wasn’t going to play again the rest of the year and Stuart Barton, a physio, was behind me in the queue.“He said: ‘I’m really sorry to hear. I know you’ve had lots of people having a look at it, but I’ve got a practice just up the road, I’d love to have a look.’“He asked me to walk up and down and straight away he said: ‘you’ve got a ruptured tendon and problem with the ligament in your foot, that’s why it’s collapsing when you swing.’“He contacted Gordon Mackay, who’s one of his best mates.“I was in Munich and everywhere trying to get my foot fixed and Stuart noticed it straight away.“I’d never met him before.“But I’ve been rehabbing with him the whole way through. He’s phenomenal at his job, just phenomenal.”Mackay performed Lawrie’s surgery in September and the golfer says the medic is delighted with his progress.He said: “He’s extremely happy.“I think it’s taken a bit longer than he thought to recover.“I probably started hitting balls a bit early.“It was quite a big op he did and a big scar on my foot.“I had a ruptured tendon, torn ligament and some bone spurs on it.“You just assume nowadays itis going to be keyhole or whatever.“You’re looking at  or  weeks, but for me it’s been a bit longer.”Lawrie is now painkiller free while playing for the first time in “six or seven years”.He said his foot felt “really strong” while playing at Montrose in the North-east Alliance last week.In his time off he’s had plenty to smile about, with long-time Paul Lawrie Foundation player David Law winning on the European Tour for the first time – at the ISPS Handa Vic Open in Australia – after only five starts.Lawrie, who thinks Law’s biggest asset is the unteachable ability to win coming down the stretch when he’s got the chance, said: “He came in on Monday with his little girl – and I met him when he was a little boy.“I’m chuffed for him, and you can see from the reaction to his win what a popular guy and nice boy he is.“I’ve not seen a reaction like that for a long time.“He’d be the first to admit it happened quicker than he would’ve thought – he’s only played five events as a full cardholder.“It’s up to him , but he’s obviously going to get a lot of confidence from that.“We had our chat this week.“He’s got to knuckle down pretty quickly and get back on the range, get back on the chipping green.“He’ll have spells coming up where he doesn’t play his best and he’s got to dig in.”Lawrie is also pleased with how another protege, Sam Locke, has adjusted to pro le after winning the Silver Medal for top amateur at Carnoustie last summer, revealing he’s had chats with the -year-old about the importance of getting the ball in the hole above all  at this level.The Farmfoods Paul Lawrie Invitational at Gleneagles will see groups of one Tour pro, one celebrity and two amateurs tee it up for charities, including Lawrie’s foundation, the Doddie Weir Foundation and Beatson.Taking place on the Monday between the Scottish Open at the Renaissance Club and Open at Royal Portrush, Lawrie hopes the event will prove popular.His annual challenge match in the north-east will be unaffected, with Women’s Open winner Catriona Matthew this year’s opponent.Lawrie said: “We also have the Paul Lawrie Challenge Match at the golf centre – that’s still going to go ahead.“I’m playing Catriona Matthew this year, so I better get practising.“That’s on July  at the golf centre.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"cheers pub loving citizen year","story":"NewsCheers to the pub-loving Citizen of the YearTroon community hero is presented with the silverware in the Harbour BarShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsProud moment - Iain Wilson accepts Troon Citizen of Year from Community Council chair Helen Duff \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere was only one place Troon’s new Citizen of the Year wanted to receive the silverware . . . in his local pub.

Neil Slider, , was even followed off the bus by the girls who demanded to see his phone and his photos. “They believed he was taking photos of them,” said depute fiscal Ed Sheeran at Ayr Sherf Court. “They challenged the accused, he denied it, saying ‘**** off, I don’t have any photos, I’m not showing you my phone’.” Slider pleaded guilty to threatening or abusive behaviour towards the girls by shouting and swearing at them. But he totally denied doing anything of an improper sexual nature. Defence lawyer Tony Currie told the court: “He’s a genuine first offender, and there’s no risk of him re-offending. “There was a misunderstanding, and they challenged him to the point of following him off the bus when it wasn’t their stop. He had dropped his phone at one point, but the only photo it took was of the floor on the bus.” The lawyer added: “He was particularly concerned because where he comes from this type of offence would not meet with approval.” Mr Currie said his client had real fears about the possible repercussions,and had learned a salutary lesson. The court heard that Slider, of Schaw Avenue, Drongan, had to report twice a week to police in Ayr in the aftermath of the original charge against him. It dates back to November , in Glencraig Street, Drongan. But taking photos of two girls who were aged  at the time was removed from the charge Slider pled guilty to in court last week. Slider’s bail condition, reporting to police in Ayr’s King Street on Mondays and Fridays has now been revoked. Sherf Mhari Mactaggart decided to defer sentence on Slider for a period of six months to seehe can be of good behaviour.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsCourtsEd Sheeran"},{"url":null,"title":"make cash bid 46 year","story":"NewsMake a cash bid for a -year-old beautyDriver hands over MG Midget to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer SupportShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsOpen top motoring - Josh Hollywood and Nicola Eyres of Ayrshire Cancer Support with the mint condition MG \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDo you fancy a gorgeous blood red MG Midget  The stunning .L engine convertible was gted to Ayrshire Cancer Support by a kind hearted anonymous donor.

Bus firm Stagecoach had followed up on a request to carry out a site visit for a proposed stop at Hollybush Inn after a bus user called for improvement last year. Stranded Suzanne Anderson, , hit out at Stagecoach bosses in December after she was left walking along a dangerous road when a driver failed to stop at Hollybush Inn. Suzanne, of Patna, insisted the stop had always been a ‘traditional unofficial stop’ but the bus firm confirmed this was not the case- nor had it been for ‘many years’. She appealed to Stagecoach to implement an official stop after she left to walk along the busy  mph zone A to the next bus stop. Suzanne previously told the Post: “It’s always been a traditional unofficial stop. “I then had to walk along a dangerous road to another stop to catch a bus.   “They come flying along that road at some speed. Prevention is better than a cure. If that happens to someone  and they had to walk along the road and a lorry comes thundering down- who knows what could happen.” Despite Stagecoach stating Hollybush Inn is not a registered stop, the firm raised the request to install an official one with transport agency SPT. And with checks carried out, the unanimous decision was that the location is unsuitable for an official stop. A Stagecoach West Scotland spokensman said: “Following on from the information provided by the Ayrshire Post on December  in relation to a customer trying to board one of our services at the Hollybush Inn, we can advise that a site visit has been carried out by representatives of SPTand East Ayrshire Council. “It has been agreed that the suggested location is unsuitable for bus stops, due to road safety concerns and the lack of suitable footways. The location of bus stops is decided jointly by representatives of SPT and East Ayrshire Council Roads department with the prime considerations in assessing the suitability of sites being road and pedestrian safety.” "},{"url":null,"title":"weve bin refusemen dump recycling","story":"NewsWeve bin had as refusemen dump all recycling together in AyrAmazing footage shows binmen dumping all the recycling together in back of wagonShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.dailyrecord video video-watch-binmen-pour-separated-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrazen binmen were caught dumping loads of separated recycling into the back of the same refuse lorry. The shocking evidence makes a mockery of the new flagship South Ayrshire Council recycling policy, which has cost a fortune in public cash. The bin team were filmed as they uplted four giant refuse containers and put them all in the same wagon. The pair of hi-vis clad refusemen did not appear to care who was watching as all the waste was dumped into the back of their lorry, driven by a third council staffer. They were recorded on video for four minutes after they arrived at the bin corral in Ayr’s Newmarket Street. The binmen first lted the purple-lidded container for paper, card and cardboard then a green one for general waste, a blue for metal and plastic cartons before a fourth, which looks like another purple bin. It happened at .am on February . Our source said: “What I saw was disgusting. “How can these people look themselves in the eye  “The council has bombarded us with information and leaflets on our new recycling. “What is the point ” The evidence emerged following our report last week on the same thing happening in Girvan. Another resident on the outskirts of Ayr has said their bins had been mixed. Sarah McGhee said: “This practice could be widespread as friends of my husband Andy have reported the same thing. It is so disheartening for everybody who is separating everything and I am so angry. “I would feel happierthe council are now forced to let people into their recycling centre to see what is actually happening.” She watched from her kitchen window at Mainholm Smallholdings in the first week of January as the blue and green bins were emptied into the same load. The council rolled out the new system between October and last week and will continue to stage community roadshows to explain the system until next week. They want to reduce the , tons of household waste sent to landfill every year from , homes. It has not funded all the cost of the new bins and got a grant from Zero Waste Scotland. South Ayrshire Council is claiming their binmen took the action due to the PUBLIC and refused to issue rebuke to staff or apology. They alleged the rubbish had all been contaminated.A spokesman said: “The Council is committed to recycling as much as possible, unfortunately not everyone feels the same.Our recycling facilities in some areas, such as town centres, can be heavily contaminated by householders and the general public putting waste in the wrong bins.We have written to residents in the Newmarket Street area reminding them of their recycling responsibilities and we ask the public to use bins correctly so we don’t have to put contaminated recycling to landfill.”*Help us keep an eye on the recycling rogues.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves.

And they werenrsquot even dead or nuffink!Well, one of them was. Dr Legg, recently brought back into the fray, was being laid to rest, and there to pay their respects were Mary and Lofty.Now, come on, you remember them. Among the ways of finding out a personrsquos age, apart from cutting them in half and counting the ringsis to ask who their favourite EastEnder character is. If they say Mary the punk, or Lofty the big drink of water, they are definitely middle- aged.The day of the funeral dawned with curtains being drawn in only one of the houses in the Square. No-one holds with the old conventions now. Over in the market, Martin Fowler, who has had more faces than Ian Beale has had wives, was telling someone that Dr Legg had been a friend of his gran, Lou. Across the country, a lot of people suddenly felt very old.This being EastEnders there had to be some drama over the funeral. Dot, one of Dr Leggrsquos oldest friends, was due to read at the service but she was out of sorts. \"I can barely get a cuppa tea down her\", said Sonia, which in EastEnders is the equivalent of a hospital code blue.Just as Dr Leggrsquos soap le was being brought to a close another was starting, with the arrival of Masoodrsquos sparky nieces. They asked someone what time the restaurant opened. Sorry, havenrsquot been here for years, said a smartly dressed lady with a peroxide pixie crop. Mary!Mary had a grown up daughter with her , as did Sonia. Must have been a BOGOF offer at the Minute Mart.Next old face to turn up was Lofty who now owns  pubs. \"All well away from here,\" he tells Sharon. Well, obviously. Dangerous game running a pub in those parts. He asks after his ex, Michelle, who is off travelling. In reality, Michelle, played by Susan Tully, became a successful director and producer. Since wersquore catching up, Tom Wattmakes films for BT Sport, and ghost-wrote David Beckhamrsquos autobiography, while Linda Davidsonis something big in on-line ops.Down the Queen Vic after the service, Mary had a dig at Dot for calling her parents and telling them to take baby Annie away. Dot reminded Mary that she also told her to steer clear of Pat, who wanted to put Mary on the game. Pat as a madam. It was a reminder of how dark EastEnders once was, albeit in a grim down south, Loachian way. These days it too often plumps for sensationalism, and is much less effective.Cathy lightened the mood by reminding everyone of the hilarious time Dr Legg caught Loursquos bedcover in his bag and walked off, trailing it behind him. Sadly, that is what passes as comedy in EastEnders.The half hour almost up, Lofty gave Martin a cheque for lsquoChellersquos daughter, Vicky, the one he thought was his but was really Dirty Denrsquos .

EU leaders look on aghast as Mrs May continues her forlorn ring-round to get unlikely changes to the Northern Ireland backstop.Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn resists either backing Mrs Mayrsquos deal or supporting the Peoplersquos Vote that Labour voters and members want. A left-wing, pro-EU  could potentially garner big support in the polls, but Mr Corybn puts ideology ahead of political gains.Damaging uncertainty reigns with all outcomes still possible on Brexit: a no-deal chaotic Brexit, Mrs Mayrsquos hard but unclear Brexit, a compromise May-Corbyn Brexit , an extension to Article  or no Brexit at all.There is a triple stand-off going on, amidst this dishonest political posturing, between the executive, the legislature and the people. Theresa May looks powerless but is still standing despite the Commons rejecting her deal by  votes, her then backing the Brady amendment against her own deal , then losing again last Thursday by  votes as the hard Brexiters feared she was backing the Commons rejection of no deal.Yet Mrs May keeps running down the clock, desperately searching for a majority to carry the UK over the Brexit line. Mr Corbyn provides no serious opposition. Various smaller groupings in the Commons attempt to stop her while disagreeing on what should happenthey succeed. Government, opposition and the legislature as a whole are in the midst of a damaging breakdown.Meanwhile, the much-hyped ldquopeople are essentially ignored. The trope that the Commons is pro-Remain, reluctant to implement the ldquowill of the people, is simply wrong. There is a Remain majority across the UK , even in England. Yet the two main political parties, and most of their MPs, keep supporting Brexit but with no consensus still on what Brexit actually means.This is a deep democratic and political failure. Brexit is damaging our economy, our devolution settlement, our security and has trashed the UKrsquos international reputation. And yet the views of the - per cent of the public who now support Remain are not represented at this critical moment by the UKrsquos two main parties. In Scotland ndash and in the Commons ndash the SNP and the LibDems support Remain and another vote but, so far, to little effect, even with the support of Labour and Tory rebels. And Mrs Mayrsquos government has been shockingly ready to let Northern Irelandrsquos lack of executive and assembly drag on.Hoping to stop a no-deal Brexit, Yvette Cooper is putting forward a cross-party amendment next week to demand an Article  delay. She doesnrsquot say how long or what for ndash both things the EU will surely demand to know since they must agree any delay unanimously. But her amendment must lack clarity to have a chance of passing.Another amendment from Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson suggests the Commons back Mrs Mayrsquos deal on the condition of another referendum. Itrsquos a rather tawdry politics that needs MPs to vote for something they oppose to get something, a Peoplersquos Vote, they could just vote directly for.If Ms Cooper succeeds, Mrs May would have to pass her deal by mid-March or request an Article  extension rather than chasing a reckless las- minute Commons vote after the EUrsquos March  summit. Yet, whether in mid- or end-March, the EU could reject delay, or set unpalatable conditions. Or the EU might tell the UK to go away for a year and sort out its political breakdown .Read more: Brexit Day still March  insists GovernmentMeanwhile, dferent groups that oppose Brexit still play into Mrs Mayrsquos timetable. The Peoplersquos Vote campaign have called for a big demonstration on March  which only makes senseBrexit decisions are dangerously delayed until three days before Brexit.Nicola Sturgeon too keeps delaying any decision on another independence referendum. She is waiting for a clear Brexit outcome, something our failing politics looks unlikely to deliver. A chaotic no-deal or a fudged delay will not clary the options for future UK-Scotland relations but either may sharply intensy the independence debate. The Scottish Government must either take a decision amidst uncertainty or embrace the politics of delay too.Brexit shows clearly that the UKrsquos politics is broken and desperately needs modernising. A written constitution and proportional representation for Westminster voting would be a good start. The two big parties need to splitand England has work to do on its own identity and regional politics.And the UK should step back from Brexit so it can start to mend its politics without its economy, security and reputation going down the drain in parallel. Amidst such political and constitutional renewal, the UK could exploretherersquos a new federal model that could work while offering Scotland the chance to decideit wants to break away or be part of that renewal ndash and letting Northern Ireland,it wants, hold a border poll.Yet listing these basic modernisation steps underlines how unlikely they are and how far UK politics is from rescuing itself. Brexit is not the only cause of the UKrsquos political implosion but itrsquos the main immediate trigger. And careering towards a damaging, possibly no-deal Brexit will only intensy that political collapse.Brexit might yet be halted, whether through revoking Article  or holding a successful Peoplersquos Vote. If so, the long, hard work of political renewal could possibly begin. But it wonrsquot be quick or easy.Five weeks before the Brexit deadline, the UK is dependent on its powerless Government and a ided Westminster to rescue itself from this ever deeper crisis. It might happen.

He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution.

He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised.

Connelly has worked in traffic control since  so theres not much he hasnt seen. The Beast from the East brought the worst weather conditions hes encountered during his many years of service. The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

Accessible and affordable transport is a leline for many rural residents, connecting people to opportunities for socialising, working, learning and healthcare. The research in Inverurie will seek to understand the needs of the community in a rural Scottish location, including residents and local businesses and see how current transport services are meeting those needs.Findings will be used to develop and design new services that can be trialled in rural areas.Jenny Milne, from JLM said: “This project provides a great opportunity to understand the challenges travelling to, in and around Inverurie. By working with the community, it will help to understand what transport services are needed, and what steps can then be taken to improve existing routes around the town. “The project also hopes to engage the villages around Inverurie.“By using focus groups and asking the local community about their ideas, it will help to shape rural transport to the benefit of those living in the area.”The project also has support from Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon: “I would urge local residents and businesses in the Inverurie area to take part in this project and make their views known.“Many people depend upon public transport in rural areas – to get to work, to socialise or to keep appointments at local GP and dental surgeries.“We are fortunate in Inverurie to have a train station connecting the town with Aberdeen and Inverness and there has recently been major investment in the line. “However, in more remote parts of Aberdeenshire, public transport is less reliable and frequent.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time. It is up to us to keep fighting. There is parking available in the town so the problem can be overcome.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupWednesday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PORTREE-BRAES-TRUST-FIONA-AND-SOPHIE-2.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

James is  years old and is a professional cookery apprentice at the Galgorm Resort  Spa Hotel and Northern Regional College. James was studying for his A-Levels in Nutrition and Food Science, Le and Health Sciences and Applied ITC at Cambridge House Grammar School when he had the opportunity to take up work experience in Antrim’s Ramble Inn. For James – who had always dreamed of being a chef – his time in the Inn’s kitchens led to the realisation that his passion could be his full-time career. When he found out about the apprenticeships with Northern Regional College and the Galgorm Resort  Spa, he jumped at the chance. He said: “I love the creativity that comes with being a chef, you get to make people happy with your food.“So when I was given the chance to learn more and get hands-on experience in the kitchens of one of the biggest players in Northern Ireland’s hospitality sector I just couldn’t pass up that opportunity. It was a no-brainer for me!”James decided to leave school after his AS-Levels and hasn’t looked back since: “I really enjoyed school and I had thought that afterwards I would maybe go on to catering college. However, this apprenticeship is a chance to get experience in the industry and offers me an immediate route into the career I love – why would I put that off for another year ” What does a typical day at the work look like for James  At the moment, he has an enviable position looking after the restaurant’s delectable range of desserts. This means weighing out and prepping ingredients, plating up panna cotta, sticky toffee pudding and cheesecake and making sure the Galgorm’s fridges never run low of sweet treats. If you’re lucky enough to be on campus on a Wednesday, you might even get to sample some of James’ cooking. He and his colleagues spend their morning whipping up meals and being assessed on their abilities. Their top-class cooking is served up to hungry staff and students in the canteen. The afternoon is spent familiarising themselves with the extensive health and safety rules which every chef must know. When asked why he chose the apprenticeship route James says that for him it was the obvious choice: “With the apprenticeship you get to earn while you learn, and you have no student loans to worry about paying back at the end.”But most importantly, it’s the hands-on experience he has received throughout his training which James claims is most valuable.“You can read in a text-book that a professional kitchen is a high-pressure environment, but unless you’ve been in there at peak dinner-serving time, you can’t truly understand it.” James says he would “most definitely” recommend the apprenticeship scheme to someone : “If you want to go into the hospitality sector, I honestly think it’s the smartest career move you can make.” And his advice to them  “Just go for it! You have nothing to lose and so much to gain!”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Sinn Féin must stop speaking out of both sides of their mouth.“No-one can defend the recent scandal of the PSNI failing to disclose information to the Police Ombudsman regarding the Sean Graham bookmakers mass shooting, and the major systemic issues relating to the handling of legacy by the PSNI. However, the SDLP, unlike Sinn Féin, have legally based and rigorous proposals to improve PSNI recruitment and legacy inquiries and disclosure.

He said the attack was only called off because even the UVFs bloodthirsty leadership in Belfast considered it a step too far.The same claims were made in the past by former RUC officer Billy McCaughey, now deceased, who was convicted alongside Weir for the sectarian murder of a chemist in Ahoghill in .Filmmaker Sean Murray spent four years working on the documentary.Former Glenanne Gang terrorist John Weir seen in \"John Weir said he firmly believed it was British intelligence, thats what I also believe,\" he said.\"When I say that, I mean hawks within British intelligence, as I think there was an internal power battle going on. \"There were people who would have been against that, but the hawks wanted a gloves-off approach to the IRA. Its quite revealing the UVF were unwilling to go through with this.\"He said he was prepared for any backlash against the film, adding that all of Weirs statements had been corroborated by the Historical Enquiries Team.\"I think films like this are the only viable option for some semblance of the truth for victims, particularly against state violence,\" he added.\"I hope to see similar films like this coming from all sides here, because theres no owners of history. Its a mosaic of dferent stories, eventhey are competing.\"In recent days the PSNI has faced criticism for failing to disclose legacy files to the Police Ombudsman over the Sean Graham bookmakers atrocity of  in which five Catholics were murdered by the UFF.\"That feeds into what were trying to say in Unquiet Graves. There isnt a lot of trust for the PSNI in certain sections of the community,\" said Mr Murray.\"Trust needs to be built for both communities to move on.\" Growing up in west Belfast, he said he and many others saw the UDR and RUC in the same way others viewed the IRA. \"I viewed them as de facto paramilitary groups,\" he added. \"But Im still willing to speak and work with former members of the UDR and RUC to move forward.\"AskedWeir gave him an insight into the Glenanne Gangs mindset, he said: \"Its OK to sit in  and reflect that these people were psychopaths. In many ways, they were born into an era when this was sanitised. It was normal behaviour in many working class areas. I think admitting this is a great justice to the victims,\" he said.\"Without him, Im not sure a lot of families would get some semblance of truth.\"Unquiet Graves: The Story Of The Glenanne Gang premieres at The Movie House, Dublin Road, tomorrow at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"businesses near irish border making plans for hard brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, Mr Stewart revealed the Scottish Government wants to introduce a new definition of fuel poverty “which makes innovative use of the minimum income standard in order to better-align fuel poverty with relative-income poverty”.He also proposed the Government reports every five years on the policy’s progress, although convener of the Local Government and Communities Committee James Dornan argued for this to happen every three years.Mr Dornan said: “Recent statistics shows that fuel poverty affects .% of households in Scotland, with some people and families struggling to pay for their fuel bills or heat their homes to an acceptable and comfortable level.“This Bill has the potential to make a dference to the lives of many families in Scotland.“However, the real test will be whether the measures and strategies that are coming are practical, deliverable and robust.“It will be the job of this Parliament to keep a watch on this in the coming years.”Although the Bill passed at the first stage with unanimous approval, opposition MSPs urged the Scottish Government to make the legislation tougher – with Greens MSP Andy Wightman suggesting the % target could possibly be achieved by  instead of .Mr Wightman said his party would bring forward amendments to the legislation at stage two, as he told MSPs: “A  target does reflect a higher level of ambition and is preferable.“Andit cannot be achieved we will know in advance.”He said: “This Bill does represent an important part of tackling fuel poverty – but it’s not in a fit state to deliver what is required.”This should have been a far-reaching and exciting piece of legislation, but its anything but.Paul Simpson, Tory MSPFacebookTwitterScottish Conservative MSP Paul Simpson, who sits on the Local Government Committee that scrutinised the plans, described the proposals as “well meaning, but they lack ambition”.He said: “This should have been a far-reaching and exciting piece of legislation, but it’s anything but.“It can change, though. You could replace the six pages of the Bill with a six-line press release and achieve the same thing.”However, he welcomed the provisions for islands and remote parts of the country and added: “Fuel poverty rates in urban Scotland have improved since , but rates in rural areas have not.”Meanwhile Labour’s Pauline McNeill said the proposals “fall short in many areas”.She added: “It has to sound more like real ambition to prevent more people from living in cold, draughty homes.”Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said it is “essential we show more ambition in what we seek to achieve”.The Orkney MSP spoke about the higher heating bills people living in remote and island communities can face, as he argued the Bill does “not as it stands adequately take into account the additional costs associated with living in remote and rural areas of Scotland”."},{"url":null,"title":"shamima begum is not a bangladeshi citizen says foreign minister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In court and in interviews, Ghosn has insisted he is innocent and said he wants to fight the case in court.The lawyer questioned why Nissan chose to seek Ghosn’s arrest.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Junichiro Hironaka “I also found it bizarre why this became a case to start with. It feels more like an internal matter for Nissan … but somehow it was taken to the prosecutors,” he said.Nissan, based in Yokohama near Tokyo, issued a statement saying it was “not in a position to comment on judicial matters and criminal charges, which must be resolved between the prosecutors, the courts, and the defendant. Put simply, we are not in a position to comment directly or specically on Ghosn’s legal defence”.The statement reiterated Nissan’s earlier comments on such issues.Mr Hironaka said thatprosecutors have a strong case against Ghosn, they could release him pending his trial instead of keeping him on the grounds he might tamper with evidence.“These issues cannot meet international standards,” he said. “I think this case could present an opportunity to review and reform problems” in the legal system, he added.Mr Hironaka refused to sayGhosn will try for a third time to gain release on bail, noting the defence team was still working out its strategy.Ghosn hired Mr Hironaka and another new lawyer, Hiroshi Kawatsu, last week, beefing up his legal team ahead of his trial. Mr Hironaka has a strong track record for winning rare acquittals in a country where the conviction rate is %. Kawatsu is an expert on judicial reform who has studied and done research in the US.Ghosn and another Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, were arrested just after landing at Tokyo’s Haneda International Airport. Kelly was granted bail pending his trial on charges he allegedly helped Ghosn under-report millions of dollars of income.The arrests “out of the blue” could frighten others doing business in Japan, Mr Hironaka said. “Like,they come to Japan, they could face such a terrible situation, like suddenly they could be taken into the prosecutors’ custody,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"derry girls date series two announced channel","story":"The long awaited second series of Derry Girls willto our screens on March .Channel , the makers of the hugely successful comedy announced the date earlier this afternoon.TV’s can now be finally programmed to capture a recording of Episode  on Tuesday, March  at .pm.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshEarlier this week a premier of the first episode took place at the Strand Road cinema in Derry.And, a recently painted mural of the show’s main characters at Orchard Street has been attracting massive attention from far and wide.The second series of the show was announced last year just hours after the very first episode went to air."},{"url":null,"title":"loganair takes flybmis aberdeen air routes derry london next","story":"Loganair has expressed an interest in taking over the Derry to London route.The company, which already operates a flight from City of Derry Airport to Glasgow, has secured three key air routes from Aberdeen following news that Flybmi has gone into administration.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshBeginning on  March, Loganair will operate flights from Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg.An announcement as to who will operate the Derry-Stansted flight is expected in the coming days."},{"url":null,"title":"routes university levels nwrc student","story":"“I went to NWRC’s Open Day and discovered there were more routes to University than doing A-Levels” – that’s the view on one North West Regional Collegestudent who was speaking ahead of the college’s open days next week.Health Sciences student Adam Meehan says that after attending NWRC’s Open Day in , he decided studying for the Level  Extended Diploma was the best course to take to become a Paramedic.Adam, , is now in the final year of his course, and has accepted a conditional offer at the University of Portsmouth to study Paramedic Science in September .He said: “At the Open Day, I developed a whole dferent positive opinion of NWRC from what I previously heard from peers and school teachers.“This college has so much to offer, from hundreds of courses, the amazing Careers Academy, state of the art Learning Resource Centre  Library and much more.“I have loved every minute of this course, from going on hospital placements to doing interesting units.“I would highly recommend attending a NWRC open day as this gives you a great insight of what this college has to offer.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Studying at NWRC was a much better alternative than doing A-levels and this was backed up by universities I contacted.“This is a highly desirable qualication, I received five university interviews this year and have accepted a conditional offer at University of Portsmouth to study Paramedic Science and I hope to move away and start in September .”North West Regional College will hold Open Days at its main campuses in Strabane, Derry-Londonderry, and Limavady on , , and  February.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17416592.marie-jones-returns-to-the-ardhowen-a-place-of-happy-memories/resources/images/9428445.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

It is expected that this adjustment can be made within the next couple of weeks.St. John’s glebe warden Derek Swann said: “Repair work on the bell itself was indeed completed before Christmas but getting all the other elements, including weather, required for the refit proved dficult.“Specialist long reach lting equipment was hired to ease the dficult job of setting the assembled oak plinth and bell which was attached to it into position in the bell tower.Getting the bell back into position.“The Select Vestry would like to thank local land owners Ian McKee and John Blair for allowing us access onto their ground with the lting equipment.“Fundraising for the project continues, and although we have not yet reached the target amount, we have been really pleased and are very grateful with all the support and donations that we have received to date.”N.I murder victim killed by two shotgun blasts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

But, clever marketing tricks aside, it is worth emphasising that doomsday scenario shortages are not inevitable.Keep calm and dont panic buyBritainrsquos food supplies are heavily linked to trade with the EU. The latest figures from the UK government suggest that, on average, the EU supplies % of all food consumed in the UK and there is concern that customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would delay deliveries to the UK. Supermarkets rely on very frequent deliveries and hold limited reserves so there is an issue here.As Britain produces half of the food it consumes and because trade of food with the EU will hardly stop overnight on March , it is tempting to think that food shortages are nothing more than scaremongering. But the situation is slightly more complex than it initially seems. For example, while the UK does produce % of its own food, this figure is an average. For certain goods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, the actual figure is nearer to just %. This means the UK is much more dependent on fresh fruit and vegetable imports from the EU than other food stuffs.Plus, while Brexit is unlikely to stop trade with the EU, a no-deal scenario will likely result in a default to World Trade Organization rules. This means tarfs would need to be paid. To ensure compliance, food would need to be checked at the ports.Read more: J D Wetherspoon favours more UK products as we move towards BrexitA recent study by researchers at Imperial College London found that just two extra minutes spent checking each vehicle could translate to jams of up to  miles. At peak times, Kent could see nearly five hours of traffic delays. For short shelf-le foods like fruit and vegetables, this could be catastrophic.Another important consideration is the practical configuration of UK ports. A signicant proportion of the UKrsquos food imports from the EU come in through channel ports such as Dover and Felixstowe. These use ferries designed for food to be carried in trucks which use a ldquoroll-on, roll-off system at either side. Much of the UKrsquos existing international shipping, by comparison, comes in on crates which use a ldquoload-on, load-off system.The two systems are not readily interchangeable meaning that the UK could not simply ert shipping from the EU to its west coast ports to reduce inspection queues. Nor could it rapidly increase food deliveries from non-EU countries without signicant expansion work and also careful tarf negotiation to prevent the same queues occurring there too.It is therefore very likely that a no-deal Brexit scenario would result in some initial delays. Nonetheless there are ways that the UK can prepare to stop these hold ups turning into actual shortages of food:. PrioritiseWhile delays at ports are likely to be inevitable in a no-deal scenario, for certain products, like dried food and store cupboard staples that donrsquot need refrigeration, they pose no threat to the quality of the food. This means it should be possible to shortlist and streamline the process for top priority foods like fresh fruit and vegetables and meats so that they get through ahead of the queues.The employment of an extra , inspectors by HMRC in anticipation of Brexit should help facilitate this process.Hopes both London and planned new Manchester route can be saved - CoDA Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DERR | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DERR | Article Teaser\". Contingency planningResearch Irsquove carried out has shown that many of the large food retailers have decades of experience in dealing with unexpected disruptions and will have plans in place to minimise them. These include stockpiling but also the capacity to fly in goods by air freight.This last option, while expensive and still liable for tarfs, would help to temporarily reduce dependency on channel ports. So there is reason to be confident that short-term price spikes passed on to consumers are more likely than large-scale shortages.Read more: How the UK Visas and Immigration department is preparing for Brexit. Avoid panic buyingIf the current trend for Brexit boxes is anything to go by, it is likely that consumers will rush to stock up on emergency foods such as tinned goods and bottled drinks in the build-up to March , in lieu of a Brexit deal. Ironically, these products are also the least likely to suffer from a ened border check as they will not spoil. In fact, it is only panic buying that will cause any kind of disruption.It is important to remember that, ultimately, while delays are likely in the event of a no-deal Brexit, they will be temporary and only pose a risk for certain goods with a short shelf le. Some panic buying might be inevitable, but in worst case scenarios this will result in shops running out of one item but still having similar alternatives to choose from.Research by Jamie Stone, Research Associate at the Centre for Sustainable Manufacturing and Recycling Technologies , Loughborough University.

They stock many vegan vitamins and products.ldquoWindsor Fruit Stores in the Windsor Arcade are my favourites for amazing fruit and vegetables, I buy a lot of wonderful organic fruit and vegetables from them.ldquoThe owners Mike and Tricia are so helpful and always suggest things for me. Unusual fruits and veg too from time to time.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
