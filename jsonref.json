A C-SPAN producer shared a photo of the scene inside the Capitol this morning: While Joe Biden addressed the Summit for Democracy this morning, there was a brief moment of alarm over on Capitol Hill. The US Capitol Police said its officers spotted a handgun in a bag on the X-ray screen in the Longworth House Office Building at approximately 7.40am. “The man was tracked down four minutes later and arrested,” the USCP said in a statement. “The owner of the bag was identified as 57-year-old Jeffrey Allsbrooks (02-20-1964), a staffer with the House Chief Administrative Office. Allbrooks told our officers he forgot the gun was in the bag.” Allsbrooks was charged with carrying a pistol without a license, and the USCP is continuing to investigate the incident.The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (Idea) has concluded in an analysis that the total number of democracies in the world has declined from 104 to 98, just since 2015, which is what the White House and Biden are referring to as a “global democratic recession”.The US president pledged that the US is going to “lead by example”.  This is a logical and worthy point but also somewhat ironic because democracy as America knows it is gravely under threat. As the Republican party shifts further rightwards, in Congress and at state level in some places, many fear that the circumstances that lead to the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January by extremist supporters of Donald Trump, as they attempted to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory, could happen again. Reuters reported this example: And the ’s Ed Pilkington has reported several specials, including this one warning: Republicans are vying for critical positions in many states – from which they could launch a far more effective power-grab than Trump’s 2020 effort.

The preliminary data in the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed.Blood from five out of six people who had been vaccinated as well as previously infected with Covid-19 still neutralised the Omicron variant, the manuscript said.“These results are better than I expected. The more antibodies you got, the more chance you’ll be protected from Omicron,” Mr Sigal said on Twitter.He said the lab had not tested the variant against blood from people who had received a booster dose, because they are not available in South Africa yet.According to the manuscript, the lab observed a 41-fold decline in levels of neutralising antibodies against the Omicron variant.Mr Sigal said on Twitter that figure is likely to be adjusted after his lab does more experiments.‘Substantial protection’While neutralising antibodies are an indicator of the body’s immune response, scientists believe other kinds of cells such as B-cells and T-cells also are stimulated by the vaccines and help protect against the effects of the coronavirus.The preliminary data does not indicate that the vaccine is less able to prevent severe illness or death. While lab tests are under way, BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said last week: “We think it’s likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron.”The Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa last month, has triggered alarms globally of another surge in infections, with more than two dozen countries from Japan to the United States reporting cases.The World Health Organisation classified it on November 26th as a “variant of concern”, but said there was no evidence to support the need for new vaccines specifically designed to tackle the Omicron variant with its many mutations.There is not significant data yet on how vaccines from Moderna, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and other drug-makers hold up against the new variant. All the manufacturers, including Pfizer and BioNTech, are expected to release their own data within weeks. Mr Sahin told NBC News on Tuesday that BioNTech has data coming on Wednesday or Thursday related to the new variant.Less severeTop US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday that preliminary evidence indicates that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus likely has a higher degree of transmissibility but is less severe.He said the US was doing its own tests to determine the protectiveness of the current vaccines against the variant and expects results sometime next week.Umer Raffat, an analyst for Evercore ISI, cautioned against reading too much into a single study, noting there has been significant variability in measuring declines in antibody levels in previous lab studies.“Let’s wait for additional studies to draw a mosaic,” he said. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"t%C3%A1naiste apologises after people queue for hours at walk in booster clinic","story":"This time-lapse video shows the 650 metre line that formed this morning at the UCD walk-in Covid-19 vaccination centre - whose crowd size prompted the HSE to say “please do not go there as the centre is at capacity”. Video: Liam DwanThe queue outside the UCD vaccination centre on Thursday. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has apologised for the “inconvenience” faced by people who were queuing for hours at the walk-in vaccination centre at University College Dublin on Thursday morning.Mr Varadkar admitted there has been IT and teething problems with the rollout of the Covid-19 booster vaccination programme to date.His comments came after the Health Service Executive (HSE) asked members of the public not to attend either UCD or Croke Park drop-in centres early on Thursday morning, as demand for boosters quickly outstripped supply capability.Staff at UCD’s oversubscribed centre administered close to 400 doses on Thursday, far in excess of capacity levels, and encountered anger from many turned away in lengthy queues.“I just want to express my regrets and apologise on behalf of the Government and HSE for the inconvenience faced by people this morning who were queuing for their dose and weren’t able to get it,” Mr Varadkar said. “In the round, the third dose programme is going very well, over a million people in Ireland have received their third dose. I think we’re very close to the top of the league table in the European Union in terms of third doses.“We’re now in fourth place out of 27 countries, but I know that if you’re left standing in the cold waiting for a vaccine that they don’t get, that’s pretty cold comfort,” he said.“There have been IT problems and teething problems, and we will get them right just like we got them right during the first period of the vaccine programme.”The issue was raised in the Dáil on Thursday by Irish Right To Change TD Joan Collins who asked why more pharmacies and local centres could not administer booster shots.Mr Varadkar added there were about 900 pharmacies involved in the vaccination programme and it is “important that all pharmacies are given the possibility to participate”.OvercapacityAlthough the small walk-in centre at UCD, with just 10 vaccination units, has a capacity to administer about 100 jabs per hour, staff gave a total of 383 over a three-hour period, one hour longer than the planned 8am to 10am walk-in service.On Wednesday, the HSE updated its IT systems as confusion continued to dominate the booster rollout programme.A spokeswoman for the Ireland East Hospital Group said that as early as 8.15am, just 15 minutes after doors opened, about 600 people were queuing for a system that could only cope with half of that number. “They got through as many as they possibly could,” she said, adding that anyone still determined to get the vaccine could attend another unit at Kilanerin, in Gorey, Co Wexford, which is open until 5pm.The HSE has also upgraded its live information system and social media accounts to advise people on demand and capacity in real time. Anyone attending further walk-in clinics is advised to show up early and to monitor updates, she said.FrustrationOn Thursday, as it quickly became apparent many people would not be processed, some emotion spilled over. “I would say there is some frustration in the queues,” the spokeswoman said. “There has been some anger put towards the vaccination staff, and it is unfortunate because they can only do their best.”Further high demand is expected at the campus on Saturday, the next scheduled walk-in service which will run from 8am to 1pm. One frustrated attendee at Wednesday’s service told The  he had cycled 8km to the Belfield-based campus in south Dublin only to be turned away. The booster vaccine clinic offers shots to those aged 50 to 69 and all healthcare workers. At 8.40am the HSE posted on Twitter that there were “very large queueing times” at the clinic and said “please do not go there as the centre is at capacity”.Damien McCallion, the HSE’s national lead for vaccinations, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that every walk-in centre “has a certain level of capacity”.He said the HSE would provide daily updates on “where there are queues and show options”.According to the HSE’s website, there are two other walk-in clinics offering booster vaccines in Dublin on Thursday – one at the National Show Centre in Swords and another at Croke Park.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"storm barra 8 000 without electricity as esb crews restore power to thousands","story":"ESB crew removing and replacing a single phase transformer near Fassaroe, Co Wicklow, which was damaged during Storm Barra.

Much like the last-minute mask decision fiasco the Government takes no consideration of parents ability to choose what might be best for their children or give parents time to deal with the fallout from the decisions. I would hope that in future they could consider parents in their late-night decision making.‘Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all?’Kieran O’Hare DublinA ham-fisted, behind-covering, one-size-fits-all decision that has greatly inconvenienced parents and deprived children of yet another day’s valuable learning. It was nothing more than a very windy day in south central Dublin on Tuesday. It was even less inclement on Wednesday. Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all? Why not delegate the decision to school principals. They are on the ground and best placed to make a call on local conditions. What will prompt the next enforced closure? The wrong type of wind?‘This is just not acceptable’Shirley Dunne GalwayIn Galway city, Tuesday was a bit breezy Wednesday was calm and the sun was shining. There is absolutely no reason why schools in Galway city should have closed. We will have a long winter, and negative implications on our children’s education, if schools close every time there is an orange weather alert. We are both trying to work from home whilst our children are home from school, and the school did not roll out any online learning or send home any materials for the children to work on. This is just not acceptable, or sustainable long-term.I am a third-year student in NUI Galway doing exams. They were planned to be on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday but due to the college closure the Tuesday and Wednesday exams were postponed to Saturday and Sunday. This creates a very stressful period as they have been placed in the middle of other exams. I now have four exams in a row from Friday to Monday, also with exams on the following Wednesday and Thursday. Six exams in seven days is not ideal. Both Tuesday and Wednesday did not display any strong winds that would prevent such exams taking place. This is not the type of pressure my course colleagues and I want in the run up to Christmas.‘I’ve no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports’S Riordan CorkI’m a separated mother of two small children working a four-day week. Working from home (WFH) has its benefits and generally I work a hybrid model mostly. However, when the preschools \u0026amp schools are closed and I’ve no back-up, I’m actually parenting from work at my kitchen table rather than working from home. And I have no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports – mainly my elderly parents – and the housing crisis, resulting in ever increasing rents, keeps pushing me further and further away from the city where my friends and family live. I do not live long enough in one place to make lasting friendships with neighbours that I could approach for help. My childminder is wonderful, but I pay her €70full day when I earn €95 net. I borrow to work the school summer holidays, I cannot afford any unplanned or unexpected curveballs like these last two days of red weather alerts and school closures. And with end-of-year deadlines, calling in sick is not an option. My workload would only be waiting for my return. Furthermore, I worry about the lasting developmental damage this frequent ‘WFH’ is forcing upon my young children. Both have been sick a lot lately and I cannot send them to school with even a snivel anymore. When they are sick I can no longer take time off to mind them because I am now able to ‘WFH’. So the frequency of this scenario of me at the kitchen table on the laptop ignoring them has increased.When there are two parents, they can help one another, give each other a break. I on the other hand, cannot even go to the shop for milk without packing us all out the door! Lets not forget that we’ve had long runs of school closures in the very recent past in this pandemic. And, in isolation these two days of red weather alerts and school closures would be manageable. However, within the context of this pandemic, a housing crisis and only the beginning of a long winter, it feels like the last straw.‘At 11pm we got the email the creche would close’Mrunal Kotkunde Dublin 16I was okay and scheduled all meetings to next day as I have toddler at home and it was difficult to work with him around. On Tuesday, weather was not bad in Dublin 16 and I thought the decision to close schools and crèches were uncalled for. They should have access the severity and took the decision only on affected areas and not generalised the decision. We got an email from the creche that on Wednesday it would be be open but at 11pm at night got the email that it was closed due to Government decision. Weather was not bad at all, as I have seen much worse weather than these two days. Has the crèche refunded us two days’ fees?We have already had enough stress due to Covid-19.‘Probably the right decision at the time’Kevin Connolly CorkIn our area of east Cork, the storm, thankfully, didn’t hit us as hard as other parts of the county or other counties. The decision to close the schools for the second day proved to be unnecessary in our part of the county, but it was probably the right decision at the time, and was no doubt influenced by poorer conditions in the west of the county. The decision was made in good time, 5.30pm and it was flagged for a few hours before the official decision was made.There was strong wind here for a couple of days. Nothing to worry about, yet two children home from school. Complete nonsense. Children packed into Mcdonald’s yesterday, and packed into indoor play centre today. It was NOT dangerous to go out. Stupid decision.I’m astounded at why the schools were closed when they have had ample opportunity over the past two years to operate online. It reinforces that those accountable for education in our country are not of a proactive or progressive mindset and take the easy option. Very disappointing.‘Conditions were not dangerous’Dermot Maguire DublinI am at a loss to understand why the schools in Dublin were closed. Conditions were not dangerous, it was indeed cold, wet and miserable, but it was also the same in December when I went to school 35 years ago. However, we just went to school and got on with it. Children have missed more school over the past two years due to the pandemic, on top of already the ridiculous amount of holidays for teachers, course days, etc. Of course, the decision to close schools was the one decision over the past number of years that the teacher unions accepted without question. I fear for the education of our children and their mental health.I had not been advised by the preschool so on Tuesday I turned up to it and realised it was closed. I had hectic days trying to do basic things as I live alone with a toddler. The school closures have disrupted my days but finally it’s over.‘These decisions should be taken lightly’John Lalor DublinThe weather didn’t seem severe enough to justify the closure, in Dublin at least. Children have missed some much school time with Covid closures that these decisions should not be taken lightly. Additionally, most working parents had to take two days’ annual leave or lose two days’ pay to mind their kids at short notice. Obviously this isn’t the case in the Department of Education but decision-makers should be mindful of the impact on private sector workers.‘I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather’Anne Cassidy DublinI would not have sent my kids on Wednesday even if the Government had not closed schools. The weather warning finished at 7am. We leave the house at that time so I had already decided to do the safest thing for my children and work from home. I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather or the Government and I’m happy to blame the Government for a lot. I’m not sure sure I’d want to be a principal having to deal with that last night, but as a parent kids’ safety overrides my inconvenience. Even if in your particular area it seemed fine we all travel to work think how much more dangerous it would have been with school traffic and fallen branches.‘Is this to be the new norm?’Paul Richardson BrayIreland is an island. Consequently, the weather is regularly wet and windy. In Bray today it is merely breezy and a status yellow warning has been applied. But somehow the local environs are deemed unsafe for school commutes. If navigating your way past fallen leaves and the occasional puddle is challenging, then the decision to close schools for a second day was indeed a wise one. If on the other hand, you consider the inclement weather to be a regular feature of life in this country, then the school closures are perplexing to say the least. Is this to be the new norm – school closures on the basis of oft-cited, but rarely challenged, health and safety concerns?‘We don’t have a family to help in Ireland’Jonas Rall DublinIn Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, the storm was mild, with only leaves and bins being affected. My son, that is two years old, goes to a creche that closed Tuesday and Wednesday, with such short notice that I couldn’t make any arrangements. We don’t have a family to help in Ireland. This put massive stress over my partner and me to take the day off on Tuesday, move meetings and customers to the following days, only to be warned at 11pm on Tuesday that Wednesday would also have the creche closed. I found it unfair as I can see that the storm is not affecting my region, and I pay a hefty amount to the creche to help me take care of him so we can work. Moreover, it was clear in the note that the orange warning was only up to 7 am, with the first employees arriving close to 8.30am, they could definitely work on Wednesday.

Most sectors are doing extremely well, but there are some sectors that are hit really hard.”He said there are two economies in Ireland, sectors that are affected and those that are unaffected by Covid-19.He said the number of people on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) had fallen to 54,824 at the end of November, the lowest level to date. Mr Varadkar said 5,452 potential redundancies were notified in 2019, 12,514 in 2020 and 7,500 to date this year.Restrictions scepticismThe Tánaiste also said that he will maintain a “healthy scepticism” around additional Covid-19 restrictions as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.“I hate to see any business being closed or being restricted. As Minister for Employment, I really hate to see anyone being laid off, especially for the second or third time,” he said.“As a politician who believes in personal freedom and liberty, I hate to see people’s inidual freedoms, our family life being restricted by governments in any way, but sometimes it is necessary.“Anytime we impose restrictions on people and on business, I think we need to ask questions – where’s the evidence, will this work, are there alternatives? I feel that’s my responsibility and I will continue to do so, particularly if further restrictions are proposed in the weeks ahead.”Mr Varadkar said restrictions announced last Friday were a “bitter pill and a deep disappointment to all of us”.“They were a body blow in particular for sectors like hospitality, the arts, events, entertainment and leisure, which rely on December to see them through other parts of the year,” he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"developed nations have a moral duty to waive patents on vaccines","story":"The satirist James Gillray channelled  popular anxieties about vaccination  in his 1802 cartoon The Cow Pock–or–the Wonderful Effects of the New Inoculation! At the centre, Edward Jenner is seen delivering a  vicious gouge to a woman’s arm with his lancet as all around her the previous vaccine recipients undergo horrible transformations. As I write this month’s column, coronavirus cases are once again on the rise. The seven-day rolling average of infections has climbed above 5,000 in the State for the first time since January. The Omicron variant saw the European Union recommend the suspension of travel to and from several southern African countries where it has become prominent, despite being discovered independently in several European countries with no demonstrable link to southern Africa.This is a reminder of our privileged position in the global north, with a surplus of vaccines available. As we roll out the third wave of booster jabs, countries such as South Africa, which led calls for a patent waiver to speed up vaccine production, have been able to vaccinate only 28 per cent of their population. Elsewhere in the region, that percentage often drops to single figures.Of course, this winter coronavirus is not the only respiratory virus that we will be vaccinating against. This is traditionally flu season in the northern hemisphere.In the southern hemisphere, however, winter has just ended. One interesting finding from Australia is that vaccination, alongside social distancing and similar restrictions to combat coronavirus spread, has had a dramatic effect on flu cases.In July two people died of flu in Australia, the first in more than a year. The five-year average for Australian flu deaths is 404. There were just 21,266 flu cases confirmed by Australian laboratories this season, compared to an average of 113,861 in the previous five years.Airborne diseasePublic health measures have been so effective in restricting airborne disease transmission that there have been no confirmed cases of two of the four major strains of flu anywhere in the world for more than 18 months. There are two families of the flu virus, influenzas A and B. Influenza A is ided into subtypes based on their surface proteins (H1N1 and H3N2) which are then ided into clades. Influenza B is ided into two lineages, Victoria and Yamagata. An entire clade of H3N2 (3c3.A) was last detected in March 2020, while no cases of BYamagata have been confirmed since last April.It may be too soon to declare these strains extinct, but the reduction in their prevalence is certainly remarkable. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has only ever declared two diseases extinct: the cattle disease rinderpest, and one human disease, smallpox. Both were the result of massive vaccination drives and global campaigning.In 1796 Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine by taking material from cowpox lesions on a cow maid (vaccine comes from vaccus, the Latin for cow) and injecting it into an eight-year-old boy. Several weeks later, he injected the boy with live smallpox, with no ensuing infection.InoculationThis approach would not receive ethical approval today, but it did demonstrate that cowpox could protect against smallpox and offered an alternative to the more dangerous method of inoculation, originating in China, by exposure to a mild version of smallpox.By the late 19th century, vaccination meant Ireland was recording only a handful of smallpox deaths each year. In the early 1870s a smallpox pandemic killed about 4,000 people here. England, with about four times the population, recorded more than 40,000 smallpox deaths in the same period. Other countries with less stringent vaccination regimes were even more badly affected and saw double or treble those rates.Tropical countriesThe technical and sanitary challenges posed by using a culture drawn from animal samples and stored in glycerol meant that vaccination was particularly difficult in tropical countries.However, in the 1950s, Leslie Collier at the Lister Institute developed a freeze-dried vaccine. In the following decade, Benjamin Rubin of Wyeth Laboratories designed the bifurcated needle, which allowed for reliable and cheap vaccination using the Lister vaccine with minimal training.These developments, and the decision to waive patents and royalties on the needle and vaccine, enabled the WHO to launch its 1966-1977 campaign to eradicate smallpox globally.Coming shortly after a failed effort to eradicate malaria, the team led by Donald Henderson had to overcome scepticism that eradication was possible. But after 14 years of careful searching and contact tracing, millions of vaccines delivered using a “ring” approach to target resources effectively, and $300 million, smallpox was finally declared eradicated in 1980.The news that public health measures have a significant impact on respiratory virus spread is very welcome, but the lesson from history is that developed nations have a moral duty and practical rationale for waiving patents to vaccinate more quickly the global south. \u0026nbspEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"new zealand to ban smoking for next generation in bid to outlaw habit by 2025","story":"The New Zealand government has announced it plans to ban young people from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime in one of the world\u0027s toughest crackdowns on the tobacco industry. Video: ReutersAssociate health minister Dr Ayesha Verrall: ‘This is a historic day for the health of our people.’ Photograph: iStockNew Zealand has announced it will outlaw smoking for the next generation, so that those who are aged 14 and under today will never be legally able to buy tobacco.New legislation means the legal smoking age will increase every year, to create a smoke-free generation of New Zealanders, associate health minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said on Thursday.“This is a historic day for the health of our people,” she said.The New Zealand government announced the rising age alongside other measures to make smoking unaffordable and inaccessible, to try to reach its goal of making the country entirely smoke-free within the next four years. Other measures include reducing the legal amount of nicotine in tobacco products to very low levels, cutting down the shops where cigarettes could legally be sold and increasing funding to addiction services. The new laws will not restrict vape sales.“We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth. People aged 14 when the law comes into effect will never be able to legally purchase tobacco,” Dr Verrall said.New Zealand’s daily smoking rates have been dropping over time – down to 11.6 per cent in 2018, from 18 per cent a decade earlier. But smoking rates for Maori and Pasifika were far higher – 29 per cent for Maori and 18 per cent for Pasifika. “If nothing changes, it would be decades till Maori smoking rates fall below 5 per cent,” Dr Verrall said.The policies were welcomed by public health experts on Thursday. “New Zealand once again leads the world, this time with a cutting-edge smoke-free 2025 implementation plan – it’s truly a game-changer,” said Dr Natalie Walker, director of the Centre for Addiction Research at University of Auckland. The reduction of nicotine in cigarettes was a world first, said public health professor Chris Bullen. From a health perspective, “all my wishes have come true”, he said.ChallengesSmoking has already been widely replaced by vaping among teenage New Zealanders, and vaping is also attracting many young people who would never have taken up smoking. According to a survey of 19,000 high school students this year, nearly 20 per cent were vaping daily or several times a day, the majority with high nicotine doses. That’s compared to 3 per cent of those aged 15-17 who smoked daily in 2018, or 13 per cent who smoked a decade earlier.The plan has come under criticism from some parties – the Act party has argued that reducing the nicotine in products will hit lower-income people hardest, who will have to buy more cigarettes and smoke more to access the same dose. Dr Verrall said the very low levels required by the laws had been researched and proven to help people quit.Concerns have also been raised about a growing black market for tobacco. The government acknowledged this risk in initial proposals: “Evidence indicates that the amount of tobacco products being smuggled into New Zealand has increased substantially in recent years and organised criminal groups are involved in large-scale smuggling,” it said.Initial plans for a smoke-free generation of New Zealanders have now been finalised after public consultation. They were first floated in April. They will still need to pass through the legislative process, but should not face any obstacles – Smokefree 2025 is a headline Labour policy, and the party holds a majority in New Zealand parliament. Dr Verrall said the legislation would be introduced in 2022, with the age limits coming in in 2023. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Minority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragedies"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street party investigation widened to include two more alleged gatherings","story":"UK prime minister Boris Johnson gestures while speaking at a press conference in Downing Street on Wednesday when he reintroduced some coronavirus restrictions.

In a large, rural county there are many people who own horses and hack across the bridleways and countryside in places that may not easily be accessible by a vehicle.“We have asked them to volunteer as a Neighbourhood Watch on horseback and report back on any unusual activity they see. Typically, riders will be looking out for any signs of wildlife crime such as poaching or raptor persecution, general theft of livestock, feed or fertiliser and particularly heritage crimes.”“We are also training those who want to be tack stamp trained or stamping tack as required to help protect items that could be stolen.”Mark Harrison, the head of heritage crime strategy for Historic England, added: “We’re delighted to support Wiltshire Police’s Heritage Watch scheme, which raises awareness and understanding of the threats posed by crime and anti-social behaviour to our heritage.“Through Heritage Watch partnerships, we can better prevent crime and hold offenders to account. The Horse Rider Volunteer Scheme is a great innovation as part of Wiltshire’s Heritage Watch scheme.“People have lived and worked in Wiltshire for thousands of years and during this time, our ancestors have left us with an amazing legacy that we can see in the form of historic buildings, sites and features in the landscape.“Unfortunately, a small criminal minority are responsible for causing damage or loss to this precious and finite resource.

There have also been four confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland, three in Co Monaghan and one in Co Cavan, and 57 cases in wild birds across nine counties.There are two confirmed cases of avian influenza in Northern Ireland.Some 22,100 ducks were culled at one of the affected sites, a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone is also being applied to the second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a small backyard flock.The flock owners are to receive compensation for the lost livestock. A valuation at the Aughnacloy site has been described as ongoing.An avian influenza prevention zone was put in place across Northern Ireland on November 17 and a mandatory housing order came into effect on November 29.Jim Blee, from the Department of Agriculture, described the cull in Aughnacloy as having been completed on Wednesday night, and paid tribute to staff who carried out the very difficult work across four to five days, and through Storm Barra.Appearing before the Stormont agriculture committee on Thursday morning, Mr Blee, deputy director of the animal health and welfare ision, said Great Britain is on day 44 of the outbreak, and there have been 38 cases confirmed in Britain since the first confirmed case in England on October 26.This is now the largest ever outbreak of avian influenza on these islands, he told MLAs.In Northern Ireland Mr Blee said there are two confirmed cases as of Thursday, and nine cases in wild birds.We have been working closely with colleagues across Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland as this outbreak develops, this has included daily stock take calls across the UK and close collaboration with colleagues in the devolved administrations on their approach to this outbreak, he said.We have had frequent engagement with our colleagues in the Republic of Ireland, particularly where disease control zones from an infected premise in our respective jurisdictions have extended into the other.Julian Henderson, senior principal veterinary officer, said resources are a real issue right across the British Isles.The official said avian flu is likely to be with us across the winter and urged people to be extremely vigilant and not stop being vigilant until it warms up in the spring time.A statement posted to the Royal Parks website said: During the current national outbreak of avian influenza, we have been advised by the Animal and Plant Health Agency to move the pelicans of St James’s Park to their enclosure on Duck Island as a precaution. We want to reassure the public that all six pelicans are healthy, and we hope that they will be back out and about preening themselves by the lake, soon. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Three Christmas parties to be investigated as pressure grows on Boris JohnsonIn charts: Why ministers think we could hit a million omicron cases a day by ChristmasCovid latest news: Working from the office less of a coronavirus risk than shopping, UCL saysThe Government has broken its side of the bargain HS2 route map: how the high-speed rail plans will affect youBoris Johnson accused of lying over flat refurbishment as Tories landed with fineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid plan b explained what","story":"Covid Plan B explained: What you can and cant do under new rules for EnglandBoris Johnson tonight announced England’s Plan B for Covid as the Omicron iant surges.

Experts warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.People are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in more settings from Friday, produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday, and may get daily contact testing instead of isolation.It’s what the PM hoped not to do. He hoped he would not have to review restrictions until next week in time for their expiry on December .Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,.  England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty added: “We know that it looked asit was going to evade vaccination. And now, clinically, we know that it can.” Yet Mr Javid was booed in the Commons as he introduced the work-from-home order - which has left Tory MPs furious. Tory MP William Wragg said vaccine passports “will create a segregated society” - and accused the PM of a dead cat to distract from the No party. “Very few will be convinced by this ersionary tactic”, he swiped. So what can and can’t you do  Here’s the full rundown of new rules. Mandatory vaccine passports for venues Under Plan B, certain venues will be forced to ask punters for an NHS Covid pass. Under previous plans only the vaccine part would be valid. People would no longer be able to show a negative test.But today Boris Johnson announced he is putting this plan into action from am on Wednesday  December - with a key change.Contrary to previous plans, he said “a negative lateral flow test will also be sufficient” to get you into a nightclub evenyou aren’t double-jabbed.  People who haven’t had the boosterwill still be eligible for now - but Mr Johnson said “we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out.” It’s thought venues affected will be all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. They also include:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions. Outdoor, crowded settings with , or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as outdoor festivals. Any settings with , or more attendees, such as large sports and music stadia. Working from home Under plan B the government “would consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”, according to the September document. Today Boris Johnson announced that policy. He said: “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home. “From Monday you should work from homeyou can. Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.” The winter plan admitted: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions.” But SAGE had warned it would be a key way of getting cases down. Mandatory face masks  Face masks have already been mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices since am on November . They are also compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Tonight Boris Johnson announced they will be extended to “most public indoor venues including theatres and cinemas” too from .am this Friday. There will be exemptions for eating, drinking, exercising, and singing. For that reason, hospitality venues - including pubs and restaurants - will be completely exempt. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. Daily contact testing New rules say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days. But that could cause a pingdemiccases surge to a million in total by the end of the month, as Sajid Javid warned they could. Therefore Boris Johnson said the government will introduce daily tests for contacts instead of isolation. He did not say when. Face masks in schools At the end of November, secondary schools in England were recommended to ask pupils to wear masks in communal areas and corridors. There are reports of talks ongoing about whether to extend this. However there was no immediate announcement. New foreign travel rules Since November , all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world have had to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Since yesterdaythey have also had to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight back to the UK. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Eleven countries were also added to England’s red list, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. They include South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Boris Johnson did not announce any extension to this tonight. ‘Clear communications’ This is where Plan B gets vaguer. The Winter Plan said the government would ensure it “communicates clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously.” Boris Johnson today gave some of that messaging as ministers warned of the rapid doubling time of the virus. When will Plan B end  The measures announced today will be reviewed on January  and the government will update Parliament. Regulations will then “sunset” on January , Sajid Javid told MPs. But both of these days could be brought forward or pushed back so they’re not actually massively relevant. Don’t forget the original lockdown was only for three weeks. We can glean some information from the criteria for triggering Plan B in the first place. Key questions the government would ask include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions.The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital.Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme.The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Could it go further  Yes. Boris Johnson has refused to rule out lockdown measures at Christmas - or, as some scientists fear is more likely, in January when Omicron surges. Some have warned the Plan B measures above are pretty minimal overall. In particular,cases rise too high, you might need much stricter measures to actually bring cases down, rather than keep them stable or rising more slowly. The Plan B document in September said: “While the Government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees. “The Government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSPlan BBoris JohnsonEducationHospitalsPublic transportShopping centresSecondary schoolThe economyPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Office snogging and groping while we were meant to social distance, and now banned Christmas parties.We’ve known for some time that when it comes to ­lockdown and Covid, it’s one rule for us and another for them. Time and time again the Government has shown complete disregard for their own rules and utter contempt for the public. Their mantra is do as we say not as we do.And now, we know not only did they break their own rules, they were laughing their heads off at us while they were doing it.Through the excellent reporting of Daily Mirror Political Editor Pippa Crerar, we learned that last year there was a Christmas party at No Downing Street.From the very place we were given orders about what to do and how to behave, No staff were having a jolly knees-up with cheese and wine and Secret Santa.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  All this while families across the country were unable to say proper goodbyes to their dying loved ones, and people couldn’t see their ­families because of Covid restrictions – by that point I hadn’t seen my own family for several months. A few days earlier, while children faced a Christmas under lockdown rules, staff at the Department for Education got together for a party with “drinks and canapes”. Not even Armando Iannucci could have come up with something as ­unimaginable as this in a ­plotline for political spoof The Thick of It. On Tuesday, a leaked video emerged of Downing Street aides laughing and joking about a rule-breaking Christmas party with one saying the “fictional” party was a “business meeting”. The country is fuming. We are being taken for absolute mugs. We know it, they know it, heck, even Ant and Dec know it. The behaviour of people who are supposed to be in charge is an absolute insult to everyone who made sacrices and followed the rules. Leadership is about being an example to others, sacrice, and putting other people before yourself. Just ask the Queen, who at , sat alone in church to bury Prince Philip, her husband of more than  years.It’s a disgrace. I’d like to think there will be consequences, but there won’t. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Boris announced some sort of “investigation”. Once again they’re marking their own homework.Johnson’s spokeswoman Allegra Stratton has resigned and a few people may be fired, but now it just feels like they’re moving the ­deckchairs on the Titanic.People will not forget this in a hurry. Let’s see who’s laughing come the next election. Find lost kids living in pain Like Susanna Reid on GMB this week, I was moved to tears listening to the grandmother of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes talk about how her attempts to save the little boy were ignored. She said: “Something is broken in this system and something needs fixing.”  I have a son the same age as Arthur and I just can’t imagine how anyone, let alone his own father and stepmother, could be so wicked and cruel. Hearing how he suffered is heartbreaking. According to schools inspector Ofsted, there are thousands of so-called “ghost children” who have vanished from the UK education system.  Something must be done immediately to ensure they aren’t in harm’s way. If that means a massive recruitment drive for more social workers then so be it. This can never be allowed to happen again.

You are all very carefully socially distanced... we have moved, I am pleased to tell you, from the metric back to the imperial system: I notice you are all at least two inches away from each other which is, as I understand it, what the regulations require. No aide Allegra Stratton resigned yesterday over a leaked video showing Downing Street staff laughing and joking about how to describe the controversial event to journalists. The footage, obtained by ITV, was said to have been filmed the week after the party took place on  December.Mr Johnson finally apologised unreservedly for the party - after the Government repeatedly denied the Mirroraposs report that an event had occurred while the country was under strict Covid curbs. But the PM continued to deny all responsibility and say he had been told rules were followed. Downing Street aide Ed Oldfield, who took part in the mock press conference with Ms Stratton, refused to answer questions on Wednesday when doorstepped by journalists. Labouraposs Thangam Debbonaire accused Mr Rees-Mogg of treating the row as a bit of a joke - and asked why Ms Stratton was being asked to walk the plank. The Shadow Commons leader said: Judging by his comments as I saw on a video at a dinner earlier this week, it does rather seem that he also thinks it has all been a bit of a joke. After British people followed the rules and made their sacrices... yes the PMaposs staff laughed about covering up their Christmas party but he also seems to think that itaposs funny. She demanded to know why Mr Rees-Mogg didnapost follow Ms Strattonaposs example. Ms Debbonaire said: Would he also agree that it really is a very bad look indeed for a group of male politicians to let a female staffer take the rap for the mess   She laughed, he laughed. Sheaposs apologised and resigned. Whataposs he going to do  Mr Rees-Mogg said the Cabinet Secretary had been tasked with investigating alleged events in Downing Street last year - and defended his joke. He replied: As regards what I said at the IEA , what I was saying was how nice it was to be free of restrictions so that we can have parties this year. That was what I was being pleased about, as opposed, in comparison to last year. And this has got better because of what the Government has done. He also paid tribute to Ms Stratton and said she has left with great dignity. Labour MP Richard Burgon said: The Prime Ministeraposs former spokesperson has resigned after being caught on video laughing and joking about a rule-breaking Downing Street party. The Leader of the House also this week has been caught on video laughing and joking about rule-breaking whilst giving a speech at a lectern. She resigned. Surely the Leader of the House should resign too, or isnapost it another case of ministers in this Government believing itaposs one rule for them and another rule for everyone   Mr Rees-Mogg replied: Iaposm not sure heaposd like to come to the Institute of Economic Affairs, it talks too much sense for him possibly to be able to cope with it. But heaposd be very welcome to come to their future events and see what goes on and how nice it is, which I was celebrating, that weaposre back together having parties without restrictions. That is something that is extremely welcome.

The Health Secretary said “I hope not” to introduce even more rules to crack down on the surge of the more transmissible iant. But he was unable to give a guarantee. It comes after he smashed his own previous review date for restrictions and brought in two sets of rules less than a fortnight apart.People in England are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in cinemas and theatres from Friday, and must produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday.Face masks were already required in shops and on public transport and there were new rules on inbound travellers to the UK. Read More All the measures will now be reviewed on January , meaning they will be in place over Christmas. But scientists have raised doubts over what will happen after the New Year.SAGE member Prof Neil Ferguson said yesterday, before the launch of Plan B: “At the moment itaposs very dficult to rule out anything we really havenapost got a good enough handle on the threat.If the consensus is itaposs highly likely that the NHS is going to be overwhelmed then it will be for the Government to decide what it wants to do about that but itaposs a dficult situation to be in of course. Itcertainly might be possible at the current time. SAGE papers released last night warned the number of hospitalisations from Omicron may reach “, per day or higher” in England by January . It is currently just over . SAGE added: “The peak is highly likely to be higher than , to , Omicron hospital admissions per day without intervention.” Prof Paul Hunter, epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia, said he was pessimistic the strategy would work to curb infections. Advice to the government has warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,. Asked by Sky NewsEngland was looking at more restrictions in January, Mr Javid replied: “No - I hope not.” He added: “I think the action we’ve taken now is very decisive, I think it’s going to make a big dference it’s not something anyone would do lightly. “It will have a real impact on people, be dficult for many people. But I hope people would understand it’s better to take this action now than see the rate spread and increase.” The Health Secretary said modelling indicated there could be one million UK Omicron cases by the turn of the new yearrestrictions were not re-introduced.Mr Javid said the deployment of Plan B was to buy time to assess the new coronavirus iant and to build our protective defences. NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson - who represents hospital bosses - told ITV ’s Peston: “Weaposre now looking at months - three, four, five months - where weaposre under really, really relentless pressure right the way across the piece.“And thataposs as you were saying with about , hospitalised Covid patients. “Clearlywe see those numbers signicantly increase, one problem is that itaposs potentially going to be in early to mid January which is the point at which the NHS is always under greatest pressure. “And we know also weaposve got massive, massive workforce pressures at the moment, in terms of weaposve got a very very tired workforce.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSUniversity of East AngliaNew YearPlan BPaul HunterHospitalsPublic transportPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So where’s MY choice It is estimated by a charity that , children have long CovidImage: Getty Images iStockphotoopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Dec | commentsAt first it seemed sensible. Then insulting. Now  Scandalously negligent. Primary school age children in this country currently have the highest infection rates they’ve ever had during the pandemic - but there are no plans to start vaccinating them. Nearly five million - year olds have been jabbed in America, on Sunday the scheme was approved in Australia, and the rollout is expected to start next week in some European countries after it was given the green light by the European Medicines Agency. But here, nothing.Some parents won’t want their kids to be vaccinated of course, and that’s their choice - but I do, desperately. So where’s MY choice I’d take my seven-year-old to a back street illegal vaccinatorsuch a thing existed, but unfortunately it doesn’t.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Omicron is only just getting started, and already a whopping , kids tested positive for covid last week, with actual infection levels estimated to be up to four times higher than that. Charity Long Covid Kids reports that , children currently have long covid - , of whom have been suffering with it for over a year.Respected epidemiologist and public health researcher Deepti Gurdasani puts it simply, “Infection of children with SARS-Cov- will be one of those actions we look back at in history and wonder how on earth it was allowed to happen - by those who should’ve been protecting them.” I’ve gratefully accepted every vaccine my son has been offered, starting when he was eight weeks old. I’m lucky to live in a country where they’re available as standard, for free. And I believe it’s my duty to ensure he’s up to date with them, in accordance with the No part of parenting: trying to keep your kid safe. Also of course in this case, where coronavirus is still circulating, jabbing everyone means the whole community is protected. It’s better for everyone. The news about Omicron is becoming ever more concerning, and there were already upwards of , Covid cases a day before it reared its unwelcome head. And yet, every morning, I deliver my son into an environment where he mixes freely with hundreds of others, with no mitigations. No masks, no bubbles, no ventilation. And no vaccine either. Best of British luck, eh, kid  Vaccinating children was approved in the US at the end of October. Prof Jon Levy, chairman of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston University, welcomed the news: “Every paediatrician I know is eager to get their own kids age - vaccinated immediately. “They plan to get as many kids vaccinated in their offices as quickly as possible. If that doesn’t tell you how safe and effective the vaccine is. I don’t know what will.” If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation know something we don’t – and have good reason why they’re dragging their feet on protecting the smallest, most helpless people in our communities – they need to speak up. Otherwise, they’re forcing us to fail our children.

Boris Johnson last night announced plans to replace the requirement - brought in on November  - with daily lateral flow tests.Now it is believed the government is aiming to bring in the change before the Christmas break. Further details of the policy and timings are due to be set out in the coming days. The timing will come as a relief to families who feared a fresh pingdemic of isolation ruining Christmas gatherings. Expert advisors to the government have suggested there could be a million Omicron iant cases in total in the UK by January .  People will be asked to take at-home lateral flow tests and report their results truthfully themselves, as now. It comes after the PM announced the introduction of Covid plan B measures, which include working from homepossible and wearing masks in more public places. From Friday, masks will be mandatory in most indoor public places including cinemas and theatres. People will be told to work from homethey can from Monday, and from December  spectators will have to offer proof of vaccination or a negative test to attend large events. An expected review of restrictions next week will no longer happen - as the PM rushed to announce plan B measures last night. Some critics have raised questions about the timing of the move, which came as he faced intense pressure over allegations of rule-breaking parties in Downing Street. All the domestic restrictions for England will now be reviewed on January , with a sunset clause on January . Travel testing rules - which say arrivals must take a pre-departure test and get a PCR test on arrival - will still be reviewed by January . The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said Boris Johnson would not hesitate to remove measuresthe data showed the situation had improved. He said: The PMaposs message to all MPs would be the very moment we get any information on characteristics that change that picture for the better then we would, of course, act and remove at the very earliest possible opportunity.

The further damaging details emerged as Labour urged police to open an investigation into allegations No  staff broke coronavirus rules with a Christmas party in Downing Street last year, saying it was “implausible” for Scotland Yard to suggest there is insufficient evidence.Itaposs understood the event was held by Mr Baileyaposs campaign team, who were working in the basement at the time. A Tory spokesman said: “Senior CCHQstaff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of Matthew Parker Street organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of December . “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign”. As the Prime Minister announced Plan B restrictions to slow the spread of Omicron, he confirmed a Whitehall probe would be held into a party held on December , and any evidence of rule-breaking would be available to any police investigation. The Whitehall probe will focus on the bash at which officials had drinks, nibbles and party games, including a Secret Santa, late into the night. The PM on Wednesday finally apologised unreservedly over a No Christmas party - but denied all responsibility, continued to claim he was told rules were followed, and threw his own staff under the bus. Mr Johnson said he was sickened and furious at a clip of his own staff laughing about a Christmas bash four days after it happened last December, when lockdown rules banned social gatherings. Mr Johnson faced calls to extend the investigation to include a leaving do on November , . It is claimed Mr Johnson gave a speech and his former senior aide Lord Lister was thereAnd he was also asked about claims, which he denied, from Dominic Cummings that there was a smaller gathering in the Downing Street flat Mr Johnson shares with we Carrie.Sources told the Mirror that senior No  aides “were all drinking their socks off” at the alleged gathering on November  last year. Downing Street staff reported hearing “loud music pumping out of the flat” late into the night after Mr Cummings, the PM’s former top aide, had walked out of No . A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson dismissed the claims as “total nonsense”. The Department for Education’s top official announced that Gavin Williamson’s staff party in the run-up to last Christmas will also be investigated by the Cabinet Secretary. No also faces questions over a report by the BBC into a Christmas quiz that took place in person at the Cabinet Office with No staff joining in.Mr Johnson said he had asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to look at allegations relating to December , rather than at any other dates. Any aides found guilty of breaking the rules would face disciplinary action. One of the PM’s most senior aides Allegra Stratton tearfully quit after leaked footage showed her laughing and joking about a Christmas party and Covid rules while the rest of the country faced restrictions. Mr Johnson claimed he was “furious” about the leaked footage of Ms Stratton. The politan Police acknowledged it had received “a signicant amount of correspondence” relating to the alleged breaches in No  in the run up to Christmas last year but said they do not “provide evidence of a breach” of Covid rules. “Based on the absence of evidence and in line with our policy not to investigate retrospective breaches of such regulations, the Met will not commence an investigation at this time,” it added. But the force did leave open the possibility of further inquiries by saying it would consider “any evidence” that emerges in the Case inquiry. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said the Met should be “knocking on doors, taking statements and investigating people in No  in the way they would my constituents or anyone  in the country”. “It seems implausible for the politan Police to argue there is no evidence that parties took place,” he told reporters. “They’ve got to pursue this investigation without fear or favour and treat the Prime Minister and his staff as they would treat anyone . It can’t be one rule for the Prime Minister and another for everyone .” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyShaun BaileyBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

News.au reports the erotic video showed the teacher performing a striptease until she was wearing only her underwear. Then she rolled around on the floor and on her bed while touching herself. But Viktoriaaposs saucy content ended up being viewed by some of the wrong people, including parents of her pupils. An offended mother of one of her Russian language and literature students complained to the school after seeing the video online. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Viktoria claims she was asked to leave her job shortly after the complaint was received. The concerned mum reportedly wrote: “Please do not post such explicit videos, or close . She added: “My daughter watches this and you are clearly gaining kudos – but not as a teacher. Viktoria, who only qualied as a teacher recently, claims she offered to block the student in question so she wouldnapost see the racy clip, and has insisted sheaposs done nothing wrong by posting the video in the first place. Speaking to Komsomolskaya Pravda, she said: “I have been pole dancing for several years and dreamt of making a video for a long time. She added the video was, obviously, not made and posted for the students, so when the concerned mum got in touch and demanded she remove the video, Viktoria decided to block both her and her daughter. However, she claimed it was already too late to salvage her reputation as a teacher - as shortly after the exchange she was contacted by the schoolaposs director who demanded she delete the video. By now, Viktoria described the video as spreading like wildfire among the parents. As the clip blew up and was shared around the parents, and students, in the school, the teacher claims her bosses decided to sack her, alleging she was told the content was against the schoolaposs moral principles. She said: “If you want to prove yourself , we have the right not to follow this path. This is an excellent occasion to convey to all parents the moral principles that we adhere to.” Although she claims to have been told she was dismissed, Viktoria has received no further notice about when her contract will be terminated and is currently still teaching classes online. However,and when the dismissal goes ahead, she has vowed to fight it, arguing she wasnapost told about any restrictions on her social media accounts when she was offered the teaching job.

Anthony Nolan’s struggle with deadly Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome and his mum Shirley’s tireless campaign to save him by finding a suitable bone marrow donor moved the world. Shirley established the world’s first register of volunteer donors here in the UK. Tragically, she never did find a suitable match for Anthony and he died when he was seven years old. But the register became his legacy, recruiting donors around the world. Their bone marrow and stem cells have saved more than , patients with leukaemia and other blood disorders. Alan Corby spent six months in the next isolation room to Anthony at Westminster Children’s Hospital. Neither were expected to survive. Alan said: “Much of the time he was the only person I could see. We would talk and play card games like Twist through the glass. “When I was well enough I moved to my local hospital. I went back to see Anthony a few months later, but he had passed away.  “His le may have been short, but it had an incredible impact. Thousands have been given a second chance of le thanks to him and his mum.” On what would have been Anthony’s th birthday, the Mirror meets three boys given hope of beating deadly blood diseases by his legacy.Visit anthonynolan.org for more information or to join the donor register.Georgie McAvoy knows the heartache Shirley Nolan endured searching for a donor to save her son. Because her little boy Daniel was born with the same rare disease that killed Anthony. Daniel, two, has Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome which prevents his blood cells from fighting infection and clotting properly. His only hope is a bone marrow transplant to reset his immune system. A first transplant in June last year failed as Daniel body rejected his donor cells and relapsed.  He is now preparing to undergo another gruelling course of chemotherapy, followed by a second transplant and will spend Christmas recovering in hospital. Georgie, , said: “We have been through so much, but Daniel is still fighting. He has coped with everything that has been thrown at him and he keeps smiling. “We are so grateful for the donor register and everything that Shirley Nolan did – it is the reason that Daniel is still alive.” Daniel’s parents realised something was wrong when he began suffering nosebleeds and they found blood in his nappy when he was three weeks old.He then developed sepsis and spent  days fighting for his le in intensive care.Georgie and dad Andrew, , even asked the hospital chaplain to christen Daniel is his cot as they feared he might not survive.  Georgie, from Huntingdon in Cambridge, said: “The doctors told us he needed a bone marrow transplant to save his le, but that some children didn’t make it to transplant. “It was devastating. We didn’t knowhe would start to walk or go to school. I remember thinking, ‘I need him to be christened in case something happens.’ “It was emotional. Daniel’s big sister Holly wore a christening gown made from my wedding dress and I’d planned for Daniel to wear it too, but that obviously wasn’t possible. Daniel was eventually diagnosed with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects one in every one million boys, in May last year after an unrelated hernia operation. Neither his parents nor Holly, four, were a suitable match, so their only hope was to find a donor through the stem cell register, which the charity Anthony Nolan managed within two months.  Daniel was due to undergo the transplant in March last year, but his procedure was postponed after the Covid pandemic began for fear there would be a shortage of doctors, nurses, or beds. Georgie said: “That was really scary. Daniel had been through all his preparation and we were ready to go, then everything blew up before our eyes. We didn’t know what would happen.” Daniel continued to deteriorate, picking up more infections until his transplant finally went ahead at Great Ormond Street Hospital at the end of June as doctors “could not risk waiting any longer”. He was only allowed one parent with him as he underwent chemotherapy to remove his immune system ahead of the transplant.  Daniel ed home in August but suffered a drug relating seizure, then graft versus host disease as his body tried to reject the donor cells and spent last Christmas in hospital. Georgie said: “The last two relapses have been particularly dficult. During the last one he began vomiting digested blood. His stomach had to be drained constantly. “At that point they said there were no more options, we had to do another transplant and we needed a dferent donor as his body had rejected the first. “It will be hard spending another Christmas in hospital, but we feel so lucky to have found another donor to give Daniel a second chance. That wouldn’t have happened without Anthony Nolan.” Time is running out for Ale Pinckney to find a lesaving stem cell donor. The eight year-old from Exeter relies on weekly blood transfusions to top up his critically low levels of platelets. That has bought Alfie more time, but his condition is getting worse. His desperate family know his only hope is a transplant, but his mixed British and Chinese heritage makes it harder to find a matching tissue type to prevent his body rejecting the donor cells.  Alfie’s mum Lily, said: “It’s so hard to watch your child in pain and be incapable of helping. It’s tearing me apart. Our only hope is to encourage as many people as possible to join the register.” Alfie developed Aplastic Anaemia when he was five years-old. It means his body cannot produce the platelets he needs for his blood to clot properly and he cannot fight infection. At the time his British-born parents Lily and Charles were living and working in Hong Kong. They ed to the UK just before lockdown last year to be near family and step up Alfie’s treatment – just like Shirley Nolan moved home from Australia to search for a donor for Anthony. They hoped they had found a donor earlier this year when a woman in Brazil was confirmed as a matching tissue type, but that fell through.  Since then, Alfie has continued to deteriorate as his body burns through the weekly platelet transfusions and he suffered a terrying haemorrhage. Dad Charles said: “He had a huge, uncontrollable nosebleed and bleeding from the gums. He was clutching the kitchen bin, vomiting blood, screaming “Daddy, help me”. “We rushed him into the high dependency unit and I was mopping blood of his arms, face, and torso as several doctors and nurses tried to keep him alive. It was harrowing. “It’s so easy to join the register. It only takes three minutes to swab your checks, then you can get on with your le. But that could help to save Mason or another child’s le.” Katie Jordan got the devastating news that little Mason had blood cancer on Christmas Eve last year. The only cure for his Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia was a bone marrow transplant but mum Katie was not a good match, nor was anyone on the donor register. Most children with the disease only survive for  months after diagnosis. So Katie, a single mum like Shirley, launched her own campaign to save her son. Mason’s Mission raised nearly £, for Anthony Nolan, helping the charity to test the backlog of , swab samples that built up during the pandemic and add them to the donor register. Katie, from Stockton-on-Tees said: “I was living my worst nightmare. It was heartbreaking to think that Christmas could have been our last together. “I would give my le for Mason, but I wasn’t a match. So I did everything I could to find a donor.”  Thankfully Anthony Nolan did find a suitable donor two months later and Mason had a successful stem cell transplant in March this year. He was rushed back to hospital over the summer after developing blisters all over his body and spent a week fighting for his le in intensive care before they subsided. But the two year-old made a full recovery and is now looking forward to a happy, healthy Christmas. Katie said: “We were lucky that we found a donor so quickly. When they told us, I couldn’t stop crying. I would love to meet his donor one day and thank them.

Adele Thaxter, , said her mixed-race son Lucas Roberts was also called the aposn wordapos by the player, YorkshireLive reports.Adele, from Doncaster, filed a complaint with the police, however she was told officers did not have enough evidence to act, she said.The alleged racist abuse took place when Lucas was playing for Hyde Park Knights Us against the Doncaster-based Edlington White Stars in April.A complaint was also lodged with the Sheffield and Hallamshire FA to look into.  Adele claims the FA have now told her the club will faces charges and may face disciplinary action including an equality course. However, the club insist they have no case to answer and face no charges. Mum-of-three Adele said: “He’d tackled one of their players a couple of times, he said there was some pushing and shoving. “When he tackled one of their players again near the end, he was called the ‘n wordapos. “There was a scuffle and some of our parents tried to break it up. “The mother of the boy he was scuffling with shouted ‘get off him you f*****g P**i. “He was in tears, he was shaking. He was really upset by it. “He was brought home by his friendaposs dad who was in tears at what had happened. He felt like he couldn’t help Lucas.” Adele said coaches from the other team apologised, but when the racial abuse was reported to the police, club officials refused to identy the parent involved. She added: “The police said the only way they could carry on the investigation was to arrest the young boy and question him and I didn’t want that. “It’s not his fault. He needs education, not a criminal record. “If his mother was happy to shout that in public, what’s his le like at home  “One of the managers at the club reported it to the FA. I contacted the FA and made the argument. “They don’t really deal with parents but I think I made the case so strongly the accepted it. “It’s taken a long time but they’ve told me they’ve charged the club and they will have to take an equality course and pay a fine. After the police investigation brought no charges, the club posted on social media that it had been ‘cleared’. They posted: “At a recent match an allegation of a racist comment was made by an opposing team against a player of Edlington White Stars. “This allegation has caused undue stress and hurt to the club and the alleged player, his parents and the team. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter “As a club we have waited til now to release a statement whilst investigations occurred and as a request by the police in order to minimise gossip on social media.” Adele said the statement added to the hurt caused to Lucas because it ‘made out like they were the victims’. She said the club missed an opportunity to acknowledge the incident and address the issue of racism. She said: “This was a chance for them to admit there’s a problem and tackle racism in junior football. Instead, they swept it under the carpet. “The worst thing for Lucas was the statement they put online. It said they’d been found innocent and there was no case to answer. “He was somewhere they were supposed to safeguard him. “I felt angry, I felt powerless. I grew up in the s and s and experienced racism, you don’t expect the same to happen to your children. “It made me feel like when you speak out about it, you’re shut down and these people make you out to be a liar. “I’m glad the FA are taking this action. The most important message for me is that I want to give people confidence to stand up and speak out about racism.” It is understood Edlington White Stars will now have to answer the charges levelled against them ahead of an inquiry which will determine sanctions against the club. Sheffield and Hallamshire FA said: FA series have received the case papers and a commission is looking at this and will decide appropriate sanction for the club. Edlington White Stars was contacted for comment. A spokesman for the club refused to comment other than to say the club is not facing any action.

Kriss attached a letter to a new collar they had bought for Jeff in order to inquire about his home le situation. The letter read: “Hi. This cat has owner  He come to me everyday for food, talk, water and sleep. What happened to him on right side chest  All is ok  Much love!”  Jeffaposs owner Jessica Cowan was in stitches when she saw the note, and was happy to explain the reason for the missing fur. Jeff had a patch missing due to having a blood sample taken as he was losing weight, she explained. The note solved the mystery of why Jeff had been piling on the pounds following the vets visit. Jessica says that she is happy Jeff is making friends and wants him to continue visiting Kriss. Jessica said: “Recently Jeffrey made a few pals in the area. He came home on Monday afternoon with a little note wrapped around his “new” collar. I got a fright and shouted on my mum and dad because I thought I had let the wrong cat in the house. I was chasing this cat all about the kitchen. I ended up grabbing the cat and noticed it was Jeffrey and cut the note off the collar. “I was shocked but I started laughing afterwards because I had recently taken him to the vet as he was a little underweight due to refusing to eat or drink water.  So he got put on antibiotics and had a shaved patch where he got blood taken. “I noticed he put weight back on. I just never took notice of it. But when I saw the message I was happy because when I’m out and about or shopping he can have another home to go to and sit. I wrote a note back with my name and number. He’s not yet texted me but he sent a note back saying his name is Kriss and Jeffrey is a very special cat to him. “I was more than happy for Kriss to keep letting Jeffrey in because Jeff won’t give up trying to get in his house. The man sounds lovely and obviously loves Jeffrey just as much as I do. Jessica explained that sheaposs owned Jeff for the last nine years. We adopted him from a family friend because he wasn’t really enjoying the high rise flats he used to live in, she said. They got him from a cat rescue centre in Leith. “When we got him he was still a baby and very playful. The first night getting him he had attacked my hand and my auntie quickly lted him and put him outside. Around  minutes later he came knocking at the window and that was just the beginning of his tricks. “He tends to give my neighbours frights. The lady up the road came out of her shower and saw Jeffrey curled up in a ball sleeping. She screamed for her brother then we eventually got a knock on the door with Jeffrey in the manaposs arms with a disappointed face because he was caught. He’s known in the area as my dad and I’s cat as we are always out shouting for him but he always s shortly after we call. “When he comes home he tries his luck and opens the door by himself by jumping on the handle bar and lets himself in the house. He can never do any wrong - especially when my nieces and nephews are in the house. When he’s shouted at I crumble shortly after and give him all the cuddles and kisses because I spoil him.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cats\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Several men and a woman are seen holding a man on the ground with his hands bound together by cable ties at a BP petrol station in Whitfield, Kent, at .am on Tuesday. They manage to hold the suspect until police arrived at the scene and made an arrest. It came after the mother reportedly shouted for help as she ran from the shop after hearing her son scream as a man got into her car. She was helped by scaffolders nearby and a woman wearing a McDonaldaposs high-vis jacket.

A leaked video from last December shows key members of the PM’s team giggling as they held a mock press conference in the wake of the December  bash, exclusively revealed by the Daily Mirror. Here dismayed relatives recall how they followed the strict Covid lockdown – even in their darkest hours – while brazen No staff flouted the rules. Lobby Akinnola, who lost his social worker father Femi, , to Covid in April, said he feels a “deep sense of betrayal” and called for Downing Street to be held to account. The -year-old campaigner, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, said the Government’s attitude towards the reports has been “completely reprehensible” and labelled the Prime Minister a liar.  “I sat opposite Boris Johnson, he apologised and said he’d done everything he could [to prevent Covid deaths] and that was a lie. There’s no way to look at that and say it wasn’t, given what we’ve seen.” Lobby – whose father went to work in a woolly scarf and ski gloves because he was not provided with vital Personal Protective Equipment – said those involved in the parties “need to come forward”. “It’s important to note that the culture comes from the top down,” he added. “They were being reckless and what’s worse is they were doing it at Christmas, a time when they knew they had said to everyone that actually you can’t afford to be lax, we can’t afford for you to see your loved ones because the risk to le is too great. “Maybe they don’t hold our lives to the same value because they were like, ‘we can obviously have a party’. It’s just such a deep betrayal – they were supposed to look after us.” **** Sam Bateman’s dad Bob Smith died alone on December  last year after going into hospital with heart failure and a chest infection. Retail worker Sam, a le-long Conservative voter from Maidstone, Kent, said she will never again vote Tory after the video emerged. As the anniversary of her dad’s death approaches, Sam , , said she had begun to decorate her home and put on Christmas songs, “because it’s what dad would’ve wanted me to do”.  But after seeing the video, she feels only anger and sadness. “The video absolutely flawed me - just flawed me with grief and anger,” she told the Mirror. “When I saw that laughing, it was horric. It’s coming up to the anniversary and it’s just made it so much harder to cope with. “When you cannot be there when your parent dies, it’s incredibly dficult to deal with and the video just hit me like a wave.“The ironic thing was that my dad voted for Boris Johnson and voted Conservative all his le. So have I. But I never will again. Never. Dominic Cummings was bad. This is something .“I didn’t know how my dad spent his last moments and I’ve spent  months imagining what happened. And then I see them laughing about a party they held at a time when I was losing my dad, my hero. It’s appalling. “I think now, after Dominic Cummings and everything , Boris Johnson needs to do the right thing and step down. It’s an absolute insult to the thousands of families who have suffered what we have.“ **** Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care, told how she lost her -year-old mum Mary to covid on December . She died in the William Harvey Hospital in Kent. Trish, , told how her mum died without family by her side as they followed rules to ensure the safety of others. She told the she was “devastated” to see the video showing Allegra Stratton, Boris Johnson’s then-press secretary, laughing about the December  party with her colleagues. “It was a dficult death because hardly anyone was vaccinated at that time, so visiting people in hospital carried a high risk of catching covid and potentially transmitting it to others,” she said. To avoid that, none of the family visited my mother with the exception of my son who is a junior doctor and had had one jab. “Certainly one of the factors we took into account when deciding whether to visit mum in her final days was the responsibility not to spread the virus further. We weren’t allowed to visit her anyway until it was clear she was terminal – because of the hospital’s covid rules. “At that point we were permitted to visit but decided very reluctantly that the safest option for everyone was to send in my son but everyone  stay outside. “I was really devastated to see the video of Allegra Stratton and senior politicians joking about a party that appears to have taken place on the very day my mother became unwell with Covid. “They seemed completely unaware of the deep signicance of the sacrices my family and many many others were making – not attending a loved one to provide comfort and say our final goodbyes. “Memories of a Christmas party usually fade quickly - memories of an emotionally painful death never fade. Trish said on the day of the party her mum had called her “breathless and feverish”. She added: “She died without family by her side. I promise you, it wasn’t funny.” **** Jackie Green’s mum Beryl Harris, , died alone in hospital with Covid on the day of the alleged Downing Street Christmas party. She has called on Boris Johnson to resign after the leaked video footage emerged, saying officials’ attitude was “totally reprehensible”. She said: “It’s astonishing - just when you think that things can’t get any worse, something  happens.”  Mrs Harris, , had been shielding at her home in Wellesbourne,Warwickshire, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, so had not seen her only child for  months by the time she was taken to hospital with anaemia.She was then struck down with Covid, but was said to have been on the mend and was due to be discharged on December  . But her condition suddenly worsened and she died on December  - the same day as the alleged staff party at No  where games were played, food and drinks were served, and revelries went on past midnight. Ms Green said the clip sent two messages to the public: “One is that the Government think they are above their own rules, and can behave in any manner in which they please. “And also, it’s saying ‘we don’t actually care about you’. “Some people placed their confidence in this Government when they voted them in - that confidence turns out to be severely misplaced.”She said she was so shocked by the footage of the press conference rehearsal, obtained by ITV News, that she watched it several times to let it “sink in”.She said: “I was absolutely appalled that members of the Government could laugh and joke about a party when people were losing their loved ones. “To put it mildly, it was inappropriate. It was totally reprehensible behaviour. If I’d have had a party, the police would have been knocking on my door, quite rightly so. “The flippancy with which that subjectwas dealt with was absolutely appalling.” Ms Green, who is part of the Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice which has campaigned for the public inquiry into the Government’s handling of the pandemic, said: “Where’s the integrity  They need to actually stand up and tell the truth. “And primarily, Boris Johnson needs to stand up and tell the truth. An apology is not nearly enough for those people that have lost loved ones to Covid, and families that are still suffering because of Covid. “Particularly because hehas denied this repeatedly, and his Government ministers have denied this repeatedly, it would seem like an insult to peoplehe apologised now. “He needs to tell the truth about what happened, he needs to put his hands up to it - have some integrity about the whole thing. The buck stops with him, he’s ultimately responsible. “It’s a serious breach of public trust and public confidence. Andthe Government were allowed to get away with this, it would be an absolute scandal.”  **** Rob Kelleher said his father Bob, , from South Shields was admitted to hospital on December  last year and subsequently died on January , without seeing a member of his family in person again. Mr Kelleher frm Norfolk said his -year-old mother Maureen and the rest of his family are reliving it all over again because of the news about activities in  Downing Street on the day his father was admitted. The -year-old said: “It was the date that triggered all of this because in our mind that is the very last day anybody’s seen my dad. “My mam is sitting at home not watching the telly or even having the radio on because she just can’t deal with this.”  **** Rachel Mewes, from New Hartley in Northumberland, has called on Mr Johnson to resign over the allegations. Rachel’s four-year-old daughter Betsy, who has Down’s Syndrome, is extremely vulnerable to coronavirus because of lung problems caused by her premature birth. However, Rachel says she is not surprised by the allegations. She said: “To be honest, it doesn’t even surprise me after everything that the Government has done. Isn’t that awful  It shows the dference between what they think of themselves and the working classes. “I feel for the families who have lost loved ones only now to find out the people making the rules were flaunting them. It’s disgusting. “My daughter lost all of her services and still doesn’t have all of them back. We have made huge sacrices. We’ve done as much as we possibly can. “It’s so disrespectful when you look at what people have gone through. “The Government don’t live in our world, they’re born with silver spoons.” **** On December  last year, Daisy Harris spoke to her terminally ill mum on Facetime from her hospice bed. It would be her last interaction with her. Helen Harris, , died without the comfort of her family after contracting coronavirus on the very day Downing Street held a Christmas bash. Daisy said of the leaked video: “I don’t really have words for it. Just absolute fury. “Our family and so many other families were suffering.” Helen was diagnosed with a grade four terminal brain tumour in , and had defied doctors who gave her an -month le expectancy. By December , she had been moved to a hospice where Daisy’s family live in Glasgow, Scotland. “I arrived home from university in Manchester to Scotland on December ,” Daisy said. “It was too late to see my mum so my dad put me on Facetime which was the last time I ever spoke to her. “The next day she was diagnosed with Covid. We could have come to see her and stood outside her window but we didn’t want to put extra pressure on the hospice.” The following day, on December , Daisy’s dad was woken up in the early hours by the hospice, who informed the family that Helen was not going to make it. “The government’s failure to lockdown early enough and the reopening in the summer before failing to lockdown early enough again was just shocking,” Daisy said. “Now finding out that they were breaking the rules themselves is heartbreaking. Seeing that video last night made me really upset. “The staff at the hospice were so visibly moved by my mum when those in power were just joking around like it didn’t mean anything to them. “It is coming up to a year since I lost my mum so I was already a bit fragile so this has really brought that home for me. “It has really shaken me up. “I would like to see resignations but what I would also really like to see is accountability,” she added.  Jane Roche’s father Vince Pettitt and older sister Jocelyn Pettitt died within a week of each other in April last year, during the first peak of the pandemic. Jane said: “I’m not happy with the heartbreak he has already caused. “Telling people to go and get their booster jabs is a kick in the teeth. I feel he is constantly letting us down.” Mrs Roche said she witnessed at first-hand the devastating consequences of Covid, having spent the agonising final hours of her father’s le with him in hospital, and having seen the impact it had on Jocelyn. Mrs Roche, of Castle Vale in Birmingham, said she did not accept the Prime Minister’s apology and has campaigned for a full public inquiry into the Government’s handling of the pandemic. The -year-old added: “The videodisgusted me. “How can anybody take them seriously when new measures come in ” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FacetimeConservative PartyBob SmithBoris JohnsonHospitalsHeart diseaseLe expectancyPublic inquiryPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Strangely, for such an exceptional feature, it does not seem to have been documented until the end of the th century, and very little has been written about it since. Situated four metres back into the solid rock of the clf, a narrow tunnel opens out into a small chamber in which there sits a rock-cut bath, roughly one metre deep and always full.According toCornwall Live , the bath was built at the end of the s for the botanist John Stackhouse, who owned nearby Acton Castle. By the end of the th century, the benefits of bathing in sea water and in spring water were widely recognised by the aristocracy, and as a botanist spending time in the spa town of Bath with a special interest in marine algae, this growing health obsession did not escape the attention of Stackhouse. After he married Susanna Acton in , John Stackhouse had Acton Castle built above the remote Cornish cove where he found himself spending most of his time, studying seaweed and marine algae. At some point between  and Stackhouse had two rock-cut baths carved out for him down at the cove. Some say it was because he was suffering from rheumatism, others say that they were for his we, Susanna.  The first bath was a tidal seawater pool, cut into the rock on the beach with steps and a drain to keep the water at a constant level. These outdoor baths cut into rock at beaches can be found where in Cornwall, such as at Portreath, where there are seven of them. However, the second bath, inside a cave that had been carved out of the clf, with its own constant flow of natural spring water, was unlike anything . Roughly two metres above the beach, the entrance to this peculiar bath resembles an adit to a mine shaft- clearly man made in appearance, but with bright green moss and algae cascading out of it and down the rocks to the ground. Originally, there were steps cut into the rock, leading up to the entrance, but these have been worn away by the sea over time. The small tunnel, which is about cm wide and .m high, leads back into total darkness. The only clue of what is at the end is the dripping of the natural bath tap that has been left on for two centuries.  Venturing into the tunnel, as daylight fades, the rich greens and reds of the algal biofilms on the rock begin to glow. The floor of the tunnel is carpeted in a wet green moss. Four metres in, the tunnel opens out into the chamber which is almost entirely taken up by the bath, and has very little light, apart from that coming through the tunnel, and down from a man-made vertical shaft designed to feed the natural spring down into the bath. The first detailed documentation of Stackhouse’s cave bath is considered to be by Michael Tangye, when he wrote about ‘Rock-cut baths in Cornwall’ in the Cornwall Archaeological Society’s  booklet. In it, he writes: “This remarkable and unique feature lies within the rock clf face at the centre of the cove. Here, several feet above the beach level is a tunnel which at first glance resembles a mine adit outlet. It appears to have been originally approached by rock-cut steps ascending from the beach on the south side, of which only one, at the top, has survived sea erosion.”  Writing about the tunnel into the bath chamber, Tangye continues: “Pick marks can be seen on its walls. This leads into a rock-cut chamber ftsquare and fthigh. In its floor a rectangular bath has been sunk ftlong, ft inswide, and ftdeep. The vertical shaft that feeds the bath with slightly alkaline spring water is a sophisticated part of the design, and is described by Tangye as such: “In the north-west corner of the roof, a rectangular chimney-like shaft, again cut from the solid rock, ascends some ftto the clf top. Fresh water, from a small stream, drains into this, falls down the shaft, then through a hole in the stone roof of the chamber, ft insby ft ins , and into the bath beneath. The constant overflow drains along the approach tunnel to the exterior. This fresh water bath, situated within its dark, cold and secluded chamber must have been again created for John Stackhouse and Susanna, his we.” There have been suggestions that for such a sophisticated natural spring-fed bath system to be built, John Stackhouse would have employed experts from Bath, where he also chose his architect for Acton Castle. However, the local knowledge and skill of tunnelling into clfs in that area was unmatched at the time.  Stackhouse had appointed local man John Carter as caretaker and key holder of Acton Castle, and entrusted him with the property for the long periods when he was not there. But along with his brother, Harry, John Carter was a notorious smuggler, calling himself the ‘King of Prussia’ and creating a maze of smuggler’s tunnels on the south coast. Whether John Stackhouse was aware of Carter’s smuggling activities is unclear, but he would certainly have known his skill with a pick axe. Regardless of who built this hidden bathroom, it is unlikely to become popular again soon. Without the long exposures of the camera revealing the warm colours inside, the reality is that this space is cold, dark and teaming with spiders and marine bugs like sea slaters. With the steps eroded away, access is treacherous and the strange echoes inside the cave can be unnerving. But for an th century algae-loving botanist who wanted some privacy on his favourite beach, this bathroom would have been heaven.

Kate gathered , unsung Covid- heroes to record a festive telly spectacular at Westminster Abbey. She was welcomed by familiar faces including Mila Sneddon who stole the duchessaposs heart after she bravely coped with leukaemia during the pandemic. Mila, six, gave the duchess a twirl her green sequinned dress before taking her seat behind the royals. Mila said afterwards: She asked me what I was getting from Father Christmas and I told her I wanted a Barbie Dreamhouse.  I showed her my dress and she said I looked lovely. Mum Lynda said: Last two Christmases Mila has been in hospital so we are looking forward to having Mila at home this year. We are just an ordinary family it is amazon ti be invited. The youngster, from Falkirk, in Scotland, sat behind Kate and the rest of the royals also gave a short reading during the hour-long ceremony.  Popstars Leona Lewis and Ellie Goulding and England footy hero Jordan Henderson and comic Jason Manford sprinkled festive stardust. Zara and Mike Tindall, Sophie Wessex and Princess Beatrice and hubby Edo Mapelli Mozzi, also took their front row seats.

Everyone wore masks in line with new rules to battle the spread of the new Omicron iant of Covid-. Kate, who wore a Catherine Walker coat and sapphire diamond fringed earrings on loan from the Queen, wrote a foreword in the Abbeyaposs order of service. She said: The Covid- pandemic has presented us all with countless and previously unimaginable challenges. We have lost loved ones, seen our frontline workers placed under immeasurable pressure, and we have experienced heart-wrenching isolation from those we hold most dear. “Alongside this, we have seen how communities have come together to support those most in need. And through our separation from others, we have been reminded just how powerful human connection is to us all. Just how much we need one another. And how loving and feeling a sense of belonging to one another can provide comfort in tough times. The importance of simply being together.  “In our roles, William and I are so fortunate to meet and spend time with phenomenal people across the country who day-in day-out support iniduals and families. And over the past two years, we have been truly inspired by countless people who have brought their communities together through simple acts of long and kindness. This carol service is our small way of recognising the inspiring contribution so many of you have made. Thank you. Christmas is a time when we can reflect on the past, listen to one another, focus on the relationships that nurture us and build our resilience, so we can look forward to a shared brighter future.

Skyler - a seven-year-old crossbreed - arrived at Cheshire Dogs Home in May this year, and has seen other dogs come and go, but would like a sofa and family to call her own. The kg dog is already the rescue centre’s longest term resident, but has been homeless for much longer than the  days she’s lived with them, having come in from another centre after she was found as a stray. Manager Anna Stansfield said potential owners have never taken an interest in the black and white dog, as she’s received absolutely no viewings or applications since she arrived.  Anna said: “Skyler was originally a stray from another kennels. I think she gets overlooked because she will need further training, she is seven years old and we find black dogs generally are overlooked.”Statistically speaking, black dogsare harder to rehome – and lurchers are even more dficult due to quirks of the breedaposs personality, which means that the odds really are stacked against poorSkyler .The bouncy dog is well-known at the kennels for her ‘bat-like’ ears, with volunteers wondering when she’ll start to fly. Anna said: “Skyler is a very intelligent girl who loves nothing more than playing with her toys and cuddles. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter. “She is absolutely full of character and would suit a home where she can be the house clown, her style of play involves slapping with her front paws and bouncing around with her toys. “She would be ideally suited to an active home with people looking for exciting walks on top of lots of other forms of stimulation to keep her happy and healthy. Generally, she has a lot to say and can be very vocal when she is excited or wanting attention, she will be needing a home where noise is not an issue.” Skyler - described as ‘sweet and affectionate’ by rescue staff - is in need of an experienced adult only home with no other pets, with owners willing to continue her training on walks. Anna added: “Out on walks she can be quite dficult to handle, generally, without any distractions she walks quite nicely, happy to explore the world with her nose however around distractions such as squirrels, birds or other dogs she can be very strong and dficult to calm down.  “Skyler can be unsettled around other dogs but has done exceptionally well with her ongoing training and can now walk with multiple dogs with no problems. She is in need of continued training in this area and would not be suited to a first time owner. “We know not every home has what Skyler needs but whoever is willing to give her the time she needs will have an amazing friend and wonderful memories ahead in .

He went on to deliver a letter to the home of Bristol mayor, Marvin Rees, claiming responsibility for the arson. In the letter the -year-old said he wanted the attack to be a warning to other venues. He later threw a brick through the window of the Barley Mow pub with a note attached claiming vaccine passports were a breach of human rights.  Then on August  this year Bristol nightclub Lakota received a handwritten saying it would “sustain substantial damage like SWX”it introduced Covid passports. Officers tracked the movements of a man seen starting the fire back to a shop where Marshall had bought a box of matches. He was subsequently identied following a public appeal and he was arrested. Marshall pleaded guilty to charges of arson being reckless as to whether le is endangered, criminal damage and making threats to cause criminal damage at a hearing at Bristol Crown Court in September. He was then sentenced for the three offences at the same court on Wednesday.  Following the sentencing PC David Stevenson said: “Owen Mashall’s actions were motivated by the completely misguided belief the venues he targeted were about to introduce Covid vaccine passports “His obsession with Covid restrictions ultimately led him to carrying out the extremely reckless attack on SWX and it is only through sheer luck no one was physically harmed. “Staff had been at the venue just hours before and they could easily still have been inside when he used an accelerant to start the fire. “More than  fire service personnel were also put at risk tackling the resulting blaze which took several hours to extinguish.aposapos  He added: “The attack has had a devastating impact on the club and the three businesses based below it with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage and lost revenue caused. “These were businesses which had all suffered as result of the pandemic and which were looking forward to serving their community once more only for their livelihoods to again be put in jeopardy. “While Marshall has never explained his actions, I am pleased he ultimately accepted responsibility as it negated the need for a trial.” The attack on SWX took place a week before it was due to reopen in July following months of Covid restrictions. At the time Mayor Rees said it was such sad news for Bristolaposs night time economy as the industry sought to recover from a tough year.

Ian Bennett, , kned Kerry Woolley, also , to death at her flat in Olton, Solihull, West Midlands, on July  last year after ly accusing her of sleeping with another woman. A post mortem revealed that Ms Woolley had suffered more than  kne wounds, most inflicted on her neck. Bennett then roped his mother Lynda Bennett, , into a cowardly plot to help him conceal the crime. She drove him to a canal bridge to dispose of the murder weapons.  But the plan backfired when dash cam footage from her own car helped convict the pair in court. Other evidence found on Bennettaposs phone found that he had researched: The best way to get revenge on a woman. Bennett, of Solihull, was found guilty of murder at Birmingham Crown Court and was jailed for le and ordered to serve a minimum of  years. His mother Lynda was convicted of assisting an offender and perverting the course of justice was sentenced to three years in prison. The court was told how Bennett had called  on the afternoon of the murder, telling officers he had found mum-of-two Kerry with catastrophic wounds to her neck.  He claimed he had left the flat in the early hours of July  and had then been unable to get back in contact with Kerry. Police bodycam footage captured Bennettaposs crocodile tears as he tells cops: Iaposve been trying to call and ring her all day, no answers. So I thought Iaposd knock on. The door wasnapost open so I had to pull the handle and then I walked into that...found her dead. He then points at the door and sobs: Itaposs horric. Although initially no weapon could be located Bennett was arrested on suspicion of murder. His mum was also captured on camera calmly arriving at the scene to ask police why her son was being arrested despite knowing full well what had happened. At one point she even laughs when an officer tells her Bennett is being taken to a station in Coventry and she scoffs: I donapost know how to get to Coventry. Officers analysed text messages between the couple, who only met a few weeks before, which suggested there had been a falling out a couple of days earlier. Bennett appeared to be angry, accusing Kerry of cheating on him, although this was groundless, and that she was also messaging a former partner.  Mobile phone data also revealed that both Bennettaposs and Kerryaposs phones went apossilentapos around .pm on July , despite being in regular contact previously. Bennettaposs phone did become active again at .am, when he made attempts to contact her, knowing that she was in fact already dead. A dashcam in Lyndaaposs car revealed it had left the address Bennett shared with his parents and took a  minute journey round Solihull. Cell site data retrieved from her phone was consistent with Lynda being the driver of the car. The vehicle firstly stopped on Damson Lane, where CCTV footage clearly showed Bennett throwing a bundle into the canal. A large kne with a bent blade was later recovered during a search of the water.  The car then stopped near shops at Prospect Lane, and again CCTV picked up Bennett, carrying a plastic bag into parkland before ing to the car without the bag. Another search of the park land resulted in a bag being recovered and inside were blood-stained womenaposs jogging bottoms and a pair of oven gloves. Forensic examinations later matched Sarahaposs DNA to both the kne from the canal and the blood-stained items found in the park. Two knives had been used, one with a serrated blade, the second with a smooth blade.

Dedicated servants, many who were forced to spend substantial amounts of time away from their loved ones over the pandemic after entering protective bubbles at Windsor Castle and Balmoral to protect the monarch, said there was “palpable anger” at the revelations over illegal lockdown parties in government.The Queen was evacuated from Buckingham Palace at the start of the pandemic and formed a support bubble with her beloved late husband Prince Philip who moved from his home at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.Other royal staff said “sacrices made from the very top all the way down” to keep people safe were being rendered “worthless”. One servant with more than  years service within the household said some colleagues had become “visibly upset” when discussing how the Queen was forced to sit alone at her beloved late husband’s funeral in April due to coronavirus restrictions.Her Majesty, like thousands of others across the nation as the pandemic raged on, complied with covid restrictions leaving them to alter plans for funerals or tragically being unable to say goodbye to their loved ones as they lay dying in hospital. Staff who cared for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh throughout the pandemic told how they had made “huge sacrices” to maintain strict covid bubbles in the belief they were “doing out bit” to keep the monarch safe from the deadly virus. One said: “It would be a gross understatement to say people are angry. “Many missed Christmas, birthdays, other special occasions and weeks on end away from their families. “But it was all in the spirit it was for the greater good and we were doing our bit. “It’s a slap in the face for anyone frankly.”  The Queen was last year forced to spend a final Christmas alone with Prince Philip at Windsor Castle, before he passed away aged  in April. The image of the -year-old dressed in black with a black mask covering nearly her entire face while sitting alone in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle will be forever etched in the nation’s memory. Labour leader Sir Keir on Wednesday highlighted the head of state’s leadership and the sacrices she made at the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral during the Covid- crisis at Prime Minister’s Questions.He was speaking as Boris Johnson faced the furore over claims Downing Street staff broke lockdown rules by holding a Christmas party last year.Sir Keir told the Commons: “Her Majesty the Queen sat alone when she marked the passing of the man she’d been married to for  years. “Leadership, sacrice - that’s what gives leaders the moral authority to lead. “Does the Prime Minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules ” The Queen was due to have her weekly audience with the Prime Minister on Wednesday, either by person or by phone. Buckingham Palace did not comment. Her Majesty has been resting on doctors’ orders and only carrying out light duties such as audiences since spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests on October , and later spraining her back. She is also preparing to film her Christmas Day message to the nation. The Queen is likely to use her annual pre-recorded televised speech, which she writes herself, to reflect on the ongoing challenges facing the country, as well as touching on her own personal grief with the loss of Philip in April. The royal family is hoping to gather to celebrate Christmas with the monarch at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk after last year’s festivities were curtailed due to the pandemic.

Tamekia Thompson, , says she is desperate to move from her south London home. The mum-of-two claims rodents eat her food, and the floors and cupboards are strewn with thousands of droppings.Tamekia, a private tenant who moved into the property in  with her two young children, said the house became infested with mice two years ago, MyLondon reports. She said her seven-year-old daughter is incredibly stressed and she is terried her four-year-old autistic son who will eat anything will ingest the droppings and get sick. Tamekiaaposs landlord claims he has put in measures to address the infestation.  Christian Mantey told MyLondon he has a contract with a pest control company, who have laid traps in the house and have agreed to visit every two weeks to dispose of dead mice and fill in holes. He added that the process is taking longer than usual because pest control cannot put poison down over safety concerns with Tamekiaaposs son. He also explained that the tenant is aware of this. Mr Mantey said he has now issued a Section  eviction notice to Tamekia, who has not paid her rent for around seven months. He said: Iaposve given [Tamekia] her Section  notice telling her to leave because sheaposs in arrears of £,. In terms of the rodent issue in the house, thereaposs been pest control that has come to the property, I think about a month ago while she was there. They set up all the traps and all the other equipment they needed in front of her. She said they canapost put certain traps around because of the kids, so they adjusted the traps according to how she wanted it. They come every two weeks, Iaposve got a contract with them that they will come every two or three weeks to pick up the dead mice or whatever they find, and to fill up the holes. He added: Iaposm doing what Iaposve got to do, the pest control is doing what theyaposve got to do, you canapost eradicate these things straight away. Tamekia claims she is withholding the rent due to problems with the house, including the rodent infestation.She said that she left her job in August to care for her son full time and is now dependent on Universal Credit from Croydon Council to pay her rent, which she says she hasnapost paid due to the mouse infestation.Tamekia says she was told by a pest control worker that, because of the severity of the infection, it would be tricky to get rid of them. Tamekia also said the house also has severe issues with damp on one of the walls. However, Mr Mantey claims Tamekia has never told him that her failure to pay rent is due to her problems with the house, or the mouse infestation. Mr Mantey also claims he has had someone fix the damp in the house two years ago and Tamekia didnapost complain again until two weeks ago. He said he has recently been contacted by Croydon Council about the house, who he said have given him  days to get aposspecicapos jobs done in the house, including fixing the damp and repairing the windows. He said: There are people coming to do the whole property. Iaposm sorting it. Speaking about the mouse infestation, he added: Getting rid of any infestation takes whatever itaposs going to take. Tamekia, who is currently on a housing waiting list with Croydon Council, moved into the house to support her sister, who had access to the property under the Shared Lives scheme through the council. The former care worker said: My kids are scared, screaming, crying, they donapost want to sleep in the room. My daughter said to me aposmummy Iaposm stressedapos... and it really broke my heart. I can tell sheaposs frustrated. She said: [My son] will eat anything, you have to be watching him. Tamekia said her family gets sick a lot: My kids they are vomiting and stuff like that... every minute we are catching colds... itaposs just hard work for me to be cleaning [mouse] poo every day... The council confirmed Tamekia is on a housing waiting list but have advised her to seek alternative accommodation due to a housing shortage. Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, also raised the issue with the council in September, but contacted Tamekia on November  to say he was yet to receive a response. A Croydon Council spokesperson told MyLondon that they have advised Tamekia on her current private arrangement with her landlord. They say they have advised her to seek alternative accommodation through the private rented or social housing sector, as there is a housing shortage. A council spokesperson said: “Although this is not a council property, we have provided Ms Thompson with advice and support around her housing options in both the private rented sector and social housing. We have also been in contact with her landlord about repairs to his property.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Steve ReedSingle mumAutismHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its long term forecast said: To begin the period, drier and clearer conditions are likely, allowing for more extensive frost and patchy fog.  Cloud and strong winds will travel east across the country, with a chance of showers or longer spells of rain for many. Hill snow likely in the north. Temperatures generally around average. Moving through the period, largely unsettled conditions are likely to persist, with the chance of further showers and longer spells of rain, heavy in places, with a chance of gales. Some showers are likely to turn wintry on hills at times. Towards the end of the period, more settled conditions are likely to develop, most likely with milder temperatures, but a chance of some brief colder interludes.The BBC long-range weather forecast says Scotland and Northern Ireland “may continue to be impacted by Atlantic weather systems” during this period.The forecast says the conditions is being driven by an area of high pressure over Europe and low pressure from Iceland.Minimum temperature charts predict lows of C in the North, C in the South and C in Scotland overnight on December , the Express reported.But the latest windchill prediction from WXCharts suggests it will feel like C to-C. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Showers easing away northeastwards with many parts fine for a time, particularly the east. Rain ing to western parts by lunchtime then gradually moving eastwards. Becoming milder in southwest. Tonight: Band of rain clearing eastwards followed by scattered blustery showers. These most frequent in north and west with a risk of hail and thunder. Friday: Sunny spells and scattered showers, though some eastern areas probably staying dry. Showers heavy at times and most frequent in north and west with a risk of hail and thunder. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Dry and frosty start to Saturday, but becoming wetter and milder from the west. Further rain and strong winds at times on Sunday and Monday.

Masks were already mandatory in some places, such as shops, supermarkets and on public transport, before Mr Johnson announced his aposPlan Bapos on Wednesday.Under the new measures, face coverings must now be worn in England in cinemas, hairdressers, theatres, places of worship, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo studios and some other settings. The NHS Covid Pass will be required for entry to nightclubs and venues with large crowds inside. People in England are also being advised to work from homethey can as part of a bid to drive down coronavirus cases. However, the good news is that families will still be able to come together for Christmas dinner and friends can gather at the pub for a festive drink. What are the new rules From December , face coverings must be worn in most public indoor settings in England, including cinemas, hairdressers, theatres and places of worship. It will also become the law to wear them in nail salons, massage centres, tattoo studios, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors, accountants and during driving tests and lessons, Under Plan B, the NHS Covid Pass will also become a requirement for entry to nightclubs and venues with large crowds inside from December . This includes unseated indoor events with  or more people and unseated outdoor venues with , or more iniduals present.New rules also say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days.  How is this dferent from the existing rules  Since November , it has been mandatory to wear masks in shops, supermarkets and on public transport but this rule has now been extended.The Prime Minister did not add any additional travel rules, although these were tightened last month. Arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world are now forced to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival. They must also isolate until the result comes back negative. Since December , people flying back to the UK are also required to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight. The NHS Covid Pass rule for nightclubs is also a sht, with people previously able to show a negative test to enter.  Can I still go to the pub and enjoy Christmas dinner with my family  Yes, pubs will remain open under the plans and you will be able to meet your loved ones for Christmas dinner. There is no indication that the Rule of Six will , meaning there are no limits on social gatherings inside or outside. Boris Johnson rejected the suggestion that festive parties and nativity plays should be cancelled during Wednesdayaposs Downing Street press conference. It means parties are allowed but office work is discouraged.Last Christmas the rules looked very dferent, with a tiered system of restrictions in place across England. People were told to stay at home in London, south-east and east England as they were placed in Tier . Households in other parts of the country were allowed to mix on December , although long-distance travel was discouraged. This year it looks like the rules will not be as strict, although the Prime Minister has refused to rule out a Christmas lockdown so there is still a chance things could change.

Regulations will then “sunset” on January , Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs. But both of these days could be brought forward or pushed back so they’re not actually massively relevant.We can glean some information from the criteria for triggering Plan B in the first place.The government will likely base its decision to lt restrictions on the state of the NHS, the link between hospitalisation and infections, vaccine efficacy and immunity, and the impact of new iants.

Rich German and Matt Wheaton were paddle boarding when they encountered an enormous sunfish. They were in the US city of Laguna Beach, Calornia when they made the freaky discovery.Mr German said: “My buddy, Matt, and I were just paddling and came across it… it was hard to miss! It was nine to  feet long, way bigger than myself.“It’s hard to compare a sunfish to other creatures because they are so bizarre looking – they look like a mutilated shark that got bitten in half. I’ve seen many over the years but this was definitely the biggest.”  The world’s largest bony fish by weight was another sunfish caught in  off Kamogawa – a city in Chiba, Japan, says the Guinness World Records. It weighed ,kg and measured ft in long – and though the two men didn’t measure the fish they encountered, they’re confident it was bigger. “Well we didn’t catch it or have a measuring tape but the largest sunfish on record is ft in,” said Rich, . “Matt’s board is ft long, he added, andyou look at the pics you can see for yourself how big it looks.  I would guess it was at least nine to  feet long… my buddy and I were blown away when we saw it.” Julianne Steers of Beach Ecology Coalition said there was only one way to say for sureit was a record-breaking specimen. “The only true way to know isit was out [of the water] and weighed and officially measured,” she told the OC Register. “But it does look much larger than what we typically see out here.”  Mr German, who founded Project O – a non-profit organisation dedicated to ocean conservation – has been out in the water almost every day for over a decade. But this encounter shows that, even for him, the sea still holds surprises. He said: “I’ve been paddling here in Laguna Beach pretty much every day for the past  years and I’ve had over , encounters with dolphins and whales. “This was more proof that you never know what you will see out on the ocean!” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World recordsSharksDolphinsBig Fish\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If you look like a piece of garbage, like how I usually fly, you’re never going to get upgraded.

Then when it snowed the neighbour, who is in his s, turned to the man for help and asked him to clear his drive - but the man said he wouldnapost do it unless he was paid. The neighbour refused so the man didnapost help, but now his we is saying he was in the wrong and should have done the work as the man was old and needed help. What would you have done in that scenario  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the man said: This summer, he told us that my relationship with him was no longer friendly, and we were to be strictly neighbours for the rest of the time that we lived together. Last night we got our first big snow of the season. Instead of snow blowing his driveway like I usually do, I snow blowed mine and went back inside.  minutes later, he texted me saying that he was going to breakfast with his friend and needed his driveway snow blowed so he could get out.  I responded that I would no longer be doing his driveway for free since he had said that our relationship was no longer friendly. I offered to do his driveway for £ , or I said he could pay one of the kids that live in the neighbourhood. He got pissed and told me that he didn’t have time to coordinate with the neighbourhood kids and that he needed his driveway snow blowed. I told him I would do it for £. He said he refused to pay me to do his driveway. So I told him I wouldn’t do it. It’s later in the day now and he hasn’t cleared his driveway yet. I feel great, but he called me an a*****e in his texts and my we told me I might be an a*****e because he’s old.

After seeking advice online, other Reddit users rushed to the manaposs defence and said he did nothing wrong. One said: People need to realise being old isnapost an excuse to behave like an a*****e. Would you feel badhe was in his s  Nope. He made his bed now he can lie in it. And a second wrote: My son shovels out the elderly neighbouraposs driveway, which is crazy long and steep to boot. She gives him fty bucks and tells him heaposs the most handsome boy in the world. Iaposm just saying this is the minimum standard. Tell your neighbour youaposll do it for  or fty bucks and being told youaposre the most handsome boy in the world. While a third added: If he wants neighbourly kindness, he has to be a kind neighbour. He made it very clear he wasnapost interested in that kind of friendly relationship, so you donapost owe him more than he asked for, which was strictly neighbours. If the old b*****d needs your help, he needs to be your neighbour and not an a*****e.

But one mum has vowed not to rely her own mother-in-law for childcare support, even going as promising to never leave her daughter alone with her.The -year-old mum had always gotten along with her husband Japoss mum, however they recently butted heads after she asked when they would be getting their -month-old daughter Caposs ears pierced. The mum told her mother-in-law that C would not be getting her ears pierced until sheaposs old enough to ask to have them done herself, and in response, was told that sheaposs a hypocrite considering she has several piercings herself. My own mother wouldn’t let me even get my earlobes pierced until I was , but my mother-in-law had both had both my sister-in-lawsapos ears pierced when they were tiny, and she keeps going on about how aposit’s better because they won’t remember itapos, the mum wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.J says he supports whatever decision I make on the matter because I’m the one who would have to clean it, as I stay home with C while he works full time. The mum thought the issue had been put to bed, until a few weeks ago, when her mother-in-law was taking care of C for them as they were going to a funeral. As I was coming down the stairs I hear my mother-in-law talking to C about how aposthey’re going to go out shopping and get her some pretty earrings.apos I went into the room and told her in no uncertain terms that that would not be happening, andI can’t trust her to respect my decisions about my own daughter I would find someone  to look after her, she continued, adding that she ended up getting her sister to babysit.

Now my mother-in-law keeps trying to arrange to have her for a few hours, she even tried to offer to have her overnight so J and I can go out, but I refused. I told her she could come and visit her, but I no longer trusted her not to get her ears pierced behind my back, so she would be seeing her unsupervised. The mum said that both her husband and her sister-in-law think sheaposs overreacting, prompting her to turn to Reddit to question whether others thought her reaction was justied. She definitely intends to get her ears pierced. Iaposm of the opinion that itaposs unfair to put a baby through unnecessary pain, as they canapost understand it. Vaccines serve a purpose and are justied, but earrings donapost. Your daughter will grow up just fine without them and can ask for them when sheaposs ready, one Reddit user commented. The bigger concern is your mother-in-law not respecting your authority as the mother. Please donapost allow her unsupervised visits with your daughter as she doesnapost seem trustworthy. Another agreed: Of course her children think youaposre overreacting they were raised by this human bulldozer and donapost know any better. Their opinions on boundaries canapost be trusted. Also, the idea that your husband defers to you because you would be solely responsible for the care and cleaning just because you stay home  Like... is he incapable of holding a Q-tip between the hours of  and pm  She is his daughter, too, and he absolutely has a vested interest in whether his mother goes behind both of your backs to do this.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Shannon Richardson, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, says her -month-old son Freddie had been inexplicably waking up every night around am and refusing to go back to sleep, leaving her and partner Jack Gray perplexed. However, the couple were horried to discover the aposexplanationapos - when they heard a aposdeep male voiceapos talking to little Freddie through the camera, which was so clear they thought someone was in the house at first. Racing into their sonaposs room, Jack ripped the aposhackedapos monitor out of the wall from where it had been positioned to film their youngster - before throwing it into a skip. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Shannon, , was left so scared that it could be a aposlocal manapos that she insisted on staying at her mumaposs house even after it had been thrown away and once home had Freddie stay in bed with her. Now the care assistant fears that the man could have been watching their son for weeks and even seeing the couple trying to calm him, with images on the monitor showing Jack climbing into the cot to try to sooth his son. Shannon said: The sickness, upset and disgust we feel is awful. How long has this creep been watching Freddieaposs room  We get him changed after bath times and put him to bed in there. We donapost know how long this has been going on for because, for a while, heaposd been waking up at the same time in the night at around am and we werenapost able to settle him. Jack was getting in the cot to try and comfort him. Weaposd been trying to settle him and nothing would work so we think someone was waking him up. But now weaposve removed the baby monitor, he hasnapost been waking up in the night. Images caught on the monitor show Jack, who works in fire and flood restoration, comforting his son in the cot in the middle of the night in the weeks leading up to the incident in October, to no avail. Shannon said: It was around .am and me and Jack were watching TV. We had the camera on and we heart rustling so we watched it for a minute thinking it was probably Freddie moving around in his cot. All of a sudden, we heard this really deep, male voice and it was so clear, we thought he was in the bedroom. He was saying aposbabyapos and aposbabaapos like he was trying to wake Freddie up. Jack ran upstairs and barged into Freddieaposs room. No one was in there but the monitor moved towards Jackaposs direction. The voice had come through the monitor. Jack just ripped the monitor out of the wall and picked Freddie up. We went into our bedroom and just sat there not knowing what to do. We were in shock. I didnapost know what to believe or to think. Shannon says the manaposs voice had been so clear that they thought someone was in the house and that the incident has left her feeling scared in her own home. Shannon said: Jack threw the monitor in a skip. I didnapost want to be in my house, I kept going to my mumaposs even though the monitor was gone. I didnapost feel comfortable and I was on edge. I was scared because we didnapost knowit was a local man. I wasnapost comfortable putting Freddie to bed on his own so he was sleeping in my bed with me but I had to eventually put him in his own bed so he didnapost get too used to being with me. Shannon had been given the video baby monitor as a gt while she was pregnant and had been using it ever since Freddie was born, Shannon said: I thought it was really handy because when he was in bed, it was nice to be able to see him. Weaposve been using it since he was born. Baby monitors are supposed to be a safe thing to watch your baby. You would never think that someone  would be watching them through it.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Nabille McHugh, , says baby Atlas weighed an average healthy lbs oz when he was born - but had a huge growth spurt aged two months. Now the . inch-tall tot weighs just over two stone and is so heavy Nabille has to frequently switch sides when she holds him, and use her leg as support. She says her son, who is ten months old, now turns heads everywhere he goes thanks to his adorably chunky bod - but not all comments are welcome. She said: Whenever anyone holds him, everyone has something to say about his size - whether itaposs their back hurts, or their arms canapost handle it, itaposs always a comment.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Most non-family members comment on my apostoddleapos and are shocked when I tell them he is still an infant. The mum from Denver, Colorado, USA, has , followers on TikTok after sharing videos of her son on the . Some of the questions I get are aposwas he that big when he was bornapos, aposare you ok apos, aposwhat do you feed him apos and aposare you small or is he big apos she said. Nabille discovered she was pregnant with her second child with husband Tyler McHugh, , when she was only three weeks along. She said: We were trying to get pregnant so I was testing religiously - I was stoked! I immediately felt shivers down my spine and screamed. My daughter really wanted a sibling and I couldnapost wait to give her the news. Her pregnancy was relatively stress-free, and her bump remained a normal size even though Atlas was measuring two weeks ahead.Atlas was born on January   at : pm and weighed a healthy lbs oz. I was in love when I first saw him! said stay-at-home-mum Nabille. His large stature definitely comes from dads side of the family, my side of the family is short, my husbandaposs side is all six feet and up. He was average size for a newborn, but he kind of started hitting his growth spurt between two and four months and has been steadily growing since then.  Atlas is slowly starting to move on to solids, and Nabille says she breastfeeds him five times a day. My daughter ate way more than he does. He’s heavy, but I make do with it because how can I not hold him! I just have to switch sides and use my leg to prop him up most of the time. Of course, my back hurts but it’s worth it. Not going to lie, he grows out of his clothes way too fast. He is currently in M clothes and this is the longest stretch we have gone with this size, but he was never in newborn size. The doctors have no concern as his weight and height are proportional on the growth chart, he is just bigger overall, but no weight issues whatsoever. While many comments have been positive, the mum has also been plagued with trolls. She said: Every now and then there are negative and nasty comments about my son or accusing me of bad parenting because of his size. I get so many people telling me that I used a filter to make him look that big, I think thataposs just hilarious! The tough mum knows to ignore or block the haters and wants to continue showing off her gorgeous son, and four-year-old daughter Aria, to the world. She said: I would just like to normalize bigger babies, big babies have always been around but social media hasnapost. Not because a baby is bigger or smaller than average means that they are automatically unhealthy or something is wrong with them. Babies come in all shapes and sizes, I would know since I have two kids - one was tiny and one big.

She says it is where she is happiest, and after her most recent trip she looked back through her images and was shocked by what she saw. In the face of one wave, which rose up after splashing against a sea wall, she saw the likeness of God - specically as his son, Jesus, being one of his coeternal states as explained in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. What do you think about Traceyaposs picture  Let us know in the comments...Tracey said: I have a relationship with the sea. I spend most of my time on the coast - Itaposs where I am happiest. I love watching the waves and I love taking photographs. Combining the two is my idea of heaven. I noticed due to high tide and effects of Storm Barra, the waves were splashing against the steps that lay horizontally to the beach, almost along its full . The waves were quite big at times. I took lots of photos but it wasnapost until I was going through them to find one or two to put on social media that I came across this image with God in it. I was so excited. I feel really blessed.

Some had even inflated body parts with rubber bands and used fillers to relax their faces. Many are believed to have had Botox injections or other articial touch-ups.  The King Abdulaziz Camel Festival, which kicked off earlier this month, sees breeders of the most beautul of the animals enter their camels to compete.

The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer mission, or IXPE, began at am on Thursday with hopes of gaining new insight into some of the most extreme objects in the universe. Space enthusiasts can watch live coverage of the launch on NASA TV and the agencyaposs website. The satellite set off into the sky aboard a SpaceX Falcon  rocket from NASAaposs Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Nasa confirmed IXPE began its orbit around Earth at an altitude of around  miles. The spacecraft separation took place  minutes into the flight and unfurled its solar arrays around one minute later. Lead investigator Martin Weisskopf said: “It is an indescribable feeling to see something you’ve worked on for decades become real and launch into space.  “This is just the beginning for IXPE. We have much work ahead. But tonight, we celebrate. Mr Weisskopf came up with the idea for the spacecraft and has conducted experiments in X-ray astronomy since the s. Three state of the art telescopes are onboard the spacecraft which is a collaborative effort of NASA and the Italian Space Agency. The technology works by measuring X-rays released by black holes and neutron stars, a term which refers to the collapsed centres of supergiant stars. IXPE is not as big as NASAaposs Chandra X-ray observatory but big hopes are resting on the mission.  Space experts say the satellite will reveal more information on cosmic rays which move through space at almost the speed of light. Thomas Zurbuchen, an associate administrator at NASA Headquarters in Washington, said: “IXPE represents another extraordinary first. “Together with our partners in Italy and around the world, we’ve added a new space observatory to our fleet that will shape our understanding of the universe for years to come. Each NASA spacecraft is carefully chosen to target brand new observations enabling new science, and IXPE is going to show us the violent universe around us – such as exploding stars and the black holes at the centre of galaxies – in ways we’ve never been able to see it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NasaItalian Space AgencySpace\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

British socialite Maxwell is accused of preying on vulnerable young girls and luring them to massage rooms to be molested by Epstein between  and . Images shown to a New York court during her trial show Epstein and Maxwell embracing one another, riding a motorbike and flying on private jets. One also shows an advert created in which massage therapists were asked to apply to Epsteinaposs Palm Beach home at weekend. Maxwellaposs criminal trial entered its eighth day on Wednesday, after jurors heard testimony from three women who said they were teenagers when she set them up for sexual abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.  Prosecutors are expected to call one more alleged victim to take the stand, and may wrap up their case as soon as Thursday, about two weeks faster than they had originally forecast. The defence would then have a chance to present a case. It is unclear whether Maxwell would testy, given the prospect she could face a y cross-examination by prosecutors. Maxwell, , has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges for her alleged role in recruiting and grooming girls for Epstein to abuse between  and . Her lawyers have said her accusersapos memories have been corrupted over the years, and that Maxwell is being scapegoated for Epsteinaposs alleged conduct. The globetrotting investor died by suicide in  in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting his own sex abuse trial.  Two of the women who have testied, identied as Jane and Carolyn, said they had sexual contact with Epstein starting when they were . Carolynaposs case underlies Maxwellaposs sex trafficking charge, because she was allegedly paid for interactions with Epstein. She said the encounters began as massages before escalating. In more than four hours of often tearful testimony on Tuesday, Carolyn recalled telling Maxwell about her troubled childhood, including that her mother was an alcoholic and that she was molested by her grandfather at age . She also said she was nude and preparing to massage Epstein, when Maxwell once fondled her. What she did was wrong, Carolyn said. Maxwellaposs lawyers have argued that Carolyn, Jane and a third woman who testied for the government, Kate, had incentives to implicate Maxwell because they received seven-figure settlements from a compensation fund for Epsteinaposs victims. Kate was described as a victim in the  indictment against Maxwell, but U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan ruled that her encounters with Epstein were not illegal because she was old enough to consent.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Private jetsCrimeTeenagersAlcoholismGhislaine Maxwell\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A mobile office and chemical toilet would also be onsite for that duration.It would require a -square-metre area in the north of the former power station site to be fenced off for the duration.Plans are with East Lothian Council and can be viewed on the planing portal."},{"url":null,"title":"snack-van-shore-road-car-park-john-muir-way-dunbar-approved","story":"The plans for the van at the Shore Road car park, on the John Muir Way at Belhaven, drew  protests and were described by one elected councillor as ldquosacrilege.Local residents pleaded with East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee to refuse planning permission, arguing it went against everything naturalist John Muir, who was born in Dunbar, stood for and strived to achieve.Other residents pointed to road safety concerns on the streets surrounding the car park, which at one point last year saw , vehicles a day visiting it.Local residents said that their streets were already jammed by the overspill of the car park, which sits near a popular surf school which operates from the bay, adding that the snack van would only attract more visitors.One man said thathe left his home to go grocery shopping at the weekend, he wouldto find he could not park within half a mile of his home, adding: ldquoIf that is not impacting on my amenity, I donrsquot know what is.However, Councillor Norman Hampshire, local ward councillor, council leader and planning convenor, insisted that the snack van ndash which will be powered by batteries rather than a generator and use compostable cutlery ndash would be a welcome addition for people who visited the beach and walked the John Muir Way.He told protesters: ldquoA lot of people are not fortunate to be able to buy a house close to the beach and they would enjoy the opportunity to walk down there and enjoy a cup of coffee.Fellow ward councillor Sue Kempson called in the application for the van to the committee after planning officers recommended it for approval.At a previous bid to put a snack van on the site two years ago, which was thrown out,Dr Kempson described visitors to the van as having their ldquogrotty coffee, adding:ldquoIrsquom sorry but I have used snack bars and never had decent coffee [from them].Dr Kempson told the committee that she was concerned about the impact of the new snack van, which was being sited at a dferent point of the car park, further away from housing, on thegrass area it was designated.She supported residents concerns about the snack van being on the John Muir Way.She said: ldquoTo give permission for this van on the John Muir site, Dunbar, is to me sacrilege.Jacquie Bell, from Dunbar Community Council, which also objected to the snack van, pointed out that the Shore Road car park was ldquoan anomaly among coastal car parks in East Lothian because it was next to residential streets.She said: ldquoThis is not a NIMBY objection, the priority concern is road safety.And she criticised the council for advertising the site as a potential snack van placement, saying the financial gain for the local authorityof tendering the site was ldquooutweighedby the impact of the van.Bethan and Markos Akgum, who applied for permission to operate the snackvan at the site, said that they had switched to electric batteries and reduced the size of the van, as well as changing its colour, after feedback from the community.Bethan told the committee that plans were in place to monitor litter by using branded compostable containers, which she suggested could be marked with the initials of customers to make them more responsible for disposing of them properly.The efforts of the applicants were welcomed by many councillors on the committee.Mr Hampshire said that he had lived in Dunbar all his le and had fond memories of visiting the bay while growing up and with his family, and the provision of a snack van would be appreciated.He said: ldquoEvery time I am down at Belhaven, someone will come and ask me lsquowhere can I buy a coffee rsquo and there is nowhere, only a long, long walk to buy a cup of coffee.ldquoThe van will be adjacent to the John Muir Way and hundreds of walkers will welcome it. I think it will be an asset to people who use the bay.The committee voted by  votes to one to approve the snack van.

been carried out ndash leaving the roads and pedestrian networks around the area at breaking point.Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell told the planning committee at its online meeting on Tuesday: ldquoThis proposal has infrastructure holes like Swiss cheese, questions that need resolving and time constraints when we need time to review.The committee was asked to approve Taylor Wimpey plans for  houses and  flats at Hallhill, Dunbar, in the final phase of a wider development in the area.Among contributions agreed between the developers and planners was pound, towards a bridge or crossing for the East Coast Main Rail Line which will be needed as part of the infrastructure of the estate.: Bid to sell alcohol from Hallhill Sports CentreEast Lothian councillor Jeremy Findlay, a

would be far higher and the council was likelyto face some shortfall, they insisted the contribution had been calculated using an index to cover inflation.Councillor Lachlan Bruce asked: ldquoIs it usual to use decade-old figures for determining contributions for infrastructure for a development to go ahead He was told it was not normally the case but recalculating the cost of such a complex project could take years.Mrs Bell said that the community council had concerns which had grown in recent years as housing in parts of the estate had been built and families moved in.She said concerns

galling to see developer contributions go to junctions  miles away.Mrs Bell said pedestrians were in conflict with vehicles on the roads around the estate and urged the committee to consider a continuation of a decision on the planning application until more answers could be sought.Councillor Findlay moved a motion for a delay to the decision, citing a need to update the contributions being requested for the East Coast Main Line crossing but was defeated by eight votes to three.The committee then approved the plans by  votes to one with only Councillor Findlay against.A further

The UK Government and devolved governments are expecting charities to fill the gap and are failing to do their moral duty to all their constituents and look after the deprived.There is something far wrong when millionaires have had substantial increases in their finances during this pandemic when so many have suffered. Since the end of the Second World War, company senior management and directors have increased their income by incredible percentages and have more money than any fair-minded person would agree was acceptable. Many of these people own more property and other goods than they can ever use.Privatisation of public utilities has led to poor services but large profits for shareholders. Scottish Water is one utility still in public hands and is endeavouring to bring facilities up to standard and is still keeping bills at a reasonable level. Other utilities have been split up into small sections with each one expected to show a profit, thus to leading bigger bills for the public.We must have changes so that everyone is looked after as happens in the Scandinavian countries, where the gap between the haves and have-nots is limited and the majority of the electorate are contented with their lot.Ian Turner, Bearsden.LACK OF FORESIGHT ON GAS BOILERSI WAS surprised that the Scottish Government has decreed that no new gas boilers will be supplied and fitted after , which is just over four years away. The problem is that more than a third of the population of Scotland are at present unable to afford the current energy bills, let alone the alternatives, which have to be supplied and fitted at the householders expense.Admittedly a small and totally inadequate grant is available for the heat exchanger types, but these are untried and untested on any scale in this country. There are also drawbacks, such as the current radiators in houses here being unsuitable.The green lobby does not seem to care about what happens to people as long as their policies are fulfilled. However, I thought that the Scottish Government would have adopted a more responsible attitude to the matter of our people being able to keep their houses warm in winter. After all, this lack of foresight could well result in a great many premature deaths, especially among the elderly.James Evans, Dumbarton.ANDREW MARRS WINING FORMULAI AM at odds with Neil Stewarton his criticism of Andrew Marrs interviewing style.He alleges that Marrs constant interruptions preclude guests from giving the response he is seeking. I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that politicians in particular have a knack of re-orienteering the question to one that they wish to answer or taking the opportunity to dwell on some other aspect of their endeavours rather than the matter being discussed. The Governments successful roll-out of the vaccine programme is continually employed to detract from other major failings.Andrew Marrs success is that he does have the ability to get members of the Government on his show whereas Newsnight is constantly apologising for the failure of ministers to make themselves available.David G Will, Milngavie."},{"url":null,"title":"new-project-improve-salmon-farm-welfare-sustainability","story":"The scheme, run by The Scottish Salmon Companyat its Applecross sites, will also see the creation of  new jobs in the northwest Highlands.The four-year aquaculture research and development project aims to increase the size of smoltsin an ecologically sustainable way using innovative new technology.If successful, it is hoped that the research will ldquosignicantly advance salmon farming in Scotland.Highlands and Islands Enterprisehas approved up to poundm of investment, with a further poundm confirmed by Marine Scotland.Announcing the funding, Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:ldquoThis investment underlines our commitment to promoting sustainable development for the aquaculture sector.ldquoI welcome the new approach being taken by The Scottish Salmon Company since it became part of the Bakkafrost Group and the introduction of new management.ldquoThe project will deliver on improved fish and welfare, applies innovation to address key challenges and contributes towards sustainability.

The investors claim that ldquorenewables and networks are intrinsically dferent businesses with inidual funding needs, growth profiles and strategic priorities. The article goes on to say the combination of renewables and network assets is depriving shareholders of pound billion value because they do not belong together.I find this cynical prioritising of shareholder value over the engineering and ultimately the consumer interests in efficiency, security and cost control deeply upsetting. The strategic priority is to recognise that the integration of generation and network is a real-time absolute and demands engineering discipline. Anything which intervenes to confound this fact can only lead to increased risk and costs to the consumer.This highlights all the problems of establishing a viable secure and efficient public electricity supply when it is being controlled by bankers rather than engineers.The establishment of a National Energy Authority is an urgent priority.Norman McNab, Killearn.NO MORAL SUPERIORITYBOB Ballantynecannot be allowed to get away with his claim that,the father of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and his partner ldquohad been religious, they ldquocould not possibly have carried out the boyrsquos ill treatment and murder. He should try telling that to the many victims of physical and sexual child abuse when in the care of schools or other institutions run by religious orders.The truth is that those who choose to belong to a religion are no better than those of us who do not. Clearly people have every right to choose to believe in a god, or gods, and to try to live their own lives under the rules of their chosen religion. But they have no credibilitythey try to imply, as Mr Ballantyne does, that they are somehow better people than those of us who live in a more rational world. Given the human misery caused by stre between religions, sects and denominations, followers of religions have no cause at all to claim moral superiority.Alistair Easton, Edinburgh.GOLDEN DAYS ON THE GREENTUESDAYrsquoS golf column by Nick Rodger is always a delight to read and his views on ldquogreen reading paraphernalia was no exception . It jogged my memory to an article I read a few years ago in the golfing column of an oldmagazine in which the author was bemoaning the prevalence of slow play.In particular he singled out the time spent on the green assessing a putt and offered the following advice which I have frequently proved still applies today: ldquoAs the golfer approaches the green, the line of the putt which he instinctively sees is the correct one.\" In the same article he also said that these days it is not uncommon for rounds to exceed two hours.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In an update to the Scottish Parliament this Tuesday afternoon, she explained that the nation#s coronavirus restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis in the wake of an increasing number of Omicron cases.She has urged everyone across Scotland to stick closely to the guidelines. This included strict guidance to employers with staff who can fulfil their duties from home and testing before mixing with people from other houses.These changes come as Orkney recorded seven cases over the past  hours, according to the daily figures published by the Scottish Government. This has brought the county#s total to .On the new restrictions, the First Minister said: “To be blunt,you had staff working from home at the start of the pandemic, please now enable them to do so again.##I#m asking you to do this from now, until the middle of January, when we will review this advice again.#She also said: #Test and Protect is deploying enhanced contact tracing for all cases with the s-gene drop-out that is indicative of Omicron.

Wild birds including waterfowlcan carry and transmit the virus without showing evidence of disease, according to Paul Walton, head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland.ndash How do you spot bird flu There are two types of avian influenza, with Highly pathogenic avian influenzabeing the more serious type. It is often fatal in birds.Some of the clinical signs of HPAI in birds include sudden and rapid increase in the number of birds found dead, several birds affected in the same shed or air space, a swollen head, closed and excessively watery eyes, head and body tremoring, drooping of the wings and or dragging of legs, twisting of the head and neck and swelling and blue discolouration of comb and wattles. vw,vw,px, px\"Chickens at Leicestershire-based egg producer Sunrise Poultry Farms playing with a football while they are stuck indoors during the bird flu lockdown Other signs include haemorrhages on shanks of the legs and under the skin of the neck, loss of appetite or marked decrease in feed consumption, sudden increase or decrease in water consumption, respiratory distress, sneezing, noticeable increase in body temperature, discoloured or loose watery droppings, and cessation or marked reduction in egg production.ndash What measures are in place An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone was declared across the UK on November  before being extended on November  with the added requirement all captive birds have to be kept indoors.Defra said poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from a vetthey have any concerns.ndash What is the risk to the public The risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, Defra said.People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that they find and instead report them to the relevant helpline. vw,vw,px, px\"Swans with their cygnets in Bushy Park in London in May Defra said there is no impact on the consumption of properly cooked poultry products including eggs.ndash Is it still okay to feed birds in your garden The RSPB said everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, and also recommended ldquoregularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands.UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said people who keep chickens and want to feed wild birds need to make sure everything is kept ldquoscrupulously clean and ldquoabsolutely separate to avoid infecting their own flocks.ndash What should you doyou see a sick or injured bird The RSPB saidpeople find any dead waterfowl, any gulls or birds of prey or five or more of any other species in one place, they should report them to the Defra helpline on   or in Northern Ireland to DAERA on   .ndash Will the outbreak have any impact on the availability of turkeys at Christmas Supplies of turkeys or other birds over Christmas are not expected to be affected by the outbreak.More than  million turkeys are produced in the UK every year so the number in relative terms that are affected is very small and it is unlikely to affect the overall supply of Christmas turkeys.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4300089.jpg--.jpg?1638952026000\n","title":"barbers collect christmas gifts","story":"BALLYMENA barbers have called on the local community to donate a Christmas gt to local young people leaving care.The Barbers Collective, in partnership with VOYPIC-Voice of Young People in Care- are calling on customers, shoppers, and local residents to pick up an extra gt, to donate to a young care leaver this Christmas. Presents can be left under the tree in their Church Street shop until  December. Alternatively, vouchers for a haircut in the store can be donated.According to latest figures, around  young people, aged -, leave care each year in Northern Ireland. With more children in care now than ever before, the number is set to grow over the coming years.VOYPIC works across the region, supporting children in care and young people leaving care. The organisation runs ious groups and forums from its office on Garfield Place, as well as supporting inidual young people through coaching and an independent advocacy service.Iain Black, Northern Area Manager at VOYPIC, said, “Christmas is a happy time for most, but for some young people it can be tough. Young care leavers often feel isolated, and Christmas can be a particularly dficult time.“We know that young men leaving care can face a whole range of additional challenges, so we hope that by partnering with The Barber Collective we can start a conversation on how we can help them feel more connected and valued across our community.”Chris Power, from The Barber Collective, explained why the business has decided to support young care leavers.He said: “We realise that we are fortunate enough to be in the position to give and receive gts. Not everyone is as fortunate, but everybody should have a present on Christmas morning.”Gts should be suitable for young people, aged - years old. Presents for young men are particularly need this Christmas. Popular gts include hats, scarves and gloves, home essentials, toiletries, and sweet treats. Gt vouchers, including phone top-ups, utilities vouchers, and supermarket gt cards, are particularly welcomed by young people.Alternatively customers of the Barber Collective can ‘pay it forward’ by gting a voucher for a free haircut to a young man with experience of care.Stuart Forsythe, a care experienced Young Leader in VOYPIC, welcomed the initiative stating: “Sometimes, getting your hair cut can drop down the list of priorities, especially when money is tight. But, sitting in the chair, it gives you time to stop and take a breath, to have a chat with the barber, and to take some time for yourself.”“And, getting your hair cut- it just makes you feel better,” he added.Gts can be left under the tree at the The Barber Collective, Church Street, during working hours until Saturday  December.For more information about VOYPIC, visit www.voypic.org or search VOYPIC across social media.

Alexander, at just three years of age, passed away on July  this year.“We said at the time that we will be trying to raise as much money as possible to give to the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice,” outlined Lisa.“They were absolutely amazing and need all the support they can get.”Both parents agreed that the public are not aware of the work carried out by the staff at NI Hospice.“The Hospice helped us get through a very dficult time. They supported us and gave us respite when we really needed it. In Alexander’s last days the Hospice staff worked very hard. We know we could not have got through without their excellent backing. We say a very special thank you for everything they did. Words cannot really describe just how good their were. We are, and always will be, most grateful to them,” outlined Lisa.Alexander’s condition deteriorated towards the end of June this year - and in the end Hospice staff worked one-to-one making things as comfortable as possible for him.At present the Halax Bank in Bryan Street in the town, where Lisa works, are organising a collection for Hospice.“People have been very kind.

Flexibility would be available on parental request and would not involve an educational assessment.Launching the consultation last month, the Education Minister said: “I am fully committed to introducing greater flexibility in school starting age and I understand that this is a genuine concern for parents of children born later in the academic year.“Northern Ireland has excellent schools and a well-regarded play-based curriculum in the early years of primary school. The vast majority of children regardless of their age within their class thrive at primary school.“However, some parents feel that starting school shortly after their fourth birthday is not right for their very young child. They have concerns around issues such as social skills, emotional readiness, the longer school day and independence in personal care.”The consultation period is scheduled to run until January .Related topicsMichelle McIlveenDepartment of EducationJohn O#DowdMore On Michelle McIlveenNo surprise at rise in infected pupils, says expert amid concern over holding of transfer testsDisaster warning: Teaching union calls for December school ‘circuit breaker’ after , off with CovidDepartment reiterates its commitment to relationships and sex education review PremiumStormont ministers attend events despite their work from home message PremiumViewpointOpinionWhat is it we want from the elected Most ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenNI taxi driver handed suspended sentence after sharing sex act video in WhatsApp groupMichael O’Neill explains ‘respectful’ anthem compromise that his Northern Ireland teams reachedLidl gets green light for three new NI storesFuneral of Tierna Campbellwho was found dead in Ballynahinch flat held on WednesdayTop VideosPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayBallywalter pier has been seriously damaged by Storm BarraPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest EducationNI classroom assistants ‘under pressure’ to plug teaching gapsCall for urgent change to address school unorm costNI teachers #in tears# dealing with Covid crisis in schoolsBrain drain blamed on Northern Ireland’s political ideAlan HutchinsonOpinionIf we’d had one teacher less, normal classes would have been impossibleLatestRalph Hasenhuttl happy to throw Willy Caballero into action against ArsenalNo big changes to coronavirus rules planned this week, Welsh Government revealsPM: Voters have every right to cast me down and outMade sales hit by up to £m after factory closures and shipping delaysMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling average,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

for northern ireland being considered to tackle omicron variant","story":"The First Minister Paul Givan has said that “scenario planning” has begun on a range of options that the Executive are considering in order to deal with the Omicron iant “in a measured way”.Speaking at a press conference at Stormont on Thursday morning, Mr Givan said that, come the New Year, the Omicron iant will inevitably become the dominant strain.“Scientic experts have said that the new iant is highly transmissible, which is a cause for concern,” he said.“Experts are concerned of the doubling rate of between two and three days and that is going to have an impact.”Read More‘Christmas is on, but we need to be careful about it’, says Robin SwannThe First Minister added that Northern Ireland is, however, currently “behind the curve”.“We don’t need to be panicking but we do need to recognise that what we are being advised that this new iant is going to become a challenge for us in Northern Ireland early in new year and we need to be ready for that,” he said.“Preparation is taking place, that’s what some of discussion at the Executive today will be, so we will have all of this thought through in terms of what is necessary and look at a range of scenarios, but we hope that we will not have to do anything.”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill echoed these remarks.She said: “We want to avoid introducing restrictions, we want to keep things open, we want to keep people safe and keep the pressure off the health service but ultimately I think it’s inevitable that at some point the Omicron iant is going to cause dficulties for our health service but also economically because I think it is going to interrupt livesit spreads in the way which it potentially can and evidence shows from where that it will spread rapidly so that will have an impact in terms of services I would imagine.”The First Minister said that the public should “not be distracted” with the controversy surrounding a potential Christmas party at  Downing Street last year.“The public should continue to listen to the advice being given and cut through the noise,” said Mr Givan.“The issue over what is happening in Westminster is an unhelpful distraction and it does undermine people’s credibility.”He added that he is appealing for people to “adhere to those baseline measures that we kept in place” and that “we don’t want to enforce our way out of it” and that any enforcement lies with the Justice Minister.The Deputy First Minister said that it is about relying on the “goodwill” of the public.“You won’t police your way out of the pandemic,” she said.“We’re asking for goodwill from the public and they have demonstrated that time and time again, so we are asking for that again.”Read

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

In keeping with Council’s LiveSmart campaign, we want to encourage people to reuse and recycle where they can, and our toy appeal is a great example of this in action.” By donating good quality items, you are making a positive dference to the local environment while helping to share some Christmas joy. Items which can be donated include bicycles, scooters, outdoor seesaws or slides, boardgames, jigsaws, books, dolls, robots, or any plastic or wooden toys. Soft toys, such as teddy bears, cannot be accepted. All toys will be distributed to local families so please ensure your donations are in good working order and excellent condition. A good way to think about this, and indeed any donation to a charity shop or appeal, is to ask yourself would this be something you would accept and use yourself  If you are in a position to support people within your community this Christmas through the toy appeal, please book a slot to attend Limavady Recycling Centre via our website or ring .Staff will be on hand to direct you to the correct container.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

John Hume was widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and one of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace process. The prizes to his name include the Nobel Peace Prize , the Martin Luther King Jnr Non-Violent Awardand the International Gandhi Peace Prize . His we Pat led the announcement and following her recent passing it is the continued wish of the Hume family and Foundation that they be loaned to and displayed in the city. Chair of the Business and Culture Committee, Councillor Conor Heaney, welcomed the key stage in the process of having the items displayed in the city. I am pleased that we have been able to approve the funding for the display of the John Hume Peace Awards in the Guildhall so that the public can view these internationally signicant items, he said. John is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and was one of the architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. He is the only person in the world to have received all three of these awards and their prominent display will give just recognition to that achievement and add to our offering to visitors to our City and District. The paper was presented by Head of Culture at Council,AeidinMcCarter, who added: The Hume Family wish for as many people to see the collection on display as possible and it has been agreed that the Guildhall will be the most appropriate and fitting venue to display them in. Theyare expected to go on display later next year. Speaking at the Committee meeting yesterday, SDLP councillor Rory Farrell said: This is a fantastic gt from the Humefamily to the people of this city. John and Pat are sadly no longer with us,but their legacy lives. Their legacy ispeace, it’s peaceful change. It’s the power of dialogue over violence and John in particular was widelyrecognised and revered for hiscontribution to peace on this island. Hes the only person in historyto be awarded the three big peace prizes and the Humes family have loaned thosethree prestigious awards to the peopleof this city. So, I think its right andI think its proper that those are awardsare publicly displayed in the Guildhallso locals and visitors alike canappreciate and understandthe magnitude of John and Pat’sachievements.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis. Nor do they seem to be engaged in the action needed to relieve pressure on people across the North.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

She took to Facebook in a search for information about the school after noticing it as she travelled up and down the road. “I had been passing this school every day and was just fascinated by it. I wondered what it was called, when it was up and running, when it closed,” she told the County Derry Post. “Wee country schools like that had generations of families in them, and it was just something I became fixated on. “I wanted to know what it was called, andanyone had any memories or photographs of it. It was really to get a lot of people talking about it. “I wanted to stir up a bit of nostalgia among the community that was linked to the school, and was hoping that it would bring a lot of people back in touch with each other. “One lady hilariously came back and said there were some she could do without getting in touch with, and that made me laugh.”  Councillors raise County Derry road issues with DfI officials  Department officials were speaking at a recent full council meeting.   Despite that particular womans reluctance, Julie was able to gather a huge amount of information on the old school, which had been in use for almost  years. Opened in , the school had undergone two extensions in its -year stint, and at the time of its closure, Mr Noel Cunningham, who had links to the RAF, was the principal. A Mrs Carson taught at the school around the same time, while there were two dinner ladies named Bertha Clarke and Greta McKinney. Julie said she had been contacted by  past pupils of the school during her search for its history. “I ordinarily wouldnt have been out this road, but now being on it every day, I see it, so I thought Id put it out and seewe got anything back,” she said. “People were putting up messages, tagging people and asking Is this the school you were at  and I wondered how long it has been since those people were in touch with each other. “I thought it was a really lovely site a quaint country school, and there arent many of them around. I know its up for sale so I thought Id like to know the history before anything happens to it.” The derelict site at Killure PS. Despite the relatively recent closure of the school, photographs have proved dficult to come by for Julie, with just one unearthed so far. She is appealing for anyone with information or photographs to get in touch with her via the Derry Post to pass on what they know. “If anybody had photographs it would be a lovely thing for me to be able to share with everybody,” she said. “It was just to see what I could get back about it for them. I dont know these people I dont know any of them, but theyve all been so lovely in coming back to me. “Surely to goodness, after all thatof time, the papers would have covered a school like that closing ” If you have any information or photographs relating to Killure School, Drumcoon Road, Aghadowey, get in touch with us via editor@derrypostor give us a call on .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec Email: editor@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry group within the Ulster Farmers Unionhave welcomed the further roll out of a local broadband provider into Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Fibrus is currently developing full-fibre infrastructure in rural parts of Northern Ireland, and as part of the process, has struck up a partnership with the UFU. The company became affinity partners of the UFU, meaning their members are able to avail of special rates for its broadband services. James Graham, Group Manager of the South Derry Londonderry UFU said full-fibre broadband would have a major impact on how farmers in the area live and work. “Having access to effective and efficient connectivity services is now essential to those working in our industry,” he said. “This new network will help boost our mission at UFU to support a vibrant and sustainable farming economy. “Modern farming practices and administrative processes have become increasingly digitalised, so connectivity has quickly become a crucial utility on our farms. “We have secured an excellent deal with Fibrus which is available to all our members, so we hope many of them take up this beneficial opportunity - as I have already.”  INTERVIEW: Cllr McPeake: Broadband is a priority  The Mid Ulster councillor says Project Stratum needs to be carefully managed.  Liam Tunney speaks to local Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake about council pragmatism, his role models and helping St Brigids Mayogall go viral last year.   The live network was launched last week in Magherafelt, and Fibrus Brand and Marketing Manager Joe Diver said rural regions had been living in the digital darkness. “That’s why we are committed to connecting communities and equipping families and rural businesses - whether SMEs or farming businesses - with the tools to thrive in modern times,” he said. “We are already making our way across Northern Ireland, transforming connectivity in these areas and addressing the digital imbalance that exists between urban and rural. “Working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union has helped us to identy ways to support local farms and agri-businesses specically, which we know make up a major portion of rural economies. “We’re delighted to now be live in Mid Ulster and look forward to seeing those who need it most, reap the benefits of our hyperfast broadband services.” For more information on the work of Fibrus and the Ulster Farmers’ Union partnership, visit www.fibrus ufu.

Rose Ayling-Ellis is making history as the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly Come Dancing, and information officer for the charity, Pauline Doherty last night heaped praise on the -year-old dancer.  “It is great to see Deaf Culture being recognised. Deaf Awareness and sign language shouldbe taughtto everyonein schools,” she said. In a recent episode, Rose and her partner Giovanni danced a section of their performance without any music and Pauline found that moment very important for the Deaf community. “When Rosie danced with no music to show hearing people what Rosie was feeling, it was fantastic,” said Ms. Doherty. Rose has been an inspiration to young people all over the UK and the Dungiven based charity have been unequivocal in their praise for young dancer. “Rose is fantastic, I love watching her and I really hopes she wins,” said Wendy Cassidy, cleaner at Hands That Talk. Paddy Bradley the caretaker smiled and said “Yes, Rose is very good. It’s nice to see Deaf people on TV,” he added.

She cannot wait to see Rose every week, and she hopes Rose will win it,” he said.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis.

He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money. The boat is excellent, but we tried to lighten it as much as possible in order to make easier. Even so, we are putting in enough food and water to last a minimum of  days, plus our clothes and sleeping gear.The boat will also carry navigation and safety equipment, plus satellite phones to keep in touch with their loved ones and other competitors.During the voyage, three crew members will be rowing at any time, while the other two are resting, and safety harnesses will be worn at all times.ldquoWersquove trained hard and prepared well and I know that racing two kilometres in a skf race bears no comparison with what lies ahead, but wersquore all looking forward to the race, Clive added.Clive and his team-mates are hoping to raise pound, for the Reverse Rett charity, which supports children with Rett Syndrome, a neurological degenerative disease.Anyone wishing to make a donation is asked to go to visit https:www.justgiving fundraising ross-mckinney.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 12%2C 2001  ","story":"SAINTFIELD ndash Saintfield is in line for a new multi-million pound hotel development which is set to create up to  jobs.

early in the second half to take the score to -, the win looked a formality.But as is so often the case at Ballymacarn Park it proved dficult to play with the conditions and some poor decision making and wayward kicking kept inviting Dromore on to the counter-attack.They duly obliged with two quick converted tries to take a - lead and suddenly there was a game on again.Keith Dickson put the home team ahead again with a try and Matthew Nortonrsquos third conversion of the day meant that Dromore had to find another try to regain the lead.As the game headed into the closing minutes the visitors managed to cross the Hinch line and looked set to claim a famous victory as they lead - going into injury time.However, indiscipline was to cost them as they gave away a penalty at the death.Ballynahinch spurned the chance of a draw and kicked for the corner to go for glory and Conor Phillips delivered the winning score in the opposite corner to win a great match.The quarter-finals draw contains most of the big names but Ballynahinch will be full of confidence going forward.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Conor Piper, Harry McCormick, Stuart Evans, Matthew Connolly, Keith Dickson,

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances. However, the Magpies led by four on referee Niall Cullenrsquos short whistle.Ramor came out after the break and pressed high, and were rewarded with three scores in the first five minutes.Kilcoo didnrsquot panic and upped the ante immediately with two Paul Devlin frees settling things. Jerome Johnston and Eugene Branagan kept the scoreboard ticking and on the th minute the brilliant Ceilum Doherty found the net after great approach play by Dylan Ward.From here to the end, Kilcoo kept playing with that high tempo and the game was put beyond the Virginia men with six minutes remaining when man of the match Jerome Johnston found the net once again.Both sides emptied their benches as the game petered out, as the Down men came away with an impressive win.Mickey Moran and his management team will take great heart from many aspects of their teamrsquos performance and will know only too well it will take this and morethey are to win against the Derry champions and reach back-to-back Ulster finals.Kilcoo assistant manager Conleith Gilligan expressed mixed emotions as the local side look ahead to the semi-final stage.ldquoThere was definitely some nice passages of play and, look, we were able to play the game at our own pace and as the competition goes on that wonrsquot be allowed to happen, he said.ldquoOnce we got our legs moving, up to the first water-break we did very well.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their future is terrying.”During his career, James competed in several athletic categories and won two gold medals for Great Britain at the  New York Paralympics. He denied he had caused a public nuisance. Extinction Rebellion’s occupation of London City Airport was designed to highlight the climate impact of air travel.The most energy-intensive activity an inidual can undertake, no other human activity consumes as much energy in such a short time.Mile for mile, flying is the most climate-damaging way to travel.Extinction Rebellion has a number of cases going through the Crown Courts.James’s was the fourth jury trial, and followed the acquittal in April  of six people for criminal damage to Shell’s London HQ, despite all but one having no defence in law.In July this year, the UK government published its Jet Zero strategy to achieve net zero in the aviation industry by .Air travel is an elite activity.Only a tiny percentage of the global population can afford to fly and they have a disproportionate carbon footprint.Taking a long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than the average person in dozens of countries around the world produces in a whole year.The government has repeatedly been advised by its own Climate Change Committee to limit the growth of aviation in the next  years, starting with a halt to airport expansion.The government’s suggestion, in its Transport Decarbonisation Strategy, that the public can continue to fly since aviation will be carbon neutral by mid-century have been widely ridiculed.The government has recently proposed a reduction in Air Passenger Duty Tax whilst the industry is already estimated to be subsidised by £bn per year.The news comes as the PCSC Bill, which has been widely criticised for seeking to limit the right to protests, s to the House of Lords for amendments.Zoe Blackler, Extinction Rebellion media officerFor more letters, opinion pieces, and News Letter editorials, go to this link:gt www.newsletter news opinion lt——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Feebly, Simon Bryne last December buckled in face of ombudsman criticism of the handling of Black Lives Matter protests that June.

Everyone will want to meet with close family and friends and it’s important that people make informed decisions about that, and thatthey are meeting that they do so safely.“We all know the things that we can be doing to make those meetings safer. That is about getting vaccinated and getting our boosters once it’s our turn, and it is about wearing face coverings when we’re meeting indoors, and that it’s well ventillated.“Nobody invites me to parties any more so I shall be spending my time with my close family.”Northern Ireland’s Chief Scientic Advisor, Professor Ian Young, added: “I think it’s really important that we adhere to the guidelines that are in place. If meeting family and friends and socialising is important, as it is to many people, then I think it’s appropriate that we should do that.“If you do see me at any parties over the Christmas period, you’ll notice me staying near the window as much as possible and I can guarantee you I will have taken a lateral flow test beforehand.”Prof McBride, meanwhile, said it is important the rules apply equally to everyone following the furore surrounding reports of multiple reports of Christmas parties at Downing Street while the UK was still under lockdown.Sir Michael said: “I don’t know what went on or didn’t go on, but what I can say is there is no rule for one and dferent rules for everyone . These rules are there for all of us and it is in everyone’s best interests.“This is about controlling the pandemic, a pandemic that has taken a signicant toll in terms of lives lost and livelihoods impacted upon.”He added: “It’s particularly important that everyone abides by the rules and follows the regulations. “I think it’s important that the public see that we practice what we preach.”Paul GivanMichelle ONeillNorthern IrelandStormont Executive  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularSinn Fein rising star quit over paymentsFuneral details released for tragic dad Aaron Harkin | ‘you had the biggest, kindest, caring heart’ | ‘a le taken too soon’Donaldson repeats threat to bring down StormontThe ‘gradualism’ of the Northern Ireland Protocol fits the Irish republican strategyBook extract: There is silence among the Irish about their relocation to BritainMost PopularAldi releases two festive gin liqueurs for Christmas, including a Spiced Biscuit flavour - how to buy best men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK: stay dry hiking with trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, MontaneChristmas toys : popular toys expected to sell out this Xmas - including Paw Patrol and a fidget popperFood and drink gts: best Christmas food and drink hampers from Marks and Spencer, Aldi and Hotel Chocolat MS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale now                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm. Bidders will have a full  hours to take part in the auction and place their bids, as the bidding will time out at pm on Friday, December .

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

Last week saw the completion of the booster programme to those in Supported Living accommodation, those attending Adult Learning Disability Day Care Centres, and those who are homeless. Residents, service-users in the community, and staff who were eligible for the vaccine booster received their jab at a total of  facilities spread right across the Western Trust area. Karen Hargan, Western Trust HR Director and Vaccination Programme Lead, said the programme just completed is testament to the Trust’s commitment to looking after some of the most vulnerable citizens in our community. “As a Trust, we are dealing with an ever-changing situation when it comes to vaccinations. As new iants come to light, and transmission rates alter, we have to adapt our plans accordingly. But one of our key priorities will always be to look after our most vulnerable citizens to ensure that they do not miss out, are protected from this virus, and are not left behind. “I would like to personally offer my thanks to all of the owners of these facilities and their staff for helping us to deliver this programme, and of course to our highly skilled and extremely dedicated vaccination teams, without whom programmes like these simply would not be possible.” For the latest information on the Western Trust’s vaccination programme please visit the Western Trust Vaccination Info page.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acdeeed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccbedafaebfbedeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638984916407.jpg--covid_19___wed_8th_december_figures.jpg?163898491600","title":"covid  wed th december figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
