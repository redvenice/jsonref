It will create it.\u0027  ALEX BRUMMER: Why the EU always haggles like an aggressive market trader… then CAVES IN  Long before the British people voted to leave the EU in the referendum, before the term Brexit had even been coined, it was Grexit that was preoccupying the minds of Eurocrats.Greece came close to crashing out of the single currency on at least four occasions after a vast black hole opened up in the country’s accounts in 2009.At one stage, in 2012, the British banknote printers De La Rue was asked by the government in Athens to make contingency plans to print new drachma notes (Greece’s pre-euro currency) in preparation for what many called the ‘Double D’ solution to Greek economic problems – default on the country’s debt and devaluation with the return of the drachma.Today, Greece remains one of the 17 members of the eurozone – and that fact alone should lift Theresa May’s spirits as, armed with her newly acquired parliamentary majority, she returns to Brussels seeking at the very least to put a time limit on the backstop deal she signed up to for the Irish border.Each time a Greek default loomed into view, threatening the stability of the eurozone and raising the possibility that Italy or one of the other member countries might also head for the exit, the main protagonists – the hard-line German-dominated European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt and the European Commission in Brussels – caved in and authorised a bailout.          President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (left) and the European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union Michel Barnier (right)Last-ditch negotiations, usually conducted over a weekend when the financial markets were closed, would typically stretch into the early hours.Late-night deals were hatched against a backdrop of TV screens showing central Athens on fire and anti-austerity protesters ripping up flagstones in the capital’s Syntagma Square.The first £38billion bailout was agreed in the dead of night on April 23, 2010, by the troika of the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. It was one of several rescue packages for Greece, some of which required a change of government to get them over the line.What happened to Greece is typical of the Eurocrat tendency to fudge, to muddy the waters and eventually to seek compromise in a crisis situation.Indeed, the history of the EU is littered with examples of Britain locked into eleventh-hour talks with eurocrats as the UK has sought changes in our terms of membership.John Major worked through the night in 1991 to secure Britain’s opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty which would have dictated working conditions in Britain and could have undermined the labour market reforms pioneered by his predecessor Margaret Thatcher. Indeed, she was a fierce negotiator in organising rebates from Brussels from the UK’s oversized contributions to the EU budget.In 1984, in the imperial grandeur at the historic palace of Fontainebleau in France, European leaders painfully conceded the famous British EU budget contribution rebate – or, as the French sarcastically called it, ‘le chèque Britannique’.          A new poll reveals voters support May going for talks with the EU but only one in three believe she will be successfulAnd let’s not forget that in the teeth of his promise to hold an inout referendum, David Cameron returned from Brussels in the early hours one day in February 2016 with draft reform proposals agreed by European Council President Donald Tusk which he claimed would give Britain ‘special status’.In the event, the pledges made by Brussels were so anaemic that they failed to convince British voters that sovereignty could be maintained by voting Remain – a huge mistake by the eurocrats who failed to recognise the strength of anti-EU feeling among large swathes of the UK population.Both in national negotiations and in commercial transactions, reaching an accord more often or not comes down to the wire. Today, with the clock ticking inexorably to March 29, the desperation of the leaders of the other 27 EU countries to avoid an economic and financial crisis at the very moment that Germany and the eurozone are facing the bleak prospect of recession may be Theresa May’s best hope.This is regardless of how unyielding Brussels negotiators have been to date and their willingness to play havoc with business confidence and financial stability by its brinkmanship.The potential loss to Brussels of a £39billion one-off payment to a Commission cash-starved following years of economic slowdown, could potentially be a bargaining chip for the Prime Minister in the last-chance saloon.In the final analysis, as veteran witnesses of the late-night sessions in Brussels, Nice, Maastricht and other destinations tell me, it’s mainly Germany and, to a lesser extent, France which decide.Besieged by increasingly hostile populist movements, neither Berlin or Paris will want to make political life tougher than it already is.The politics of the EU, at their most raw, are little different to those of the bazaar. The natural tendency is to relish an aggressive haggle but then to compromise – eventually.   "},{"url":null,"title":"How weeks dithering bricks use helped push cost new EastEnders set","story":"    The Carter family outside the Queen Vic pub.

It was the right thing to do.’The bricks must be tinted, moss must be applied, and the peeling paint outside the Queen Vic pub will be recreated to mimic the current set.The soap’s existing set was built in 1984 using steel frames, plywood and plaster brick panels with the intention that it would be used for two years.

There is no other choice.‘If you want to be a shining star at the BBC, you are going to have to follow this course of action.’Asked whether he accepted this, Lord Hall said: ‘Yes I acknowledge that. People were pushed into these things. We’re saying that we’ve accepted responsibility. That’s full responsibility.’The BBC previously stood by a 2012 report published by Deloitte, which found ‘no evidence of any pressure to move staff to the PSC arrangements’.But yesterday Lord Hall and his deputy director-general, Anne Bulford, accepted that there was pressure regardless.Lord Hall said: ‘Going back and trying to find records of how these PSCs were set up and people’s correspondence with the BBC about them - we can’t find any record which point to one way or the other.‘But the evidence from people I’ve talked to is... that they were asked to take up PSCs’."},{"url":null,"title":"Dirty Duchess Argyll subject TV drama","story":"    Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, is pictured outside the law courts in London in 1960 during what became a famous orce caseA British aristocrat known as the \u0027Dirty Duchess\u0027 of Argyll - whose husband accused her of sleeping with up to 88 men including government ministers and royals - will be the subject of a TV drama. The mini-series about Margaret Campbell, whose sex scandal made headlines in 1963, will be a spin-off of the BBC\u0027s award-winning A Very English Scandal. The Duchess\u0027s orce ignited public speculation when a list emerged of more than 80 men she had reportedly slept with, said to include two ministers and three members of the royal family. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said the scandal made her the first woman to be publicly \u0027slut shamed\u0027.  Granting the orce, presiding judge Lord Wheatley said she \u0027was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men\u0027.The Duchess was the third wife of Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, whose family owned Inveraray Castle in western Scotland. Born Margaret Whigham, she married wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933, having three children with him. Sorry ladies, the nation has voted for its greatest icons of...Great British Bake Off star Nadiya opens up about her...Share this articleAfter orcing him in 1947 she married the Duke in 1951 but the marriage fell apart after her suspicious husband hired a locksmith to break open a cupboard at her house in Mayfair. The search allegedly uncovered love letters and polaroid photos of her engaging in sexual acts with her various partners.           First marriage: The Duchess of Argyll on her wedding day after marrying wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933           Second marriage: Margaret on the day she became Duchess of Argyll, after marrying Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, at Caxton Hall in London in March 1951  Margaret Campbell is pictured left at Inveraray Castle in Scotland in 1953 and right at a party in 1961.

But it will allow Murray to live pain-free and it could open the door to him becoming a tennis coach after he retires.    Murray had previously said ahead of the Australian Open earlier this month that he intended to retire after this year\u0027s WimbledonMurray was set for a farewell six months after emotionally announcing he was in too much pain to carry on in the build up to the first grand slam of the year.After losing to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, he said: ‘Tonight was not comfortable in terms of my hip. At the end, I’m really struggling, I can’t walk properly at all just now.\u0027I could play another match, but if I want to try to play again, I want to improve my quality of life, because even if I take four months I still can’t walk. I’m still in pain doing just basic day-to-day things.’ But the monumental five-set tussle showed the Scot still has the ability and desire to compete at the top level, and he said he would do everything he could to keep playing. Having the surgery, which happened in London on Monday, means he might not be fit to take part in Wimbledon this summer, where he had planned to say goodbye to the sport.And if it does not allow him to return to the court, he will have played the last game of his glittering career.In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer.Mr Bryan has said: ‘Seeing the way Andy Murray is feeling hit a nerve with me. I would love to see him do a similar surgery, feel the relief that it gives. I think our hips are pretty similar – just worn down, no cartilage.‘I’m really the only guy to be playing on with a metal hip. So he’s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I’m feeling after matches, after practices, where I’m at.’    Murray admitted being in pain during the Australian Open this month (pictured there)   A graphic shows how Murray\u0027s hip resurfacing procedure was carried out in hospital Murray had his first hip operation in Australia in January last year. It was carried out by Dr John O’Donnell, who is regarded as one of the leading experts in hip arthroscopy.  Under a resurfacing procedure, damaged bone and cartilage inside a patient’s hip joint are removed and replaced with a metal ‘dome’ surface.Typically patients spend two or three days in hospital and should be walking again soon afterwards.The ATP Tour tweeted support for Murray, posting: ‘Yesterday Andy Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery in London.

Here, Beth Hale reveals the stories behind some of the iconic frocks on show.The creation fit for a princess   She called it her ‘favourite dress of all’.And in the flesh, the fabulous fairytale gown Princess Margaret wore to mark her 21st birthday — both her birthday party in August 1951 and portraits — is indeed a dress of dreams.While the diaphanous skirt is not quite as voluminous as photographs suggest and the colour an off-white rather than the lighter, brighter colour of the famous Cecil Beaton photographs, the dress is the kind of flouncing, bare-shouldered perfection that little girls imagine when they dream of princesses (although Margaret’s father George VI was rumoured to have disapproved of it).          Royal Portrait of Princess Margaret on her 21st birthday by Cecil Beaton in a dress designed by Christian Dior, part of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the London attraction which runs from February 2 to 14 JulyThe differences are not due to any deterioration in fabric, but rather that the colour version of the portrait was actually painted.Even in the Fifties photographers were not averse to a little creative license.With a waist of miniature proportions (no measurement is provided, but it has to be less than 20 inches), the gown shows quite how petite the princess was.Dr Luke says Lady Gaga accused him of rape to win an Oscar...JANET STREET-PORTER: Sorry, Piers but I\u0027m with Will Young -...Could the queen of clean turn me into a domestic god?: MARK...Share this articleMargaret’s son, Lord Snowdon, was at the V\u0026ampA gala dinner to celebrate the exhibition and gave a toast, recalling how surprised he was to find his mother’s dress in the show. He said: ‘I had never seen it before and couldn’t believe that it has survived all these years and been conserved.‘Interestingly, the Cecil Beaton photograph of her shows the dress looking white when in reality it is between cream and beige. It was moving to see the dress that she wore all those years ago with its tiny waist and extraordinary lines, typical of Dior who made such a genius contribution to fashion.’          Princess Diana arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Diana was attending the Museum\u0027s 1996 Costume Insitute gala, a tribute to the achievements of designer Christian DiorLord Snowdon, whose wife Serena was dressed in Dior, added: ‘This is an important exhibition for Britain, with an Anglophile designer who showed such elegance and eloquence in fashion design.’Dior admired Princess Margaret’s style, describing her as ‘so very charming’.‘She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,’ he would later write. In 1957, Dior presented the princess with a signed silk scarf in appreciation of her support, while she was a loyal customer for years.Gown almost too daring for Diana It was 1996 and Princess Diana walked into the biggest event on the fashion industry calendar in a dress that was at once ravishing and racy.So racy, in fact, Diana very nearly didn’t wear the dress to New York’s Met Gala for fear Prince William, then 14, wouldn’t like it being so revealing.Brit John Galliano had just been appointed creative director at the fashion house, and designed the dress for Diana before turning his mind to his first collection.A navy silk slip dress, with lace straps and edging, it had more than a hint of the boudoir about it and was a bold choice from Diana, who was then 35.She stopped the fashion crowd dead in their tracks, Liz Tilberis, editor of Harper’s Bazaar, would later write.A statement look for every star  From Margot Fonteyn to Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson, the house of Dior has dressed stars in abundance.At the start they were drawn to the designer’s famed Bar suit — part of his 1947 ‘Corolle’ collection. Crafted from shantung silk, crepe wool and taffeta, it has become one of the brand’s most iconic pieces.  Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year (left) and Nicole Kidman in a beaded gown at Cannes (right)Ballet dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn was one of Christian Dior’s early muses and the exhibition features two dresses she wore, including a 1950 evening gown named ‘Debussy’, made of silk satin with hundreds of dragonfly sequins.Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year.           Naomi Campbell pictured in Dior in 1997There’s also the silk confection Jennifer Lawrence wore to a film premiere in September 2017, a beaded gown worn by Nicole Kidman in Cannes  — and many more.Fashion firebrands who kept his name alive   A string of illustrious names followed in Dior’s footsteps.First came a 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent, whose early designs were so strikingly similar to his illustrious predecessor that when he sent them to French Elle magazine, the then editor thought it was Dior playing tricks.Next came Marc Bohan — he assumed the helm until 1989.Italian Gianfranco Ferré became the first non-French artistic director, until 1996 when controversial Brit John Galliano took over — supermodel Naomi Campbell is pictured in one of his typically flamboyant designs in 1997.His reign came to a rather ignominious end when he was sacked in 2011, paving the way for Raf Simons and finally Maria Grazia Chiuri, the second Italian and first woman, appointed in July 2016.Anglophile and his blue-blooded fans   Christian Dior first visited the UK in 1926 and was something of an Anglophile. He admired the grandeur of Britain’s great stately homes and gardens, as well as British-designed ocean liners, roast beef and Savile Row suits.Dior’s chic little black suits of the 1940s and 1950s were beloved by the British aristocracy, and muses Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn both ordered his 1947 ‘Daisy’ suit.Mitford wrote to her sister Diana Mosley later that year, of Dior’s second collection: ‘Now I’m nearly 50 I’ve decided to choose a style and stick to it and I choose Dior’s present collection. Simply, to my mind, perfect.’          Christian Dior (left) became an Anglophile after visiting Britain in 1926 and his suits were beloved by the British aristocracy           Charlize Theron has been the face of J\u0027Adore by Dior since 2004‘I adore the English,’ Dior wrote in his memoir.‘I love English traditions, English politeness, English architecture, I even love English cooking!\u0027I dote on Yorkshire pudding, mince pies, stuffed chicken, and above all I worship the English breakfast of tea, porridge, eggs and bacon.’Sweet smell of success    A clever marketer, Christian Dior was a fashion pioneer in more than one respect: he launched a perfume line in 1947, the very same year of his first collection.He very quickly created lipsticks, introduced hats, shoes and even stockings — wanting to provide a ‘one-stop’ service for his well-heeled clients.Latterly, Dior’s perfumes have had a gold theme.In 1999, the fashion house launched J’Adore, a perfume celebrating Christian Dior’s love of glimmering gold.Since 2004, the face of J’Adore has been actress Charlize Theron.The Hollywood beauty has appeared on screen and in print in a series of ever-more dazzling gold gowns, several of which are on display at the V\u0026ampA.They include fashion designer John Galliano’s J’Adore dress from 2008, which was adorned with sequins and Swarovski crystals.Meghan is pretty in peach as she visits the National TheatreWoman shows how to fold clothes using the KonMari methodPaulina Porizkova poses for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit in KenyaDuke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in Dundee to open V\u0026ampA MuseumMeghan Markle arrives at the National Theatre for royal patron debutDuchess of Sussex leaves National Theatre after official engagementLittle ladies and gents who attend etiquette lessons graduateKate Middleton makes a speech and officially opens V\u0026ampA Dundee museumAdorable girl can’t resist touching Kate’s locks in DundeeFather-to-be discovers he has lymphoma by googling symptomsChildren perform for The Duchess of Sussex at the National TheatrePolice at scene where man was stabbed to death in Islington"},{"url":null,"title":"How litter pick swimsuit","story":"Ghirardelli changes its popular Chocolate Squares packaging...Share this article  TRAVELLING BAGS FROM FIRE HOSES In 2005, Kresse Wesling was at an environmental meeting with the London Fire Brigade when they told her that all their old hoses, which are made of nylon, went to landfill.

President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (left) and the European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union Michel Barnier (right)Last-ditch negotiations, usually conducted over a weekend when the financial markets were closed, would typically stretch into the early hours.Late-night deals were hatched against a backdrop of TV screens showing central Athens on fire and anti-austerity protesters ripping up flagstones in the capital’s Syntagma Square.The first £38billion bailout was agreed in the dead of night on April 23, 2010, by the troika of the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. It was one of several rescue packages for Greece, some of which required a change of government to get them over the line.What happened to Greece is typical of the Eurocrat tendency to fudge, to muddy the waters and eventually to seek compromise in a crisis situation.Indeed, the history of the EU is littered with examples of Britain locked into eleventh-hour talks with eurocrats as the UK has sought changes in our terms of membership.John Major worked through the night in 1991 to secure Britain’s opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty which would have dictated working conditions in Britain and could have undermined the labour market reforms pioneered by his predecessor Margaret Thatcher. Indeed, she was a fierce negotiator in organising rebates from Brussels from the UK’s oversized contributions to the EU budget.In 1984, in the imperial grandeur at the historic palace of Fontainebleau in France, European leaders painfully conceded the famous British EU budget contribution rebate – or, as the French sarcastically called it, ‘le chèque Britannique’.          A new poll reveals voters support May going for talks with the EU but only one in three believe she will be successfulAnd let’s not forget that in the teeth of his promise to hold an inout referendum, David Cameron returned from Brussels in the early hours one day in February 2016 with draft reform proposals agreed by European Council President Donald Tusk which he claimed would give Britain ‘special status’.In the event, the pledges made by Brussels were so anaemic that they failed to convince British voters that sovereignty could be maintained by voting Remain – a huge mistake by the eurocrats who failed to recognise the strength of anti-EU feeling among large swathes of the UK population.Both in national negotiations and in commercial transactions, reaching an accord more often or not comes down to the wire. Today, with the clock ticking inexorably to March 29, the desperation of the leaders of the other 27 EU countries to avoid an economic and financial crisis at the very moment that Germany and the eurozone are facing the bleak prospect of recession may be Theresa May’s best hope.This is regardless of how unyielding Brussels negotiators have been to date and their willingness to play havoc with business confidence and financial stability by its brinkmanship.The potential loss to Brussels of a £39billion one-off payment to a Commission cash-starved following years of economic slowdown, could potentially be a bargaining chip for the Prime Minister in the last-chance saloon.In the final analysis, as veteran witnesses of the late-night sessions in Brussels, Nice, Maastricht and other destinations tell me, it’s mainly Germany and, to a lesser extent, France which decide.Besieged by increasingly hostile populist movements, neither Berlin or Paris will want to make political life tougher than it already is.The politics of the EU, at their most raw, are little different to those of the bazaar. The natural tendency is to relish an aggressive haggle but then to compromise – eventually.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Ups downs life bookshop Chinese store leaves customers stairway literary heaven","story":"    The mirrored ceilings give the illusion of the room never ending much to the amusement of the many hundreds of visitors every day          The stairways which travel up and down, across the rooms, are as attractive to visitors as the thousands of books on the walls          The modern library now attracts as many visitors hoping to photograph it as it does book lovers hoping to find a new read          Photographers stop in the centre to attempt a perfect shot at the bookstore which is packed with optical illusions and even an enchanted mushroom forest for children           Mirrored ceilings give the impression of the book shelves being double the height.

Secondary school...Share this articleThe Ucas data on offers to 18-year-olds in 2018, released today, shows 50 universities made at least 10 per cent of their offers unconditionally.Of those, 22 made such offers to at least 30 per cent, and 10 made them to at least 50 per cent.The highest proportion was at the University of Suffolk, which had 83 per cent unconditional offers.It was followed by York St John, with 78 per cent, and then Bolton, which had 75 per cent.Meanwhile, Roehampton had 68 per cent Southampton Solent had 58 per cent Bishop Grosseteste had 56 per cent and Gloucestershire had 56 per cent.The other universities were Northampton, Lincoln and Plymouth Marjon.Some of these universities specialise in niche subjects such as art and health, which are heavily reliant on portfolios or interviews and do not necessarily require good exam grades.However, many of them also offer mainstream courses in subjects such as English and history.          Happy students: But recent research has shown applicants who accept an unconditional offer are more likely to miss their predicted A Level results by two or more gradesThe data prompted the Office for Students (OfS) to warn universities they must mend their ways.Chief executive Nicola Dandridge said: ‘There are some good reasons why universities might make unconditional offers.‘However, for a number of universities this data will make uncomfortable reading - where they cannot justify the offers they make they should reconsider their approach.’ Among the universities making more than 10 per cent unconditional offers were two elite institutions of the Russell Group - Nottingham and Birmingham.Yesterday, Nottingham announced it would no longer make such offers from this year onwards, following a backlash over the past year.Registrar Dr Paul Greatrix said of the move: ‘We want everyone to be fully confident that they are admitted purely on their merits and potential.’ However, the majority of those favouring unconditional offers were non-elite, ‘low tariff’ universities, which tend to admit lower-performing students.Experts have speculated in the past they may be resorting to these measures to get ‘bums on seats’ if they are less popular and fewer pupils are competing to gain entry.The data released yesterday also showed universities in England were responsible for most of the unconditional offer-making, followed by Wales.It was very uncommon in Scotland, partly because universities do not have to compete for students in the same way, as student numbers are capped and tuition is free.Around half of all unconditional offers had a proviso attached to them - usually that the student had to list the university as their first choice on their Ucas form.When contacted for comment, the University of Suffolk said unconditional offers helped it focus on ‘widening participation’ as it took in the students’ ‘potential to succeed’ in addition to predicted grades.It said it had ‘not adversely affected our applicant profile’ in terms of A-level grades.Meanwhile, Northampton said it ‘does not offer an unconditional place in exchange for an applicant making a decision on the spot’ and ‘explains to all applicants who receive an unconditional offer that their pre-university grades are likely to impact their future career.’ Lincoln said those who receive unconditional offers ‘outperform their peers’, while Plymouth Marjon and Bolton said they had discontinued unconditional offers for 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"PAUL THOMAS negotiating Brussels","story":"Welcome to the 2020 election: One third of the electorate...Smartphone users spend £800million on mobile data they never...Ups and downs of life in a bookshop: Chinese store leaves...Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"300 000 Thatcher statue 10ft plinth deter vandals","story":"    Artist\u0027s impression: With a 3.2m sculpture atop a 3.2m plinth, the proposed statue would dominate the quiet town square in GranthamA report to South Kesteven District Council states that there is not felt to be a significant threat to the installation of the statue locally.However, it adds: \u0027In general there remains a motivated far-left movement across the UK... who may be committed to public activism.\u0027It still remains that there is a possibility any public statue of Baroness Thatcher would be a likely target for politically-motivated vandals.\u0027The report to members will go before South Kesteven district councillors next Tuesday.Fury as organisers of the London\u0027s Women\u0027s March call female...\u0027Monster of Brussels\u0027 tipped as UK ambassador to be based in...Share this articleIn a bid to avoid the statue being attacked it recommends it should be placed on a \u0027sufficiently high plinth and in easy view.\u0027It states \u0027the statue, to go on St Peter\u0027s Hill, will be placed on a 3.2 metre high plinth, and will be over 6.4 metres tall in total.\u0027St Peter\u0027s Hill is a green space in the heart of Grantham town centre and is already home to a statue of Sir Isaac Newton who attended King\u0027s Grammar School in Grantham.Grantham adopted the statue after plans to build it on Parliament Square, in London, were previously rejected by Westminster City Council due to the fear of it being targeted by protesters.

There is no other choice.‘If you want to be a shining star at the BBC, you are going to have to follow this course of action.’Asked whether he accepted this, Lord Hall said: ‘Yes I acknowledge that.

It’s all of our jobs to ensure they doOn the face of it, 2018 was a good year for female artists. Museums and galleries across the UK staged exhibitions on historic and contemporary female artists, with events that celebrated 100 years since British women won the right to vote. But now that the bunting has been taken down and the suffragette sashes stowed away, will women still get wall space in our public museums? Are they here to stay or will they have to make way for the next fad?But there is still a long way to go. When the National Gallery acquired Gentileschi’s self-portrait last year, the number of works by female artists in its collection rose from 23 to 24 – out of more than 2,300 in its archives.It’s not that there has been a shortage of female artists – there have been hundreds over the centuries. But, while many were influential during their lifetimes, they fell into posthumous obscurity because museums did not deem it necessary to collect their works. Invisible in museums, they did not sell well on the art market. In turn, museums did not think it necessary to acquire them, producing a vicious cycle of exclusion. How can this deadlock be broken? It’s not just up to museum directors and curators, but also the museum-going public.Last summer, Tate Modern staged two concurrent exhibitions: Picasso 1932: Love, Fame, Tragedy – covering the creative output of a single year in the artist’s life – attracted 521,080 visitors a retrospective covering the six-decade-long career of the contemporary American artist Joan Jonas attracted only 47,876. It seems a pity that more people did not come through the door. Those who did were able to discover an innovative and significant artist, who was a pioneer in the development of the emerging art forms of video and performance.It’s true that two of the most popular exhibitions last year were on female artists: Anni Albers at Tate Modern and Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up at the Victoria and Albert Museum (which sold out almost as fast as Glastonbury). And among this year’s hotly anticipated shows are Tate Modern’s retrospectives on Dora Maar and Dorothea Tanning, and the Barbican’s exhibition on Lee Krasner. But apart from being female, these women have something crucial in common: they were all the wives or girlfriends of famous male artists such as Picasso and Jackson Pollock. Though Kahlo may now be better known than her husband, Diego Rivera, early interest in her work arose purely as a consequence of his. A 1933 newspaper headline about her reads: “Wife of the master mural painter gleefully dabbles in works of art.”Of course, our interest in these women is not only due to curiosity about their love lives. We have greater appreciation for art and artists we are familiar with, so it’s no surprise that our interest in a female artist is enhanced by an understanding of her biography and context.But to ensure that future generations are familiar with more female artists, we need to be adventurous with the exhibitions we visit now. We need to show that exhibitions on little-known female artists (not just male artists’ Wags) can be put on without damaging the financial health of public museums. We need to help our institutions help us, so that our children and grandchildren inherit a fuller, more representative, more female history of art.So now that the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act is over, let’s resolve to make a difference this year. Next time there’s an exhibition on a female artist you don’t know, vote with your feet and go along. Your entrance fee could give her a decisive majority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65afb0b0684a68a969023d515145cc68b33fcb8e/0_6_5842_3506/master/5842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2245004f0de26167ed470712def72113","title":"costa prize winner bart van es on why he had to tell his familys holocaust story","story":"The Cut Out Girl is the gripping tale of a Jewish girl who escaped the Nazis, written by her saviours’ grandson. Here, author and heroine talk about their life-affirming collaboration‘I must tell you a secret,” Lien de Jong’s mother said to her gently one day. “You are going to stay somewhere else for a while.” It was August 1942 in occupied Holland and De Jong was eight years old. The family was Jewish, but not observant. She would never see her parents again they were murdered in Auschwitz six months later. She was sent to live with a non-Jewish family, the Van Eses, the first in a series of temporary homes in the Netherlands’ wartime underground network.Bart van Es is a Dutch-born English literature professor at Oxford University, who usually “writes scholarly books and articles on Shakespeare and Renaissance poetry”. He is also the grandson of Jans and Henk van Es, who, as part of the Dutch resistance, sheltered Jewish children such as Lien de Jong during the occupation. His account of her extraordinary, harrowing story of loss, survival and love, The Cut Out Girl, has just won the Costa Book of the Year award.“I was very amazed,” 85-year-old De Jong says, laughing, the morning after the ceremony. “I thought the young lady would win.”It is true that Rooney’s much-talked-about second novel, Normal People, was the hands-down favourite to take the prize. But The Cut Out Girl was “a hidden gem”, according to Sophie Raworth, chair of the Costa judges. “It was the book we felt everyone should read.”“I think of it as very much a joint book,” Van Es tells De Jong.Arrestingly and simply told, The Cut Out Girl is a powerful addition to memoirs of the Holocaust. It is a whiplash jolt from Rooney’s knowing story of millennial love and angst. “There is something millennial about this, too, in a way,” Van Es suggests. “It’s about modern Europe as well as about the war.” The book interweaves De Jong’s story with Van Es’s travels around the Netherlands – wartime archives, railway and petrol stations, motorways – during which he was struck by the impact of far-right politics there today, with figures such as Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom (PVV) making headlines. “He’s had very significant votes and has really changed the tone of Dutch politics in quite a scary way,” Van Es says.Famed for its tolerance, the Netherlands has “also got its nasty side”. Returning to his grandparents’ house, in what is now an almost entirely Muslim area, he says he felt uncomfortable researching a Jewish story. “It made me think, there’s a danger now that the world is becoming compartmentalised again in echo chambers of people who just tell their own stories. This is a story in one way about a non-Jewish person talking to a Jewish person, but beyond that about a person from the 21st century looking back at the 20th century.” If there is a message to the book, he says, it is that “you have to look beyond yourself, you have to have some larger vision, because in the war the people who acted, who did something for the Jews, were largely people who were part of organisations that ned racial ides, things like my grandparents being part of the socialist movement.”“They were very principled people,” De Jong says. “They didn’t accept injustice in any way.”Although he “always had this sort of background idea, that I’m the family academic and I ought to write this up,” there wasn’t one single trigger that prompted Van Es to begin researching the life of the “lost” Jewish girl who lived with his grandparents during the war, but with whom there was a mysterious rift many years later. He has no memories of De Jong, although she remembers him as a tiny child, and he refers to her as “Aunt” in the book. “I like to say that,” he says, when I ask how they like their relationship to be described.“I never thought about it. You can call me Aunt,” she responds fondly.What was meant to be just a cup of coffee and a sandwich with his “aunt” turned into a 10-hour conversation and then a month-long extended interview, in which he came to know her “in a way that I had never known anybody else. Even with your most intimate contacts, you would never normally say: ‘Tell me your life, your earliest memories what was your room like when you were a little girl?’ It was just an astonishing privilege to have that with another human being. I think that is something that has changed me. It has made me a more empathetic person.”Of their first exchange, De Jong says: “I always thought, ‘I have no special story, so what do you want?’ But talking together, it became a story.”And what a story it is. Her time with the Van Eses, which she refers to as “my first hiding parents”, was a particularly happy one. “That was the only place where I felt safe and could be a child and play with the other children,” she says. But then the knock would come on the door. “It’s funny how much shoes would matter in the time of crisis,” Van Es observes in the book, as she would have to pull on whatever was available and literally run for her life. The succession of hideouts that followed were increasingly unhappy, as she was passed from family to family, treated as a servant in one, and sexually abused in the last. It is striking in the book how De Jong’s memories, so vivid at first, become more vague as she becomes more traumatised. “One of the things the book is about is that you only remember things if you experience them in a community,” Van Es says. Towards the end of the war, De Jong became “almost like a zombie … She lived just in herself, living that was just living she suddenly starts having these enormous gaps where she remembers absolutely nothing.”This, of course, presents something of a challenge to the biographer. And it is here that Van Es pulls off a clever authorial sleight of hand, making De Jong’s story intensely immediate and intimate, only then to concede that she herself can’t recall the details at all. “I wanted to be honest about that,” Van Es explains. “I wanted that sort of trick in the book, so you see it and then you don’t see it. And so I wanted those things to be completely historically correct, which they are. I did research.” For example, during the mass exodus from the village of Bennekom in 1944, a procession of families laden with their belongings, or piled on to carts and wagons, we see the bodies of fly-ridden dead horses and soldiers lying in bomb craters, and are told that De Jong “feels sticky” under the three dresses she is wearing to avoid carrying them. But as Van Es admits: “Of the journey to Ede … she can picture nothing at all.” Instead, he has “patched together” the recollections of the hundreds of others who made the journey, taken either from history books and diaries, or from accounts of people he later interviewed.“So it’s not necessarily Lien wearing three dresses. I will always make it clear that’s a made-up bit.” He wanted it to be not just factually accurate – he even checked the weather reports in newspapers from the time – but also “emotionally true”.How does it feel for De Jong, after all these years, to have the gaps filled in by someone else?“The emotional part is not there anywhere. It’s history for me, the whole story,” she replies. “Sometimes I’m sad about my family, who were lost, all of them most of the time it is in a movie or on TV – just looking at other people I can feel emotion.”Today, she says, she is happy “with my friends and children and grandchildren”. She loves Amsterdam, where she lives, and enjoys being part of its cultural life. “I hope very much that my story can help when we are talking about children who are in a terrible situation these days, without parents or without family, going from one country to another,” she says.On the day of the Dutch publication of the book, which also happened to be De Jong’s 85th birthday, they appeared on a TV chatshow. The discussion centered on two Armenian children who were due to be deported back “home” in two days, despite having spent their whole lives with Dutch foster parents and speaking only Dutch. “It was really shocking that the government was saying: ‘We are going to send these children back,’” says Van Es. The following day a decision was made to allow the children to stay. “I had at least the right to speak,” she says, modestly denying Van Es’s reports that people on Twitter were saying DeJong had done more than those in parliament to help. The book sold out in the Netherlands the next day.Against that background, Van Es recounts stories of extraordinary heroism and desperation: the farmer who cut off part of his finger in order to get paid leave so he could build a secret shelter for children or the couple who turned their food-testing laboratory into a safe house, saving 50 children, with the help of a local doctor, but whose own lives ended in depression and poverty or the family who sheltered in a hideout beneath a tree in a pine forest, breathing by means of a hand-pump connected to the ground above them.But The Cut Out Girl doesn’t end with De Jong’s return to the Van Es household after the war. There can be no uncomplicated happy ending. After a period of stability, in which she married and had three children, De Jong felt like “a cut-out picture of a perfect wife from a magazine”. She became increasingly depressed and isolated from her husband, whose traditional Judaism was “not very meaningful” to her. “I couldn’t live with it,” she says. In 1972, she attempted to kill herself.“I don’t think I had survivor’s guilt,” she reflects. “It was more the idea that I did not – I ought not – to be there. There was nobody who wanted me. When you have no family of your own, and you live with people who can send you away, no connection is unbreakable.”Life healed her, she says: “And the children and my choices. It took time.” At 47, she got orced. “I married a very good man. But he couldn’t come along after a long time. I didn’t know what I wanted.”And then there was another terrible fracture, when Jans van Es – the woman she once called “Ma” – cut her off, the family mystery that is the emotional heart of the book: “Why, at my grandmother’s funeral, was Lien unmentioned and unseen?” Van Es asks. “How could such a connection break?”To answer this would be to give too much away. But the book has been healing for Van Es’s family. His mother, who was terrified about what its revelations might do to her parents’ reputation as brave members of the resistance, has been comforted by its reception. As Van Es says, winning the Costa has been an “incredible confirmation of what was quite a scary enterprise. Quite a lot of people have said they think it’s a kind book. So it was really uniting.”It has also been uniting for his immediate family, in particular for him and his teenage stepdaughter, Josie. De Jong’s experiences of feeling unwanted taught him “how important it is to tell people all the time: ‘You matter to me.’ It gave me a really good chance to talk to Josie. It has been a very meaningful thing for our family.”“Nobody is perfect,” De Jong adds. “We can see in the book that you can be a human being with all your faults and all your good things.” Van Es is already at work on another book, if not closer to home, then closer to his academic interests, on Shakespeare and the novel. And De Jong? “Just going on.”There are so many books already out there about the war, Van Es worries at one point. “There are also so many songs about love,’” De Jong replies.The Cut Out Girl: A Story of War and Family, Lost and Found by Bart van Es (Penguin Books, £9.99).

While the number of properties coming onto the market also slowed, this doesn’t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months. With a touch of understatement, Gardner adds that the economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain”. Bu he’s hopeful that prices might pick up this year if economic conditions hold up.If the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with the unemployment rate and borrowing costs remaining close to current levels, we would expect UK house prices to rise at a low single-digit pace in 2019.”Reaction to follow....European stock markets may make gains, following a strong rally on Wall Street last night after the Federal Reserve said it would be patient about raising interest rates again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb1d6e4b540b218967c2e96c08e83f16980083ff/43_237_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fda37444810fe5e89bae0e0142780448","title":"corbyn avert hard brexit tory may deal labour","story":"In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday, experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit. Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator. These gifts are not part of their skill sets. Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign. Corbyn’s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert look like a libertine. May’s default mode towards Corbyn, on show again at question time this week, is to give him her full Lady Disdain.What is more, even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together, their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway. May’s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union, ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn’s. He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs, and supports his own version of free movement. The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen, preferably under a Conservative government.Tuesday’s Commons votes, where Tory MPs rallied around a policy very close to the one they demolished two weeks ago, seem to separate the two leaders still further. Having claimed hers was the only possible deal, May has now pledged to try to change the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement in order to keep her right wing on board. Corbyn, meanwhile, wants her to adopt a soft Brexit approach that would, if she embraced it, trigger a full-scale revolt from her own side and from the Democratic Unionists.For all those reasons and more, the May-Corbyn negotiations seem a sideshow. May has less need of them now. She has regained a bit of control. Her hardliners kept their swords sheathed. The chief whip and the chairman of the Tory backbenchers both played skilful hands, while pro-remain MPs overplayed theirs this time. A second referendum now looks a more distant prospect. All this has won May a reprieve. Given the stunning 230-vote defeat she suffered on 15 January, that is quite a turnaround.But it will not last long. It is not the end of the Brexit battle, and it may not even be the beginning of its end either. May’s characterisation of her majority as “substantial and sustainable” is pure wishful thinking. That is because, as others have argued since Tuesday evening, the vote for the Brady amendment was a vote for something that is both vague and unlikely to happen. The European Union has little incentive to agree to it. And, assuming that it will not happen, certainly not in the small window of time now available, it seems odds-on that May will soon be struggling to find a majority once more.May’s position is neither substantial nor sustainable. It is disjointed and delicate. It bears repeating, after Tuesday’s volte-face, that it was May herself, not the EU, who created the all-UK backstop that she is now seeking to unpick. But the deeper truth, which she must have known when she originally agreed to it in 2017, is that the backstop was an attempt to reconcile three promises that are almost impossible to fit together in one consistent policy.The first of these is May’s promise to leave the customs union, which she made because she knows that the Thatcherite right of her party, including some of the most fanatical long-term advocates of Brexit, attaches immense importance – though it was barely mentioned in 2016 – to an autonomous trade policy. The second is her promise to Ireland, which in law and by treaty she is duty bound to make, that a new trade regime would not cause the creation of a hard border of any kind. And the third is the promise she made to the DUP after the 2017 election that she would not permit customs and regulatory ergence between Britain and Northern Ireland.These three promises are mutually contradictory. That was the case before Tuesday and it is still true now. You can’t have an autonomous trade policy and an open border. That is why the backstop exists at all. It is there to ensure that the open border in Ireland remains in force in the face of May’s commitment, driven by her right wing, to a sovereign trade policy. These unavoidable truths are not going to go away just because May and Graham Brady managed to find a form of words about “alternative arrangements” that pulled the Tory party back from an outright split after the 15 January vote against the deal.This brings us back to the role that Corbyn may yet play. For most of the parliamentary Brexit process, Corbyn has been a large but inert presence. Brexit politics has happened around him, not with or through him. He remains content, it seems, to go through the motions but not to get his hands dirty. Up to a point, it has been a coherent strategy if your three priorities, like Corbyn’s, are for Brexit to happen, for the Tories to own it, and for your own pristine politics to remain unsullied by the most important argument facing the country.In the end, though, events may be propelling Corbyn to mix with the sweatier end of politics. One pressure is that backbenchers in his party – such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn – have emerged as de facto Labour figureheads. Another is that May has begun to engage with workplace and environmental regulatory issues that Labour cares about. Crucially, May’s defeat two weeks ago and her current turn to the Tory right are highlighting the harsh reality of the Brexiter trade autonomy dream that she has now empowered. A more adept Labour leader would have been reaching out relentlessly to Tory moderates over recent months on the customs elements of the eventual UK-EU trade deal, searching for common ground and looking for ways to ensnare them in a shared commitment to the open borders and regulatory alignment that the hard Brexiters so loathe.Such a thing may yet happen anyway. If May fails to get the changes from the EU that she seeks, and if this week’s Tory party unity comes under strain, as it may, then a space could open up for a softer Brexit deal. Such a deal has always been the least worst viable outcome to Brexit. This week’s events have underscored more than ever why May’s deal and no deal need not be the only options. Even Corbyn must see what is now at stake, and why engaging seriously with May is overwhelmingly in the country’s interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4db79c095d59f8281cdd4a23bbfe778ff7fc8ad/0_200_5150_3091/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14fccb7c11bd7a878d1450e743e73ab9","title":"education clarks shoes tory shop child development","story":"The government’s proposal that shop workers should help kickstart children’s early development is laughableParents, we’ve all been there: a high-street shoe shop in early September. Everyone with a school-aged child has simultaneously realised that if they don’t get around to buying shoes today, the kids are going to have to start the year wearing flip-flops, or wellies. The queue is out of the door, heaps of small black lace-ups litter the aisles. Babies are wailing. Somebody’s toddler has got a foot stuck in the measuring machine. It’s too hot in the store, and there’s a heady scent of sweat and wee. Your own children are desperate to leave because you rashly bribed them to come here with the promise of a trip to the Lego shop and a doughnut.How, you may wonder, could this annual ritual get any more hellish? As ever, the government is one step ahead: it has come up with the brilliant wheeze of training staff in Clarks shoe shops to “engage children in conversation” with the aim of “improving language skills”. We are assured that this initiative will be up and running by the summer, in time for the pre-school rush. The children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi has explained that “by working with a growing number of businesses, charities and experts, we’re making it easier for parents to kickstart early development”.Really, where do they come up with this stuff? One can only imagine that Zahawi has never been into Clarks during the pre-school rush. If he had, he would know that there is no less suitable educational environment, and the only thing this initiative will help parents to develop is a stress-related migraine. Anyone aware of the cost of Clarks shoes – a typical full-price pair will set you back at least £30 – would also be aware that the chain is not, perhaps, quite the environment in which to engage parents or children from disadvantaged backgrounds.Let’s give our esteemed leaders the benefit of the doubt, however, and assume that somewhere deep within this misguided plan there is a good intention. The government is, quite rightly, concerned about the rates of literacy in the UK, citing the figure that 7.1 million adults have very poor literacy skills, and that rates of early literacy are particularly low among disadvantaged families. There is also plenty of evidence to support the argument that this is not just an issue for schools child from a family in which parents are confident and communicative has a better chance of developing good speech and language skills.But the idea that a shop assistant can provide any kind of meaningful support to parents during a harried interaction in which they are also trying to buy shoes is just laughable. What parents – especially disadvantaged parents – need is proper investment in early-years education. A 2010 evaluation of the Sure Start initiative found that children’s centres, which offered consistent, high-quality expert support, could have a positive influence on the home-learning environment and on parenting more generally. Buts many as 1,000 children’s centres have closed down since 2010, and many of those that are left offer only a fraction of the services they once did. These centres, which were much-loved and so critical to any prospect of social mobility, have been the first thing to go for many cash-strapped local authorities. As have libraries, another crucial source of free support with literacy and communication – almost 130 of them have closed in the last year alone.It’s easy to see the appeal of this scheme, which creates the illusion of commitment to social mobility while costing the government nothing. The cherry on the cake is that the private sector stands to benefit in the form of excellent PR for Clarks and the other businesses involved. But as we parents stand in those stuffy, slow-moving queues next September, listening to sales staff deliver their educational message while we attempt to pacify our restless children with Haribo, perhaps we will be forgiven a hollow laugh.• Alice O’Keeffe is a literary critic and journalist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5638a7d49bbd951e9b7e1b3fcea3ea5272ae643f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ad64b956064afdae2b5249c3153f081","title":"ireland hard border brexit backstop good friday agreement","story":"The Good Friday agreement allows people to identify as Irish, British or both. We’re being forced, once again, to choose sidesOne of my earliest childhood memories is of a circling red light motioning cars to stop near the border, silencing all who encountered its fiery glare. That red light filled my young heart with fear. I didn’t know if the gloved hand holding the torch was that of the RUC, the British army, the IRA or the UVF.I grew up during the Troubles in the shadow of Cloghogue, one of the largest British army bases in Northern Ireland. Having to make detours to avoid customs and security checks along “bomb alley” – an atrocity-laden eight-mile stretch of road between Newry and Dundalk – was as frightening as it was familiar.It still is: to this day there are some back roads in South Armagh that I will not drive on alone after dark. It’s hard to explain to those who have not lived through a conflict that claimed more than 3,500 lives, in a region with a smaller population than most large UK cities, how the border permeated every aspect of our lives.It’s also hard to explain why the Brexit backstop – an insurance policy proposed between the EU and the UK to avoid a hard border, and extended to the whole of the UK at the latter’s insistence – is so critical. As the business editor of the largest media group in Ireland, I can give you chapter and verse about the economic threats a hard or no-deal Brexit poses for the Irish, Northern Irish and British economies. But you know about those already.The reality is that no amount of economic modelling can capture the unquantifiable human and psychological costs of the return of a hard border. Many argue that technological solutions – drones and suchlike – will do the trick. This is farcical: you only eliminate physical checks between two territories separated by a border when they share a customs union and have broad regulatory alignment. Everything else is infrastructure.As a journalist, I have been staggered by the scale and speed at which dangerous stereotypes and vituperative tropes – in some cases barely concealed racism – surrounding Ireland’s supposed intransigence have resurfaced in the UK’s political and media discourse. This process has been accompanied by astonishment in some quarters that Ireland, arguably England’s oldest colony, is a saboteur, reprobate or badly behaved underling for refusing to fall into line with the UK’s demands, if we knew what they were. When the BBC’s John Humphrys, one of the most prominent public broadcasters in Britain, asked Ireland’s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, why “Dublin” didn’t just leave the EU and “throw in their lot with this country”, Ireland uttered a collective gasp of incredulity verging on despair. What’s more alarming is that Anglo-Irish political relations, having warmed to a zenith of sorts in recent years, have plunged into a rapid freeze in a matter of months.Those who want to tear up the backstop, or feel gleeful at the prospect of no deal, should recall that the first shots of the Troubles were fired at customs posts such as Newry, requiring the RUC, and later the British army, to protect officials, civilians and military alike. These incidents paved the way for the installation of those mammoth watchtowers, helicopter bases and checkpoints – the hard border – that blighted our landscape. Just as the first shots were fired over customs posts, it was our membership of the customs union and the single market – the free movement of goods and people – that allowed us to tear down the physical borders and begin the task of demolishing the walls in our hearts and minds.Is a return to violence – the recent car bomb in Derry felt like a terrifying foreshock – inevitable? Not necessarily. But the return of a border, even one that starts out as soft and virtual, will – like the customs posts of old – invite a regulatory and security mission creep that will disrupt lives and livelihoods and prove tempting for some who are intent on taking us back to darker times.It’s a gamble we can’t afford to take. The Brexit backstop – this fundamental need to avoid a border, rightly articulatedin stark, if belated and obvious terms at Davos by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar – is about so much more than tariffs and trade. It is about our identity. Brexit tears at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, which allows people like me, a Catholic who grew up in Newry, or a loyalist from east Belfast, to identify as British, Irish or both – and to celebrate our different allegiances.I can say, as an Irish woman from Northern Ireland, that I am Irish-British: in another time, I would have been tarred and feathered for saying so. Brexit strips away at those coveted birthrights. A border will force us, once again, to choose sides. As we stare down the barrel of Brexit, Theresa May has opened another front, securing parliamentary support to reopen the withdrawal agreement and demand significant and legally binding changes to the backstop that she vigorously defended for months.The prime minister may have scored a short-term pyrrhic victory in the internecine wars that have ided her party and the UK parliament. But backtracking on the backstop is a mistake, and a dangerous one at that. Placing party politics and political survival above the peace process is a risk we cannot afford to take."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76af56c9f3c04d5fe3a420c0da6fbf1956b30d90/0_17_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c2554f1a66c04121a20898188eb0624","title":"left green new deal ocasio cortez","story":"Progressives were caught napping by the financial crisis. They cannot not be as ill-prepared next timeIt’s often said that real change takes place at a time of crisis, but that’s not the whole story. A crisis makes change possible, but only when new ideas are knocking about does it actually happen. Otherwise, it is soon business as usual. The US economist Milton Friedman understood that fact, which is why he toiled away in the political wilderness to plot the downfall of postwar social democracy and was fully prepared when trouble arrived in the mid-1970s.Contrast that with the mainstream left, which was so in thrall to market forces and globalised capital that it was bereft of ideas when the financial crisis broke in 2007, and as a result blew a golden opportunity to challenge the status quo. The age of austerity was the result.Lessons needed to be learned – and they have been, not least by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who won a seat in the US House of Representatives and has been calling for a 21st-century equivalent of Franklin Roosevelt’s plan to tackle the Great Depression: a green new deal.Full disclosure here: I was a founder member of the UK Green New Deal Group in 2007 and have been banging on about the idea – with almost zero impact – ever since. There was a time in 2008 when both Barack Obama and Gordon Brown seemed to be warming to it, but the moment was lost.There is already pushback against Ocasio-Cortez, and without question the immediate chances of success are not great. For a green new deal to become a reality, the Democrats would have to be in control of the White House and both houses of Congress. What’s more, the Democratic hierarchy would need to stop thinking that the answer to Donald Trump is to cleave to the centre.But, as the new right showed all those decades ago, it is important to start preparing the ground even when the politics look unfavourable, so that you are ready when the opportunity arises. And, let’s face it, it is only a matter of time before an opportunity does present itself. Why? Because the world faces not just one but four challenges in the coming years, and this quadruple crunch will demand new thinking.Crunch number one is the ever-increasing threat posed by global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world has until 2030 to take the measures needed to prevent a temperature increase of more than 1.5C. If it doesn’t, catastrophe awaits. The decarbonisation of economies is happening, helped by a sharp drop in the cost of renewable energy sources, but progress is not nearly fast enough. Green New Dealers are rather like those calling in the 1930s for countries to mobilise in the fight against fascism: they think rearmament is happening too slowly, and that the fight will only be won when economies are put on an environmental war footing.But that means speeding up the transition to renewables and conserving as much energy as possible during the transition from fossil fuels: scaling up investment in solar and wind power reducing needless heat loss from homes through mass energy efficiency programmes subsidising house-builders to install solar panels and introducing feed-in tariffs so that households can sell their excess energy to the National Grid.The third crunch is the risk that the world will suffer another financial and economic crisis before it has recovered from the last one, and at a time when the potency of the traditional weapon for dealing with recessions – that is, lower interests rates – is much reduced. Under a green new deal, central banks would do what they did in 2008 to 2009 – print money – only this time they would use it to invest in renewables and job-creating energy efficiency schemes, rather than handing the cash to the banks.That’s not just because it makes more sense to use quantitative easing to tackle the existential risk of climate change than to boost asset prices. It’s also because green quantitative easing would allow the creation of well-paid, skilled jobs in places that need them most: the rust belt of the US and the old industrial towns of the UK. Failure to do this last time has turned a triple crunch into a quadruple crunch by generating a ferocious political backlash.So far, that political anger has been exploited by the right. Ocasio-Cortez and her movement of young supporters think there is another way. And they have one big thing going for them: an idea whose time has come.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d4e2f61c215a594d2efdf991b0634357d87892/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df286395e9377c97afe80e2f1b3ca202 645w","title":"my canadian food odyssey by chef john quilter","story":"On his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaFor many years, Canada has rented a room in my thoughts, ever since I worked there as a young chef. I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country.When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed.The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”.The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours.Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto.One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597305e020ab2ad32cb503da49f25aff335f0cf4/0_432_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a048cd5a81fdd7e6e30a6f0caf192af1","title":"the lowdown on nova scotia canadas seaside paradise","story":"Sandy beaches, snug harbours and (possibly) the best lobster roll in the world.

Then, in October, 150 musicians, comedians and speakers come together for the Halifax Pop Explosion, showcasing emerging music and art. A popular draw in the summer, the Halifax Jazz Festival, the oldest in Atlantic Canada, attracts some of the best musicians in the world to a city-wide extravaganza.One of Nova Scotia’s most famous artists is Maud Lewis (played by Sally Hawkins in the award-winning 2016 film Maudie), many of whose naïve, child-like paintings depict rural Nova Scotia. Her work is on display at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. The province is also home to a rich and erse cultural heritage, including Mi’kmaq and First Nations, African Nova Scotian, Acadian and Celtic and Gaelic peoples, all of whom have shaped Nova Scotia’s story.There are many museums dotted around the province that bring to life the story of all these peoples. You can find out about African Nova Scotians at the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre in Birchtown on the South Shore – it takes visitors through the journey of early black settlers in Nova Scotia. And discover the history of the Acadian people – descendants from the French settlers – at the Grand-Pré national historic site and at Le Village Historique Acadien de la Nouvelle-Écosse. While, the Highland Village Museum is a living history museum and cultural centre that celebrates the Gaelic experience in Nova Scotia.The Bay of Fundy boasts the highest tides in the world – around 16 metres – and thanks to the Tidal Bore Rafting Resort you can – literally – ride that wave. The Shubenacadie River (don’t worry, the locals just call it “Shubie”) is known for its beauty and for regular sightings of bald eagles. Unforgettably, you can enjoy a seafood and wine tasting on a sandbar before 160bn tonnes of water fill up the estuary.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site is a special place to experience the outdoors with great camping, canoeing and hiking opportunities. Also, learn about the Mi’kmaq, a founding people of Nova Scotia and, to this day, the biggest indigenous group in the province.

Save a few days to drive around and enjoy the cultural heritage sites and scenic coastal viewpoints. Leave time, though, to hike one of the many trails such as Skyline or Franey in the national park for glimpses of moose, bald eagles and other wildlife.While summer and autumn are the most popular times to visit, there’s plenty to enjoy all year round. The White Point Beach Resort is one of Nova Scotia’s four-season jewels. Enjoy the miles of pure white sand beach in the summer and cozy up to an inviting fireplace next to windows overlooking the ocean during the winter. June to September is whale-watching season head to Brier Island or Cape Breton for the best views.Many trails are open year-round, such as Rogart Mountain Trail in Earltown, ideal for winter snowshoeing and summer hiking.

They cut out paper starfish – more formally known as sea stars – and put them up for “adoption” for a $1 donation. They assigned them names and personality traits, such as Cherry Bomb, who “loves hanging out on her phone”, “rocks the legging style” and “is really smart but isn’t a nerd”. They sold T-shirts that read: “Save the Starfish.”“We don’t have an ocean anywhere close by,” their now retired teacher Vickie Bailey said. “The students knew that they would never go to the coast, they would probably never get to see this type of starfish, but they were so passionate about what was happening.”When Drew Harvell, a marine ecology professor and researcher at Cornell University, received the $400 or so that Carl Stuart middle school in Conway collected, she knew the money should go to something important.“I almost cried, I was so touched. So I matched it with $400 of my own and then one of our donors here put in a bigger amount of money and that’s basically the funding that allowed us to do the initial survey,” Harvell said.Flash forward to today: Harvell and her co-authors are releasing their study inspired by the seed money from the kids. Cornell and the University of California, Davis, are publishing their work in the journal Science Advances.The campaign didn’t exactly save the starfish. The findings are dire. But researchers now know much more about the scope of the die-off after analyzing data from trained recreational and professional ers and deep offshore trawls.Sea star wasting disease has affected more than 20 species from Mexico to Alaska. Some species resisted the disease better and others have evolved to survive.At the time of the outbreak, videos showed beaches littered with the arms of dead starfish, internal organs spilling out through lesions, Harvell recalled.The effect has been particularly bad for the sunflower star, a 3-4ft-wide creature that can have as many as two dozen arms. The sunflower star “crawls over the seafloor like a robotic vacuum cleaner, munching on everything in its path”, as described by Cornell’s media team.Sunflower sea stars, which live only on the west coast of North America, are now virtually gone from the waters off California, Oregon and Washington.Previous research has suggested that with warmer temperatures linked to climate change, the wasting disease has a higher risk of infection and kills sea stars faster. The new study finds that outbreaks of the virus among sunflower sea stars coincided with anomalously warm waters.And the disappearance of the species is having cascading effects on the ecosystem.Sunflower sea stars once kept the sea urchin population under control, but now urchin numbers are exploding, leading to barrens where they have devoured kelp habitats down to the pink sea floor beneath them.While the species is imperiled in the lower 48, they’re doing a little better in British Columbia and in some places in Alaska, Harvell said. Researchers will need to understand whether the sunflower sea star can be repatriated if the disease ever leaves west coast waters.“It’s really vital that something be done,” Harvell said. “It’s not an issue that we’ve dealt with before so I don’t have an immediate suggestion of what we would do. I think that we definitely need to convene a group of scientists and really talk about the issue and what are the highest priority items.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

Cook this roux on a gentle heat for a couple of minutes until it acquires a sandy texture. Add a small ladleful of the cooled milk to the roux and work it together, on the heat, to form a stiff paste. Strain the remainder of the milk into the paste and bring to the boil, whisking constantly. Simmer this white sauce on a very low heat, whisking occasionally, for 10 minutes. Pour in the cream and egg yolk mixture, simmer for a minute before adding all the gruyere and half the parmesan and then removing from the heat. Whisk the sauce to ensure the cheese melts before pouring into a large bowl and laying clingfilm across the surface.Melt the remaining butter and brush the interiors of the souffle moulds very thoroughly with the butter. Sprinkle the remaining parmesan in the moulds and rotate them in order to ensure an even coating. Place the moulds in the fridge.Preheat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5.Add a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt to the egg whites. Whisk the egg whites – preferably with an electric mixer – until they form stiff shiny peaks. Remove the film from the cheese mixture and whisk in a small amount of egg white, whisking vigorously to make a smooth mixture. Now add the remaining white and very gently cut and fold the mixtures together, making the mixture as homogenous as possible without losing volume. Spoon the mixture into the chilled souffle moulds. Smooth the surface with a palette knife before running a little knife around the top of the inside perimeter of the moulds to prevent the mixture sticking to the sides as it rises. The souffles can be chilled for up to an hour in the fridge at this juncture.Pour some boiling water into an oven tray. Place the souffles, spaced apart, in the tray and then bake the souffles for 11-13 minutes, by which time they should be well risen and firm to the touch.

In a sauté pan, heat the butter, then put in the guanciale or pancetta and fry until golden and crispy. Take off the heat, and lift out the guanciale or pancetta to a warm plate, so that it stays crunchy.Put the peppercorns into the pan and crush with a meat hammer or the end of a rolling pin, then add a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta and stir it around to take up all the bits of guanciale or pancetta which may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.Beat the egg yolks and a whole egg in a warm bowl with the grated pecorino romano.One minute before the spaghetti is ready, start to mix in a ladleful of the cooking water at a time until the eggs and cheese become creamy.Drain the pasta (but reserve the cooking water) and toss it in the pan of pepper, together with the reserved guanciale or pancetta.Add a little more cooking water if the pasta seems too dry, then transfer it to the bowl of eggs and cheese and toss well, until coated in the silky mixture.

Add the leek and sauté to soften – it will take 3-4 minutes – then start adding the spinach, a large handful at a time. Stir between each addition to wilt it. It may seem as if it will never fit in the pan, but as it wilts there will be hardly any volume left. Finally add the chopped herbs and mix them in to wilt, too. The whole process will take about 6-8 minutes, depending on the leaves you are using just make sure they are soft by the end of it.Remove the frying pan from the stove and season with the garlic and some salt and pepper. You can set this aside until you are ready to eat and the table is set it will also keep in the fridge until later.You only want to cook the eggs once everyone is at the table, as it is best to eat this while the yolks are still runny.Heat the spinach mixture again and use a spoon to create 4 little wells in the cooked leaves, one in each quarter. Crack an egg into each well, season the eggs with a touch of salt and pepper and cover the pan. Cook on a low heat until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny – about 3-4 minutes. Serve straight away. You can drizzle with some yogurt and sumac or serve it as is.

When ready to make your tart, line your tin with the pastry, keeping any offcuts in case you need to plug any holes after blind baking.Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 150Cgas mark 2.Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes, until golden and sandy textured. Leave to cool while you prepare the custard.In a large bowl, whisk the yolks and sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Put the cream into a pan, slit the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape the seeds into the cream. (Place the empty pod in a jar of caster sugar to make vanilla sugar.)Heat the cream until it just starts to come to the boil, then pour it in a thin stream into the yolks, whisking as you do. Return the whole mixture to the pan and heat very gently, stirring continuously, until it thickens slightly.Strain the custard into a jug. If there are any lumps in the custard (caused by cooking it at too high a temperature), give it a whizz with a handheld blender until it is completely smooth.Pour the custard into the baked tart shell and return to the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the filling feels firm but still a little wobbly to the touch.

The days when Luiz Felipe Scolari was shown the door in February of his first season, André Villas-Boas was cut adrift in March or Roberto di Matteo, fresh from a European Cup triumph, dumped unceremoniously in late November are apparently long gone. Yet this is the kind of wretched occasion prone to leave a livid hierarchy flicking through a list of potential interims as they contemplate a return to chopping and changing. Head coaches, after all, have been condemned by defeats far less emphatic.Maurizio Sarri had spent most of the second half here scribbling frantically in a notepad while his team were shredded, brutally and brilliantly, out on the pitch by Bournemouth. The hosts had only recently emerged from a run of 11 defeats in 14 games in all competitions but poured through Chelsea’s panicked and pathetic ranks, their counterattacks carrying all the bite and incision their opponents have lacked since the late autumn, sensing little to no resistance en route. The notes could express nothing else but horror.Not since 1996 have the London club endured a league thrashing of this magnitude. In other words, Roman Abramovich has never had to digest a loss so unpalatable. All of which makes this situation feel far more volatile than it might otherwise have been. This is actually uncharted territory, for all Sarri’s post-match insistence that he felt more “frustrated” than under pressure. The Italian had cast his coaching staff from the away dressing room and, while they shivered outside, spent an hour with his players attempting to piece together what had gone so hideously wrong.Only César Azpilicueta and David Luiz dared to approach a disgruntled away support to offer their apologies after the final whistle though, by then, plenty had ventured out into the night and away. Those who watch this team consistently are finding everything, from tactics to substitutions to meek and feeble displays, grimly predictable at present. They had whipped up a chorus of “You don’t know what you’re doing” to greet Gonzalo Higuaín’s withdrawal when their team’s deficit was two. Sarri needs Higuaín, a player he convinced the board to buy, to make an immediate impact. The Argentinian’s Premier League debut amounted to being flagged twice for offside, and not a single shot fired off or chance created.Not that this defeat was down to the 31-year-old loanee from Juventus. Higuaín was just the latest Chelsea forward struggling to provide some bite for a team who ping passes with little intent, whose movement off the ball can become aimless, before desperation sets in. They had needed to shift the ball far more quickly during a first half when they were actually on top, but they never went closer than Mateo Kovacic’s early header that was tipped on to the crossbar by Artur Boruc. Bournemouth’s threat, as sporadic as it was at first, always carried more menace, not least because this Chelsea team are only ever one concession from a collapse. Retreat almost exactly a year and the Cherries had won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. This time, they would run riot on home territory.The home side’s ruthlessness was utterly admirable, the slick nature of their passing and movement putting the Carabao Cup finalists to shame. There was Ryan Fraser’s clever flick for David Brooks, and the Welshman’s precisely weighted pull-back into space for Josh King to dispatch and force Bournemouth ahead. Then the combination play between King and Brooks around the hour mark, with Brooks cutting inside a befuddled David Luiz to slide in a second beyond the exposed Kepa Arrizabalaga.King, with a splendid finish from Junior Stanislas’ pass, and the substitute Charlie Daniels would complete the rout. The home side did not even need their top scorer Callum Wilson, who has undergone a minor knee operation to flush out the joint, to run amok. They were as brilliant as Chelsea were dreadful. The visitors’ goal difference had taken such a pounding by the end that they had even slipped behind Arsenal in the table. The six-point advantage they held only a few weeks ago is a distant memory, and the scrutiny is all on a head coach struggling, still, to comprehend why."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e86a884ef1ac86fb2ee5a7511924e988fb3321/303_733_3917_2350/master/3917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5bb6fea070a77a3e5be5ccf9532853e","title":"jurgen klopp frustrated referee leicester draw","story":"• Klopp highlights penalty appeal and Harry Maguire foul• ‘I think everybody agrees there could have been a penalty’Jürgen Klopp claimed Liverpool were refused a clear penalty and Harry Maguire should not have been on the pitch to deny his Premier League leaders a seven-point advantage in the title race as Leicester secured a 1-1 draw at Anfield.Liverpool extended their lead over Manchester City to five points but missed the opportunity to capitalise fully on the champions’ defeat at Newcastle United as they failed to beat a team outside the top six for the first time this season.Sadio Mané gave the hosts an early lead only for Maguire to equalise in first half stoppage time. The England defender had earlier been booked for tripping Mané as he turned towards goal, an offence that Klopp believed should have been red for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. Martin Atkinson’s refusal to penalise Ricardo Pereira for clipping Naby Keïta inside the penalty area in the second half added to the Liverpool manager’s frustration although, given the chances Leicester squandered, he accepted the draw.“I think everybody agrees there could have been a penalty,” said Klopp. “It maybe should have been a penalty. I don’t know why it wasn’t a penalty. Have I spoken to the referee about it? No. I don’t think it will change anything. I don’t know what he thought at that moment. I think he had the best position.

Time was running out, and the home side appeared to be heading for another defeat on the backs of those which had seen them depart two cup competitions in quick succession, when the goals they required for a turnaround arrived. The first was scored by Son Heung-min on his first appearance for Spurs since arriving back from the Asian Cup and then came the winner from someone who has been at the club all the while and finally may feel he belongs.The mix of relief and joy on Fernando Llorente’s face as he celebrated his goal with three minutes of this contest remaining was as eye-catching as it was understandable. The Spaniard has found it hard going ever since he joined Tottenham from Swansea two summers ago and especially in recent weeks as he has been asked to fill in for the injured Harry Kane. Quite simply, he is not in the England captain’s class, and that has been noticeable, painfully so at times, as was the case here on 52 minutes when he missed an absolute sitter. Cue howls of fury from the majority of the 29,164 people in attendance – Tottenham’s lowest ever crowd for a Premier League fixture at Wembley – yet they were in raptures when the player finally came good.Danny Rose swung a cross from the left deep into Watford’s area and the ball hung in the air long enough for Llorente to rise above José Holebas and send a perfectly placed header into the far corner of the net for his first league goal in over 12 months. Perfect timing and, you could say in light of recent comments by Mauricio Pochettino, a perfect boost for Llorente’s ego.“Fernando works so hard for the team and today he helped the team win three points,” said the Tottenham manager. “It is a massive thing and will help build his confidence.”That will be the hope for all concerned at Spurs before Newcastle’s visit here on Saturday, when another victory for the Pochettino’s men would see them overtake Manchester City in second and find themselves just four points behind Liverpool. Not bad for a side whose sense of purpose had yet again come into question following Sunday’s FA Cup defeat at Crystal Palace.“There are still a lot of games to play,” said Pochettino when asked about the significance of this result. “But this is a fantastic way to finish a little bit of the negativity that has been around in the last few days.”The biggest encouragement Pochettino can take from this contest is the spirit his players showed. Tottenham were not at their best, during the first-half especially, when their forward play was stodgy and predictable. But the second period proved very different as they performed with greater purpose and aggression.Much of that came from Son, who put in a remarkable display given he only returned from the United Arab Emirates on Saturday. The South Korean performed with his usual energy and direct running and drove Spurs on as they searched for an equaliser following Craig Cathcart’s goal for Watford on 38 minutes, the defender sending a header into an empty net, via a deflection off Davinson Sánchez, after Hugo Lloris hesitated in his attempt to keep out Holebas’s corner.That was the case from others in white and blue, Llorente included, and, as such, it would have been a shame if his most memorable contribution of the game had been the moment he caught the rebound to his own shot with a knee and sent the ball over a practically open net.It was a howler yet it was Watford who were ultimately left feeling sick. As Javi Gracia said, his side “missed a very good chance to get points against a very good team” and while the visitors were second best in terms of possession and territory, they arguably deserved a draw given the togetherness they showed throughout. Instead they remain ninth having lost for the first time in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554e296a751ae065f2101f5a8ae79538cc4d313b/366_70_1656_994/master/1656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffcb80efd2db1cfef3f71146b02c3245","title":"maurizio sarri chelsea my fault motivate","story":"Maurizio Sarri has admitted he may not be equipped to motivate his players after seeing Chelsea suffer the heaviest league defeat of Roman Abramovich’s ownership at Bournemouth.Sarri, who endured chants of “You don’t know what you’re doing” from Chelsea fans, kept his team in the dressing room for around an hour after the final whistle in an effort to understand why a game that had been goalless at half-time had unravelled so spectacularly. The defeat led to Chelsea dropping out of the top four on goal difference and places Sarri’s position under scrutiny six months into a three-year contract.Asked if he was good enough, he added: “Maybe it’s my fault, maybe I’m not able to motivate them. But the team is very strong, it is also able to win without the coach.”Sarri had been critical of his players after the recent defeat by Arsenal in the hope to coax a positive reaction but, despite encouraging wins against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup semi-finals and Sheffield Wednesday in the fourth round of the FA Cup, this was a second successive league defeat.“I feel frustrated, not under pressure,” said Sarri, who asked his coaching staff to leave the dressing room post-match. “I didn’t see the signal of my work. So I am frustrated. I wanted to understand, so I spoke with the players immediately but it’s very difficult for them to say why. So I have to try again tomorrow, because I need to solve this problem.“I wanted to talk with them alone, without anybody else.

Many more people are thought to have taken part in the event without signing the official pledge.At the same time, Britain’s supermarkets are reporting a surge in sales of vegan food and drink, which they expect to continue throughout the year. They are tapping into not only the burgeoning vegan market but also the UK’s estimated 22 million “flexitarians”, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their meat consumption.The number of Veganuary pledges for 2019 exceeded those in the previous four years combined, suggesting that veganism is becoming a mainstream movement. The organisers of Veganuary say six in 10 who take the “Veganuary pledge” say they plan to stay vegan.Thirteen new overseas partnerships increased Veganuary’s presence elsewhere in the world – in India, Sweden, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, South Africa, Japan, Iceland and Russia.“With a quarter of a million participants this year, Veganuary is finishing on an all-time high,” said Rich Hardy, head of campaigns at Veganuary. “I think Veganuary has reached critical mass now – vegan living is growing it’s here to stay, it’s part of the national conversation and it has credibility. That’s great news for people, animals and the planet.”Support for the campaign has also led to a vegan boost among food producers, with supermarkets, manufacturers and high street restaurant and pub chains also bolstering their plant-based ranges to meet demand.The Papa John’s takeaway chain this week ran into trouble with vegans who claimed they were sent real cheese pizzas after dairy-free alternatives ran out.On supermarket wine aisles, sales of Co-op’s own-label vegan varieties have doubled since it rolled out front-of-pack labelling last year. A new organic and vegan white wine has also had a fivefold increase in sales.Sainsbury’s has recently started selling fake meat next to the real thing, after a successful trial last year when it launched a new range of plant-based burgers and mince.Rather than being displayed in a dedicated vegan section, meat and fish alternatives such as jackfruit burgers and mushroom “shroomdogs” are being stocked alongside their meat counterparts in 20 branches of Sainsbury’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4ca7223c683571f5a76daafc13a45f5e180015f/874_406_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9690da485ab2853927928aef69430863","title":"uk broadcasters face advertising tipping point new study finds","story":"Audience decline found among 16 to 34-year-olds is forecast to hit other key demographicsBroadcasters are facing a tipping point in the next five years where a faster decline in traditional viewing will make TV campaigns too expensive to be cost-effective for advertisers.A new report is forecasting an “inflection point” for UK TV where the decline in viewing already well-established among 16- to 34-year-olds will spread to other key demographics ultimately threatening TVs greatest selling point of mass-market reach for advertisers.“TV has been the go-to media channel for advertisers seeking mass-reach,” says Christian Polman, chief strategy officer at Ebiquity, the media audit firm behind the report. “We are saying that unless action is taken by advertisers and broadcasters that by 2022 TV will no longer hold the crown as having the highest return on investment on a media plan.

But in an age of predatory capitalism and rampant inequality, can one man’s modest suggestions really make much difference? By  Daniel CohenEvery Tuesday night, an email newsletter goes out to 13 million subscribers. It’s far more popular than Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop newsletter, which has 8 million, and the New York Times Morning Briefing, with 1.7 million. Its name, Money Saving Expert’s Money Tips, barely hints at the astounding range of tricks and deals contained within. Recent emails have featured “hacks” for cheaper meals at Nando’s and McDonald’s, deals on broadband and savings accounts, codes giving discounted access to airport lounges and an offer for free radiator heat-reflector pads.The newsletter looks like a relic from an earlier age of the internet: thousands of words, with no ads and few images. It began as an email that Martin Lewis – the personal finance journalist now better known as the Money Saving Expert – wrote for his friends. Today, it is the work of dozens of people at MoneySavingExpert, the website Lewis founded in 2003, which has become one of the 100 most popular sites in the UK, with 16 million visitors a month.The business of saving money has made Lewis extremely wealthy. After he sold the site in 2012 to the price-comparison firm MoneySupermarket for £87m, the Financial Times called him “the most successful journalist in the world, ever”. A year later, he was the seventh most Googled celebrity in the UK, nestled between Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.Lewis still worries over every line in the email each week. When I went to meet him on a Tuesday afternoon last July, he was studying the draft of that night’s newsletter, pondering aloud the merits of competing broadband deals. There was a gold piggy bank on his desk. It was the height of the heatwave, and Lewis, who is lean and often tanned, was dressed in the uniform of a sensible dad doing his best to enjoy a long-awaited summer holiday: a short-sleeved, stripy white shirt with a denim collar, denim shorts and the navy Skechers that he wore almost every time I met him.In our age of insecurity, Lewis stands out as a reassuring source of authority. Addressing a country that has never been comfortable talking about money, Lewis takes us by the hand and guides us through the bewildering world of finance. He comes across as a kind of double agent, who goes undercover among the powerful then reports back to the rest of society. It may feel as though banks, corporations and energy companies are lined up against the inidual, with few politicians willing to intervene, but Lewis’s work offers the alluring promise that in the battle between business and consumer, you can, with the right information, emerge the victor.Today, at 46, Lewis is a TV personality as much as anything. He appears weekly on Good Morning Britain and This Morning, while his primetime ITV programme, The Martin Lewis Money Show, regularly attracts around 4 million viewers.Lewis’s success depends on the trust he has built with the public, and he tends to this like an anxious parent. Everything featured on Money Saving Expert has been chosen by its editorial team, but once those recommendations have been decided on, the commercial team then tries to arrange deals with the companies offering the products. The site makes a commission when readers click on affiliated links for such products, which are marked with an asterisk. Still, when I joined Lewis for his meeting about the email, he was cautious. He worried that one description was too “selly”. “We don’t want people to think we’re advertising,” he said. A fidgety presence, he took great care with the recommendations, mindful of the impact they can have: Tesco Bank’s website once crashed when one of its savings accounts appeared in the email.With his fiery rhetoric, his efforts to defend the little guy against vested interests, Lewis may look like a populist. But, at heart, he has a technocratic temperament: he identifies specific problems, and tries to solve them with tweaks. On the rare occasions when he does speak out, it’s because he has decided the system has stopped working properly.Lewis is, in short, a centrist – perhaps the only truly popular centrist in Britain. Instead of seeking structural change, his formula combines educating the public with campaigning for small adjustments to the system. But at a time of growing inequality, with politicians unwilling or unable to hold corporations to account, is this enough? What is needed, the economist John Kay told me, “is not more information from the financial services industry, but actually an industry that is trustworthy and reliable”. The question remains whether Lewis’s approach is the best we can hope for, or a distraction from real change.There’s nothing new about wanting to save money. But now, a decade after the financial crisis, it feels particularly urgent. It’s clear that things will never go back to normal: the days of a secure job for life, with a steadily rising salary and a generous pension pot, are over. You won’t be able to support yourself through old age on your pension alone you might never make enough to afford your own home.You need to be prudent, but how? Since the deregulation and privatisations of the 1980s, we have had to make more and more financial decisions, and they have become dizzyingly complex. There are so many options: Britain has more than 300 banks, dozens of energy companies. Then there are all the credit cards, broadband providers, mobile networks. You know that if make the wrong choice you will get ripped off. It’s easy to panic or to bury your head in the sand.What has made Lewis so popular is that he offers a concrete response to this uncertainty. His work holds out the hope that you can take control of your finances and your life. This isn’t a question of stopping spending. “I don’t think being tight is a particularly sensible thing with money,” he told me. He wants to help people get more from the money they have, and reduce the stress that money can cause. The trick is to “play the system, understand how it works, get the best products” – to turn modern finance’s ersity to your own advantage, rather than being overwhelmed and exploited by it.In this respect, Lewis is less like a doctor, doling out pills for the patient to swallow, than a personal trainer: he promises to make you stronger through your own hard work. And no matter how little you understand at first, you can still judge his advice for yourself by its effect on your bank balance. This is what has saved Lewis from the fate of so many experts, who incur resentment by appearing to lord their expertise over everyone else. Instead of just telling you what to do, Lewis makes you feel as if you, too, can become a money-saving expert.When Lewis was in charge of Money Saving Expert, he worked up to 90 hours a week. Since selling the company, he has continued to play an important role, as executive chairman, and pictures of him wearing a confident expression appear all over the website like a talisman against profligacy. But even though he has cut down, to 50 or 60 hours, his schedule still appears exhausting in its variety and intensity. Rather than prioritising a particular audience, he addresses whoever he can, modulating his message each time like a shrewd ambassador for financial prudence. What matters to him is getting the word out. On a Monday morning last summer, I accompanied Lewis to ITV’s studios in west London for his appearance on This Morning. As he waited to go on set, he asked a member of the crew if she watched Love Island. She didn’t. “I’m thinking of doing Love Island this year,” he said. When his turn on This Morning came, he took questions about student finance from callers, staring intensely at the camera as he listened. As usual, he spoke in rapidfire bursts, slowing down theatrically for emphasis.After that, he got a motorbike taxi to Broadcasting House, the BBC headquarters, for his weekly Radio 5 Live phone-in. The segment was introduced with the song Bills, by the American singer LunchMoney Lewis, and as it played Lewis air drummed, bobbing his head. It was a longer slot than This Morning, with a more leisurely pace the callers seemed canny, and Lewis responded with a level of detail he tends to avoid on TV. That afternoon, he attended a meeting at the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, a charity that he founded in 2016, to carry out research and campaigns on the connection between mental illness and financial problems.The next day, Lewis met with Matt Hancock, who was then the culture secretary. It was a few weeks after Lewis had announced that he was suing Facebook for defamation, over fake adverts that featured his name and image, and the pair discussed online ads and scams. That evening, Lewis started tweeting about Love Island. “I’ve never watched before – I’m trying it this time – and yes I am intrigued,” he told his 566,000 followers. On Good Morning Britain that week, he referred to a Love Island contestant’s “semi-permanent Russian lashes”. When a presenter asked what made the lashes Russian, Lewis responded, “maybe they need to get them on quickly”. (He was once a finalist in a competition for young Jewish stand-up comedians.) He made a “ba-dum-tish” sound, with a drumming gesture, and walked off the set. Two days later, he wrote a comment piece for the Financial Times, proposing reforms to student finance.Lewis, who has a knack for remembering numbers, is happy to play the role of a financial savant in his TV appearances. “Is there something you don’t know? Anything you don’t know?” Angellica Bell, his co-host on The Martin Lewis Money Show, asked in a recent live special. But his displays of knowledge are mostly for show: their purpose is not so much to convey information as to demonstrate his mastery of the material, his fitness to instruct. His actual advice, on the other hand, is often surprisingly simple.Consider the “Money Mantras”, the cornerstone of the Money Saving Expert philosophy. Before buying anything, you ask yourself two questions. If you’re broke: “Do I need it? Can I afford it?” If you can afford the item: “Will I use it? Is it worth it?” If the answer to any of the questions is “No”, then it’s clear: don’t buy it.If that seems obvious, then Lewis’s prescription for budgeting is a little more technical. You do an audit of your outgoings, to establish how much you can actually afford to spend. Then you single out a few main categories: these might be bills, holidays, Christmas, savings and big purchases. You open a dedicated bank account for each of them, and use standing orders from your main account to ensure you’re setting aside what you need for every category. It’s fairly straightforward, but takes a lot of effort to set up – a day’s work, in Lewis’s estimation. He calls this technique “piggybanking”, with each account a different piggybank.Money Saving Expert has proved to be very effective at making money, yet Lewis considers it a public service above all. “This is a mission,” he says. “It’s a consumer website, but it’s not there to be all wonderful and give people what they want. All they would want is £10-off shopping vouchers, because they’re fun and most people don’t want to deal with their finances. And we have a job to twist their nipples in any way we can.”Lewis was born in Manchester in 1973 and spent most of his childhood in Delamere Forest in Cheshire, where his father ran a Jewish boarding school for pupils with special needs. Three days before Lewis’s 12th birthday, his mother was killed in a road accident. Losing a parent at a young age “gives you a drive,” he said in a talk in 2014. “Nothing is going to be quite as bad as it’s already been, so you can go for it.”After studying at the London School of Economics, Lewis spent two years working in financial PR, then moved into journalism. He got his first job on air when a cable channel devoted to finance, Simply Money, launched in 2000. Angela Rippon, the TV presenter who fronted the channel, told me that it was Lewis’s sketches that made him distinctive. Alongside his regular reporting, he dressed up as different characters – Dracula, a card dealer – in order to illustrate his points. One of Lewis’s strengths as a broadcaster is that he is not afraid to be naff – in fact, he revels in the naff. “It engaged the viewers in a way that financial reporting had never done before,” Rippon said. He has never been bothered by accusations that he is dumbing down. “I know I’m good at what I do,” he said. “For me, the passion is about reaching real people and getting them to be better on their finances.”In his first year at Simply Money, Lewis asked to be known on-screen as “the Money Saving Expert”. After the channel shut down, he kept the name, paid £100 to a web designer in Uzbekistan – his sole capital outlay in the decade that he owned Money Saving Expert – and launched the site in 2003.Back then, Lewis told me, media coverage of personal finance was limited to “investment, protection, and maybe mortgages if you want to be radical”. What he had in mind was something different: a one-stop shop that covered money as it works in everyday life. That meant advice on supermarkets (“eye-level products are where the profit is”) and where to get the cheapest DVD rentals and perfume. “He has taken it into getting a good deal in every single aspect of your life,” says Anne Ashworth, who edits the Times’s Money section. By moving beyond the constraints of traditional personal finance journalism, he became, more and more, a life coach.What was particularly striking about Lewis’s approach was how confrontational it was. Money Saving Expert’s home page used to have a promise for readers: “Companies try to screw us for profits. Money-saving shows you how to screw them back.” Journalists had long singled out firms that shortchanged their customers, but this was undiscriminating – it suggested that consumers couldn’t trust anyone. In The Money Diet, his 2004 guide to saving money, which doubles as a kind of early manifesto, Lewis argued that it was the job of businesses to make money – “nowt wrong with that”. But for that very reason, he wrote, “all companies are the enemy”.The tools offered by the site don’t always match up to this rhetoric. The Money Mantras alone won’t help you screw companies back. It takes real effort you have to exploit the loopholes identified by Money Saving Expert, and mop up one introductory offer after another. In the argot of the website, people who keep doing this by switching banks are approvingly referred to as “tarts”.Money Saving Expert quickly took off: by 2006, it was getting 1m visitors a month. As it expanded, Lewis’s profile grew. He got an ITV series another series, It Pays to Watch!, aired on Five in 2008, the year the global financial crisis inaugurated an era of perpetual insecurity. In 2012, when ITV launched The Martin Lewis Money Show, he finally got what he had spent years working towards: a programme at primetime. It airs on Mondays at 8pm, between episodes of Coronation Street. The show is centred on questions that Lewis takes from members of the public, at roadshows around the country. It’s slicker than his earlier programmes, but features the kind of sketches that he first tried out on Simply Money, giving it something of a variety-show feel.In June, Lewis recorded a live special of the show at Warwick Castle. A Martin Lewis Money Show flag, featuring coins, notes, credit cards and a piggy bank, flew from the tower. Lewis wandered around beforehand, looking a little nervous. He was more smartly dressed than usual, and boasted to the audience that he had bought his blazer in a sale. “We’re going to save millions of people lots of money,” he told them, “which is why I get out of bed in the morning.” During the show, Lewis reminded everyone going away that summer to pack their European Health Insurance Card by the end of the episode, the EHIC website had crashed.Lewis is fond of saying that he has never been interested in money he’s more interested in what having money allows you to do, and the problems that stem from not having it. He considers himself “a politician with a small p”, whose goal is to achieve “financial justice”. He has tried his best to do this while keeping out of the political fray. But over the past few years, that balancing act has become impossible. Reluctantly, Lewis has found himself dragged into politics.Lewis’s first campaign, in 2005, was against bank charges: the fees levied on customers who go beyond their overdraft limit. At the time, even if someone was just a penny over the limit, they usually had to pay their bank about £35. Since Lewis started campaigning against the charges, 7m template letters – which people fill in and send to their bank, in order to request that the charges be repaid – have been downloaded from Money Saving Expert and £1bn reclaimed. The campaign inspired a song, I Fought the Lloyds by Oystar, a comedy-rock band whose singer had used Money Saving Expert to challenge the charges. It charted at #No 25 and Lewis made a cameo in the video.Not long after that campaign, Lewis deployed similar tactics against banks that had missold payment protection insurance (PPI) to customers. This time, Money Saving Expert’s template letters resulted in as much as £5bn in compensation. More recently, Lewis has taken a different approach, by challenging the government itself. In 2011, soon after it was announced that university tuition fees would rise from £3,290 a year to a maximum of £9,000, Lewis was appointed head of the Independent Taskforce on Student Finance Information, which sought to explain what the new fees would involve. At the time, Lewis said he was “no fan of the changes”, but his priority was ensuring that everyone was properly informed about them. “There were people he could communicate with who wouldn’t have trusted politicians,” says David Willetts, the universities minister at the time.Lewis turned on the government when it froze the repayment threshold – the amount graduates need to earn before they start paying off their loans. Having been set at £21,000, this was meant to eventually increase every year, but in 2015 George Osborne backtracked. Lewis was appalled. In articles and TV appearances, he kept making his case he met with Jo Johnson, who was then the universities minister. In 2017, Theresa May finally relented: she announced the threshold would go up after all, to £25,000, and increase thereafter.Lewis’s journalism offers lessons in self-reliance, ways for iniduals to protect themselves. But he acknowledges that this isn’t always enough. “There are people out there who have less income than the basic minimum they need to subsist,” he says. As part of his efforts towards “financial justice”, he has pledged around £20m to charity.Perhaps Lewis’s most high-profile public intervention came last year, when he learned that his image was being used on targeted Facebook adverts without his consent. Many of them claimed he was endorsing bitcoin schemes that were actually fronts for ultra-high-risk investments one woman lost £100,000 as a result. Lewis approached Facebook about the ads but it failed to take any serious action, so he decided to sue.When he announced the lawsuit in April, it struck a nerve. The story made the front pages. Lewis was all over television, but he looked rattled. Unlike his previous campaigns, this one was personal and he didn’t enjoy the attention. “I do not handle stress particularly well. I am a very shy person,” he told me. Lewis is very protective of his privacy. He is married to Lara Lewington, a BBC presenter, with whom he has a six-year-old daughter. When I joined him on his walk to work, we didn’t meet at his home instead, I waited at a hotel nearby. When he eventually called me to arrange a meeting point, his number showed up as “No caller ID”.It’s tempting to see the Facebook lawsuit as a dramatic battle: Lewis, the people’s champion, taking on an unaccountable Silicon Valley behemoth. Even politicians unwilling to challenge the firm wanted him to play that role. “I have had, let’s say, very senior members of government who have pressured me and said: ‘Please don’t settle. Take it to court, set a precedent’,” Lewis said. Yet his aim was, as ever, more modest. “This is not an anti-Facebook campaign,” he told me, when we discussed the lawsuit last year. “This is an anti-scam ads campaign.” Last week, he announced that he was dropping the case because Facebook had agreed to introduce new measures tackling scam ads.There was a time when Lewis wanted to go into politics. At the LSE, he was elected head of the student union. He ran as an independent the union had previously been dominated by the far left, and Lewis promised to deliver “a student union for all”. Outside the LSE, Lewis was affiliated with the Lib Dems, and led the party in the National Union of Students. “I had no doubt he would go on to be a Lib Dem MP,” said Raj Jethwa, who ran against Lewis in the student union elections.It’s easy to imagine Lewis as an MP: he has the verbal tics of a modern politician, often starting his sentences with a “look” or “listen”. Even after setting up Money Saving Expert, Lewis still imagined he would eventually run for parliament. But when he hit his mid-30s, he decided he wasn’t suited to a career in politics. “I know I couldn’t cope with it,” he told me. “I’m nowhere near as a robust as I was when I was younger.”A few years ago, Lewis applied to be a cross-bench member of the House of Lords – a process open to anyone – and was rejected. He is keen to stress that he doesn’t identify as party political, though he has been approached by numerous parties, including United for Change, the new centrist party. He sees himself “somewhere from a wet Tory, a right Labour or a Lib Dem”. That outlook doesn’t always square with his more incendiary rhetoric. Throughout his career, Lewis has railed against the excesses of business, and seen first-hand how they can affect people he has attacked banks and energy companies. But while he seeks to empower inidual consumers, he stops short of calling for radical solutions that might level the playing field altogether: drastic regulation, or even nationalisation. His work seems to add up to a damning critique of the status quo, without seeking to fundamentally change it.Money Saving Expert operates according to the optimistic principle that if someone knows enough, they should be able to make the right decisions. When I went to events where Lewis was filming and spoke to the people in attendance, I was struck by how clued up they were. They had saved thousands through cashback services, or switching between credit cards – tricks they had learned from Lewis. But in their commitment to saving money, they were willing to put in the kind of time that most people just don’t have.Yet there is more to Lewis’s ambitions than simply educating people about money. He wants to change the way they think and talk about it. “If we take the American look at money, which is where money is just something open that you communicate about, I actually think that is healthier than our more British poe-facedness,” he told me.That reticence can have dire consequences. “I think some of the gender pay gap is because we don’t talk about salaries in this country,” Lewis says. Not discussing money also affects how much we spend on things. “If I don’t know how much you paid for your plumber, how do I know what I’m supposed to pay for my plumber?” Through his work, Lewis meets people with crippling debts, and sees the psychological toll that money can take. He can be emotional on screen, and open about his own vulnerabilities. When people are unable to talk about their finances, he says, it means they are unable to talk about the problems that stem from them. “That’s not good for our society.”That may be slowly changing. McFall notes that many younger people are open about the financial difficulties they face: their high student loan debt, the obstacles to buying a first property. “All of those things mean that financial details about how people live are in the public sphere in a way that they weren’t, historically,” she says. But Lewis thinks there is a long way to go. “We have got rid of the taboo of talking about sex and religion. And thankfully, we’re starting to get rid of the taboo of talking about your mental health. But money’s still there.”Lewis is constantly reminded that his work is incomplete. When I joined him on his walk to work, he told me about something he had recently overheard in a restaurant. A group of young professionals had been sitting near him, discussing which cards they use when they go overseas. “They were all getting it so wrong,” he said, as we walked down Oxford Street. “I found them painful.” He sounded personally affronted. I wondered why he cared so much about what other people did with their money. What was it about the conversation that he had found so painful? “Because it’s fact!” he said, his voice rising in exasperation. “It’s not opinion. It’s just a simple fact.” Like many experts, he seemed to feel that if people just listened to him, it would make everyone’s lives so much easier.This is the territory in which Lewis is still most comfortable: the realm of the indisputable, where one figure is higher than another, where there is no politics or emotion to complicate and corrupt. With money, countless things will always remain uncertain: which stocks will go up, say, or when to buy euros for your holiday. That’s not what Lewis is about. “People want to know what to invest in I don’t know,” he said. “But I do know what the best card to spend abroad is. Manifestly, directly, on a spreadsheet, no question. I know the answer.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f391f450483f7dc35ad4da1496aa7e0d94d5393/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bfcc01a5b6906ad9026dddf9e6d6378","title":"two thirds of british children make music study finds","story":"New research has found that more than two-thirds of young people are active musicians.The report’s authors argue it is vital “to make music an indispensable part of school life”.

And if we’re at school, it’s getting increasingly more difficult to access music in the curriculum where its importance is in many cases being downgraded.”The report’s authors recommend that “public music education funds should be targeted towards those who face greatest barriers to access”, and “those involved in supporting young people’s wellbeing should give greater consideration to the role that music can play, and how young people’s passion for listening to music and their everyday creative lives can be interwoven with wider strategies to support good mental health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438fd3a9e2a7f0009581f1713fab34a06e6c096/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58bf6fb7d61fa6722235cfd4cc88eb8","title":"could speaker john bercow block brexit podcast","story":"Today is the day that backbench MPs in parliament could wrestle control of the Brexit process away from the government.

The PM flies to Brussels on a completely pointless trip, to speak to people who do not want to talk to her, because she has to be seen to be doing something. The government uses dubious tactics to fend off legitimate challenges, the Labour opposition proves once again just how impotent it is, and the Tory press tout it as a triumph for the government. What we are seeing is no more than the twitching of a corpse. Terry PotterWatching this yesterday, it appears that, with a number of notable and honourable exceptions, our MPs have joined in a form of collective insanity, earnestly discussing the number, size and temperament of the unicorns Treeza must bring back from Brussels, all the while ignoring the detailed report that declares the whole of the European continent to be a unicorn-free zone. It must be clear to almost everybody that ‘alternative arrangements’ on the backstop roughly translates as ‘we’ll blag it and hope no-one notices’, which may be OK in Westminster but could lead to violence in NI and Ireland. MrCosmopoliteTo the extent that I’m British I can only feel ashamed at the arrogance and stupidity of this country. To the extent that I’m not, I can only feel angry about my decision to live here and commit money and effort to the place. The sooner I can get out the better, but as it is for business, so it is with families: the costs and losses involved in doing so are considerable. LastNameOnTheShelfSo parla-la-la-iament has voted for the latest fantasy to avoid the Tory Party from splitting. May has another two weeks being PM. Jacob Rees Mogg is another two weeks nearer his dream of a no-deal Brexit so he and his other hedge fund friends can make themselves richer unfettered by any EU directives. And vote-leavers can live happily ever after, even if they are poorer. Us remainers have been ignored again and if, as expected, the EU refuse to reopen negotiations then the blue press will have the headline they always wanted - that it is all the EU’s fault. It looks like we will be forced to go it alone before we can see who is right or wrong. TheDudleyOmmerPlease - going back to Brussels is nonsense. Labour in opposition totally outmanoeuvred in the political playground by the current prime minister. Corbyn is dust, Labour finished. Theresa May won’t stand for re-election and so it will go on post no-deal Brexit. Spencer Leonard WainThe Tories only squeaked a very narrow majority for a switch to the right by imposing a three-line whip on the party, meaning that any minister or junior minister who voted for Cooper-Bowles or against Brady would lose their government job - and any backbench Tory MP who did so would leave themselves open to deselection by their constituency party, egged on by Tory Central Office. The real battle will be when May comes back to the House on 14 February with whatever limp ‘alternative arrangements’, if any, she has been able to cobble together. If the nutters in the European Research Group won’t buy it, the Tory Remainers may have one last chance to demonstrate that they do actually have a backbone - if indeed they do. cripes2How is it possible that Corbyn comes out the bigger loser from last night’s latest episode of the Brexit farce? It surely requires a leader of exceptional ineffectiveness to have presided over last night’s debacle. The Labour party’s role has been absolutely woeful throughout Brexit, right from its failure to campaign strongly for remain in 2016. NowThatYouAskThe serious miscalculation here is that Britain hasn’t recognised the cost to the EU of the single market losing its integrity. In the eyes of the EU, having a blurry border in Ireland sets a precedent that makes their other external borders impossible to defend. This poses a greater cost and a greater risk to the whole of the EU than does a no-deal Brexit and for this reason they will not move. London has miscalculated. stuart255The UK signed up to the Good Friday Agreement after years of hard work to bring about and sustain peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Yesterday we saw parliament vote to refuse to accept May’s deal with the EU if we don’t have the right to renege on the GFA, which apparently parliament wishes to do, otherwise why kick up such a monster fuss over something we don’t want to do. So, parliament wants to scrap the GFA so we can make some trade deals. Can we sink any lower?

But the EU source said May then subsequently failed to offer any proposals during the conversation.Tusk is understood to have replied that the prime minister could not expect Brussels to come to her rescue with a solution. EU officials and leaders are increasingly concerned that Downing Street is seeking to blame Brussels for their failures.After the call, which overran as the two leaders grappled over the next steps in the talks, Tusk tweeted: “My message to PM Theresa May: the EU position is clear and consistent. The withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. Yesterday, we found out what the UK doesn’t want. But we still don’t know what the UK does want.”There are no talks yet planned in Brussels, although the prime minister told Tusk that a face-to-face meeting would be useful in the coming days.The call came just hours after Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, accused May of distancing herself from her own Brexit deal as the EU steadfastly rejected each of the demands the prime minister made in parliament on Tuesday evening over the Irish backstop.“She took distance from the agreement she herself negotiated and on which we had reached an agreement,” Barnier told MEPs holding a debate in the European parliament. The UK government, he went on, was explicitly supporting an amendment calling for the backstop to be replaced by alternative arrangements that were never defined. “Calmly, I will say, right here and now, we need this backstop as it is.”Barnier also launched a thinly veiled attack on the former Brexit secretaries, Dominic Raab and David Davis, as he called for a “lucid and realistic” approach from the UK. “When I hear some people who were even part and parcel of the negotiations saying what they’re saying, it’s tough. I find it hard to accept this blame game they’re trying to play against us,” he said.On Tuesday night, May celebrated the passing of the amendment tabled by Sir Graham Brady sending her back to Brussels to replace the Irish backstop solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.May said the vote would send a clear message to Brussels about what parliament needed for it to support the withdrawal agreement, citing the need for a time-limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the custom union that is envisaged within it.Speaking before Barnier, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, disputed that claim.“The withdrawal agreement remains the best and only deal possible,” he said. “The EU said so in November, we said so in December, we said so after the first meaningful vote in the Commons in January. The debate and votes in the Commons yesterday do not change that. The withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated.”“We have no incentive or desire to use the safety net but at the same time no safety net can ever truly be safe if it can just be moved at any time,” Juncker said.“Sometimes from time to time I have the impression that some hope that the 26 other countries will abandon the backstop – and so Ireland – at the last moment, but this is not a game … It goes to the heart of what being a member of the European Union means. Ireland’s border is Europe’s border and it is our union.”To the prime minister’s wish-list, Barnier also said heads of state and government had already “rejected a limit in time or leaving unilaterally the backstop as that would undermine the very idea of the backstop”.EU diplomats on Wednesday voiced concerns in a private meeting that the prime minister had failed to achieve a mandate from parliament to secure a specific change, and concluded that the UK would have to ask for Brexit delay to avoid a no deal scenario.Juncker said the “alternative arrangements” to the backstop backed by the Brexiters and sought by May did not exist, describing it as a “concept not a plan”. Meanwhile, the European commission announced further no-deal contingency plans affecting students, British researchers, farmers and other recipients of EU funding, citing the increased risk of the UK crashing out of the bloc.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, the government will be handed a three-week deadline to decide whether to fully honour the £9.7bn budget contribution the UK is due to pay into the EU this year.If the UK agrees by 18 April to continue payments and accept EU checks and controls, the EU will continue to release funds for British researchers and farmers and others with existing EU contracts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dbb5f126815751176cc12e132556d61a47e7680/0_309_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4201a43b7bfc0780e1dde180641e081","title":"government looks to exploit labour divisions over brexit","story":"Cash for former coal towns on offer in exchange for backing PM’s revised agreementTheresa May is putting together a package of measures aimed at wooing Labour MPs in leave-supporting constituencies, offering greater protection for workers’ rights after Brexit and, it emerged on Wednesday night, cash for former coalfield communities.The prime minister has asked two cabinet ministers to consult opposition backbenchers over legislation to protect workers’ rights after Brexit, although there is a fierce debate in Labour about how far to engage with the Conservatives.Downing Street also confirmed that extra cash for deprived post-industrial areas was also under consideration, to allow “Labour MPs representing Brexit communities to say they have extracted something tangible”, according to a government source quoted in the Times.As part of the charm offensive, Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Greg Clark, the business secretary, met Labour MP Melanie Onn on Wednesday to discuss further safeguards on workers’ rights.The two ministers have also been tasked with drawing up proposals for enhanced environmental protections after Brexit showing how broadly May is willing to act in her efforts to persuade leave-supporting Labour MPs into voting for a revised Brexit deal.Downing Street advisers pointed to remarks made by the prime minister during Tuesday’s Brexit debate, where she said: “The government will not allow the UK leaving the EU to result in any lowering of standards in relation to employment, ​environmental protection or health and safety.”May had also told the Commons she wanted parliament to be able to “consider any measure approved by EU institutions that strengthens any of those protections” after Brexit in a calculated bid to win over some Labour MPs.Downing Street hopes to persuade a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs to support any final deal that May brings back to parliament, partly because it needs to offset a group of diehard Conservative MPs that will not support any deal with the EU.Onn, who described her meeting as positive, was one of 24 Labour MPs who rebelled against the party whip on Tuesday night, either by voting against or abstaining on Yvette Cooper’s amendment aiming to delay article 50 to buy time to prevent a no-deal Brexit.In 2017, the Great Grimsby MP had proposed a bill that would transpose all workers’ rights protected under EU law into UK law post-Brexit after concerns were raised that some could otherwise be removed by a future government using only a statutory instrument.This applies in particular to rights stemming from case law coming via the European court of justice, such as those applying to equal pay for part-time workers.TUC officials are due to meet civil servants who are supporting the Barclay-Clark initiative on Thursday but there also remains considerable scepticism within the union movement about what is on offer.A TUC spokesperson said: “Working people need a Brexit deal that provides a binding guarantee for existing rights and ensures that UK rights will keep pace with those across Europe into the future.”The TUC added that the best way to do that would be to stick to “single market and customs union rules” – something that May has repeatedly refused to do.Fourteen MPs voted against Cooper, including the former minister Caroline Flint and the MP for Crewe and Nantwich, Laura Smith, as well as veteran Eurosceptics Kate Hoey, Graham Stringer and Dennis Skinner.The 10 MPs who abstained included the junior shadow ministers Gloria De Piero and Melanie Onn, as well as Tracy Brabin, Judith Cummins, Yvonne Fovargue, Mike Kane, Emma Lewell-Buck, Jim McMahon, Ruth Smeeth and John Spellar.Chuka Umunna, a remain-supporting Labour backbencher, said he was “deeply disappointed” by the defeat of the Cooper amendment, as well as a bid by former attorney general Dominic Grieve to stage a series of votes on alternative Brexit plans.“A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the jobs and livelihoods for people across the UK, and these votes have robbed parliament of the wide canvas needed to prevent that,” MP added.Anti-Brexit MPs expressed disappointment at the size of the rebellion, saying it had strengthened the prime minister’s hand in showing that there was not a united front opposed to her. “What’s the point of Tories coming across if we can’t keep our side together?” one MP asked.Labour indicated there would be little meaningful sanction against those who defied the party whip over Cooper’s amendment on Tuesday night. A party spokesman said they would be “spoken to by the whips’ office in the next few days”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599b56d653792c8fbc510c88b502dfb0c9262b5e/0_479_2836_1701/master/2836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c604a0a4ae73f35c157098393d19f9","title":"grand national horse racing ireland entries no deal brexit","story":"The looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March has not deterred Ireland’s trainers from making a record entry of 47 horses for the Grand National at Aintree in April, which is due to be run just eight days after the UK is due to leave the European Union. The entry from Ireland is up from 40 last year, when 16 of the eventual 38 runners were Irish-trained, including the first four home.A no-deal Brexit could pose significant logistical problems for horses travelling from Ireland, however, as it would remove the current certainty of frictionless travel across borders. Predictions of tailbacks at ferry ports would inevitably prompt fears of welfare issues for thoroughbreds moving to and from Britain for racing, breeding or the sales, not least as the majority of horses moving from Ireland to the UK do so by ferry.The number of Irish-trained runners in Great Britain has risen steadily in recent years, from just over 1,100 in 2014 to 1,504 in 2018. Ireland sent 50 runners to last season’s three-day Aintree Festival meeting, up from 40 in 2017, and 150 to the Cheltenham Festival in March, from where 17 returned home as winners.The rise in the number of Irish-trained runners in the UK reflects racing’s enduring popularity in a country where the number of inidual owners and horses in training continued to rise in 2018. The ease of movement between the two countries has also helped to facilitate the Irish challenge at all levels in Britain, however, and any threat to the status quo is a major concern for racing executives on both sides of the Irish Sea.“Whether that’s a horse travelling to and from Britain for a race or a sale, it will cause disruption and delay.”Aintree itself, however, remains optimistic that its showpiece event will not suffer in the fallout from even a no-deal Brexit.“We recognise the huge amount of uncertainty surrounding Brexit right now,” a spokesperson for the track said, “but the government has issued clear guidance that the import of thoroughbreds from the EU into the UK will not be impacted even in a no-deal Brexit scenario as the UK will replicate current systems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d601056cd0f3c3cc1f8703b3ac4eaf803bbd819c/405_0_3304_1982/master/3304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=041dc54298aac43534a1d3145c78aa9c","title":"ireland women ready to tackle englands professionals in six nations","story":"Ireland women’s team will not be overawed by England when they face them in their Six Nations opener in Dublin on Friday, coach Adam Griggs has said.England, who won seven successive Six Nations titles from 2006, gave 28 players contracts this month but Griggs said his players cannot be worried about the disparity and must be ready for the challenge. “In terms of the professionalism, the England squad have always had that depth anyway,” Griggs told reporters. “There’s no bigger challenge than to open the Six Nations against England, they are second in the world for a reason and are a very good side who challenge you in every part of the game.” Ireland finished behind champions France and England in the 2018 Women’s Six Nations Championship and Griggs will rely on captain Ciara Griffin, supported by Sene Naoupu and Claire Molloy, as they look to improve on their third-place finish. “We had a good test against them in November and, while we didn’t get the result, we showed some of the standards and improvements that are required to compete at this level, which was a huge positive for us,” he said.Experienced winger Alison Miller, who broke her leg in last year’s Championship, has been named among the substitutes.For England, Amy Cokayne returns having missed games last autumn due to her RAF commitments. Sarah Hunter will captain the side and win her 109th cap, alongside the experience of Katy Daley-Mclean, Emily Scarratt, Marlie Packer and Natasha Hunt.Poppy Cleall starts for Simon Middleton’s side in the second row, while twin sister and Saracens teammate Bryony will be looking for her first cap after being named as a substitute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68b567c61e939efd5cd67a087647604334f5ba55/28_47_1433_860/master/1433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d686aa5ce6704c19bb5f4d12b71301b","title":"ireland six nations strength in depth ben ryan","story":"When the Six Nations starts we’ll all enjoy picking and poking over team selection and tactics, how the benches have been used and how the coaches have drawn on all their nous to get the results they need. But one thing you won’t hear much about may end up being one of the most important factors of all in deciding the championship – the depth chart.Every nation will have a spreadsheet with each position on it and then the first choice, second choice, third choice and so on. Often it’s also colour-coded red, amber and green – a “RAG” depth chart. Green would mean world class, amber international class and red club class. You want as many green and ambers as possible and it’s a good rule of thumb that a side with real aspirations of winning a Six Nations or certainly a Rugby World Cup would need at least five or more players in that green category.As a coach you work out the permutations for in-game casualties but it’s the injuries that mean a player misses a round, or rounds, that will test teams the most, and this is where the depth chart comes in.In my days at Twickenham these charts were an almost daily conversation topic. You need to see who is the next cab off the rank. I remember seeing one chart in 2010-11 with all the players neatly aligned by position and pecking order on magnetic strips. Below all the names, way down behind the water cooler, was a name the planners had obscured from their gaze and thus their thoughts. Who was this insanely talented No 10? Danny Cipriani.Sometimes the depth chart can be the most important tool of all, as the All Blacks discovered in 2011. Step forward their unlikely hero Stephen Donald, New Zealand’s fourth-choice (at best) fly-half plucked from the banks of the Waikato River and into the World Cup final where he won the game with a wobbly second-half penalty.Normally you look at the spine of the team and how much cover and competition you have there. Hooker, No 8, half-backs and full-back. However, some positions are just as important to a team tactically when you consider all their other positions and strength.For me what’s more important is any position or player who significantly controls decisions for that team. Ireland are the most organised phase team in the world and anyone who comes in needs to know what’s going on in detail. If suddenly they were to have a fly-half crisis, then the equivalent scenario of calling up Donald from a fishing trip and into the Test arena would be a stretch.Ireland have very good depth across all their key players but losing Johnny Sexton or Conor Murray for a prolonged period would hurt them, although their systems might just still nurse them through to a Six Nations title. That’s where their processes actually help them.The same cannot be said about their first opponents, England. Whatever Eddie Jones has up his sleeve, Owen Farrell will help him whip it out and drive it. But they just do not have someone in their planning who can have the same impact. For me that’s why Cipriani would have been in the training squad and very much part of everything.Billy Vunipola is another world-class player you just can’t replace to the same level against the best in the world. Just as in the World Cup, there are easier games in this Six Nations and players will need to be rested when they can to avoid any increased chance of injury.Ireland and England have the cover everywhere else to absorb a raft of injuries except in those talismanic numbers. Wales losing Toby Faletau was a big blow and it is a Six Nations theme that the No 8 position is so crucial to many of the sides. Sergio Parisse and Louis Picamoles are both big for their respective teams as well as their “mana” – a Pacific Islands term for their standing and influence on and off the field. Jake Polledri being injured for Italy is a big blow and a good example of how, even though you might have a depth chart, a serious lack of international quality remains a point of difference.Wales are serious title contenders and much will depend on their opening match against France but with Warren Gatland’s men leadership and experience are also things that need to be thought about when injuries occur. With Leigh Halfpenny out and Liam Williams also a doubt they can’t lose someone of the calibre of Alun Wyn Jones if they are going to have the success they yearn for.Scotland will benefit from the success of their two regions, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and their team cohesion and well-worn combinations may protect them slightly from a raft of injuries but the front five is an area they will hope is less afflicted as the numbers are just not there to deal successfully with any losses.Finally there is France, who need to work out their pecking order. It is that simple for them. Back a consistent group of starters and, if they do, the talent is there to cause real problems to everyone else. Twists and turns aplenty await."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f60bed32e542702e53173f5efae55a7f37992a8/0_178_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f9abe8eed96d077ed6ab26515b3b4a9","title":"tesla factory elon musk layoffs company","story":"Alan Ochoa worked at Tesla’s Fremont plant in California for four years. He was laid off recently along with his entire department in quality control, many of whom were also long-time employees. “I have no idea how they expect to run without us,” said Ochoa.Ochoa predicts Tesla’s “difficult road” will not be helped by laying off experienced staff.He said: “My last repair on Friday was finding a rear fascia was missing a screw so if you pulled on it, it would pop out. I grabbed a drill, the screw, got down on my knees and made the repair myself. No one would have known about it unless they tugged on the edges of the rear fascia like I had made it a habit to do.“But I know once the car starts driving it would become unseated due to the wind pulling it out.”An internal document provided to laid-off employees explained those who were dismissed were selected “by evaluating the criticality of each position, identifying duplicate roles, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each inidual in the company”.Workers past and present believe Tesla is trying to cut costs by getting rid of more expensive, and experienced, staff. The company disputes this.Tesla has a one through five pay ranking system for employees. Five represents the most senior.Anthony Lamendola worked at the Lathrop facility, also in California, for nearly seven years before being laid off.Lamendola, who was also level five, said: “They let all the people go who have been there level rive or more, all level fours and threes, only kept one, two, some threes. I’ve never been late, never called in, never been wrote up in over six years. I’m just am in shock for them to do this and keep temps and new hires.”A current Tesla employee at Lathrop who requested anonymity for fear of losing their job, noted temporary employees and recent hires were kept on, while many long-time employees were laid off as part of the cuts. “This was a move I was expecting due to the high price of raw metal from our president’s tariff war with China,” the worker said. “Tesla Lathrop has a large amount of people that wanted to go union.”Back at the Fremont plant, a current employee who has worked for over four years at the plant was transferred to work on car seats as part of restructuring. He noted many transferred employees took hourly pay cuts, and a few walked off the job as a result.“It seems like they tried to get rid of the older, more experienced guys making more money than the entry level. I personally see and feel this is aimed at the higher-waged employees,” the employee said. “They replaced me with a $19 an hour worker. I make $26 an hour.” He was told his transfer would be a lateral move and wouldn’t include a pay cut, but he’s still wary that his pay will be reduced from changing departments.“I loved Tesla at one point. But four and a half years of living what I lived through, I don’t feel the love, what a good, dedicated employee should feel from a company.”Another employee at the Fremont plant noted that dozens of newly hired workers started training the week after the mass layoff, and that there was also an elimination of overtime. “You get in trouble with one minute of overtime, which is counter-productive because you have people wrapping up earlier than they normally would so they don’t risk going over,’ the worker said.A Tesla spokesperson said: “We are continuing to hire for essential positions.” The company denied senior and high-waged employees were targeted in the layoff.The cuts have been severe. A third employee at the Fremont plant explained his department was cut in half, with the employees who survived this round of layoffs forced to do even more work.“We’re going to have to take over their positions,” the employee said. “We have to do our job, plus the contractor job. Usually we have to work for two people, now, we’re going to have to work for three people.”Tesla has suffered quality control setbacks in the past and workers fear those issues may be worsened by the cuts. Ochoa explained he was making several dozen repairs a day on quality control, depending on what line he was on.He said: “I fear the quality will be greatly diminished. Not all of my repairs were easy to see but would have a lasting effect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835c3800cf2e75604ffc5bc284a8eaa9d7976714/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10948cdc97342cb1ae66b05e2fb4c782","title":"from buffy to boardwalk empire your favourite boxsets ever","story":"Vampire slayers, bootleggers, polygamists and the most evil villain since Satan ... readers respond to our critics’ list with more brilliant binge-worthy TV we missedI’m surprised by the omission of this.

It holds up pretty well on rewatching, although you can see the strain between Ron Moore and Sci-Fi Channel, as it was then, all the more with the passage of time, from the weak “standalone” episodes in season three (Sci-Fi wanted more of those) to the rushed last season (it was supposed to run five seasons, but Sci-Fi would only commit to one more after series three, so Moore cut parts out.) Craig DeBlockMy absolute favourite. Yes, a few poor episodes and sub-plots, but all in all it was brilliant.

Then my husband and I watched it together, again a “box-set” binge-experience. He enjoyed it so much that we watched the first eight episodes in one day. I’ve been casting around ever since for something as good (suggestions welcome!).

Apparently not. A new survey from the research firm Childwise into teenage media habits shows that the New York-set comedy is the favourite programme of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic given that the majority of those surveyed would not have even been born when the series ended in 2004.So just what is it about the lives of twenty-somethings in 90s Manhattan that chimes so much with today’s teenagers? We’d love to hear from readers under the age of 18 about why the sitcom resonates with them, as well as their favourite characters and episodes. We’d also love to know which aspects of the series feel particularly dated or even problematic in 2019.If you’re 16 or over please share your Friends views and reviews in the form below. If you’re under 16 you’ll need to get your parents’ permission before you send a response to us.

He has even played super-villain Charles Augustus Magnussen in Sherlock. But on a stopover in London between shoots, the laidback 54-year-old startlingly reveals that his latest TV role has truly transformed him, prompting a major life-change that still bemuses many around him.The decision that rocked the Mikkelsen clan occurred while he was shooting the show for which he recently won best actor at the International Emmys. He plays Johannes Krogh, a pastor who feels an intense personal connection with God, in Ride Upon the Storm. The ecclesiastical TV drama – written by Adam Price, creator of the Danish political epic Borgen – started in the UK this week after acclaim in Denmark, France and the US.Mikkelsen was raised by communist atheist parents, but says that at first he felt no obstacle to playing a man of God. You don’t have to be a Scottish murderer to act Macbeth, as Mikkelsen has done on the Copenhagen stage. “At the start,” he says, “my own background didn’t matter in terms of making a priest seem real.” But the longer he inhabited the part, the more impact it had. “Acting is a messy thing: it’s partly you, partly what’s in the script, and partly what you can pick up from your research. You’re left with a bloody mess in the end. You tend to want to make sense of it after.”But how could he make sense of playing a priest whose faith is so fervent that at one point, like a desperate lover, he climbs a ladder to kiss a statue of crucified Christ? Late in the filming of the second season, Mikkelsen went to see a pastor himself, and asked to be baptised into the National Church of Denmark. It was rather as if, while paying Petrov in House of Cards, he had gone to the Kremlin and started running Russia.The ceremony was low-key – head splashed three times with holy water, rather than total immersion – but it was such a change that it unnerved his family and friends. “I don’t know if they’ve accepted it yet,” he says. “Actually, I’m not sure I have. I can’t explain it. I think I’d been fighting it for a while. As I get older, I feel it’s important to be true to myself. And this felt true to myself.”His character has a line about churches being “built for the big moments in life”, and he came to the same conclusion. “I’m getting older, experiencing people dying, and to give that meaning, I found churches and ministers to be the right place.” He also wanted to feel part of a community: “For me it was the church. But if you don’t like that, join a fucking political party, join a trade union. It’s important to me that we join rather than disconnect.”For those viewers who may be resistant to religion, Johannes is a very human type of priest, prone to heavy drinking and adultery. Conflict with his sons – one also a priest, the other a troubled drifter – make Ride Upon the Storm a pacy, racy family drama as well as an exploration of faith.“Johannes is a real piece of work,” says Mikkelsen. “One of the concerns that often comes up in drama is how to make the character more likable, so we can relate to them. Actually, why can’t we sometimes just let the characters fucking cross a line, so the audience dislikes the guy and he has to retain our trust? Shakespeare does it all the time, but we’re now so afraid of losing the audience. Real people can be horrible. My family is not sympathetic to me the whole time.” He has two children with the Danish actress Anette Støvelbæk. “Sometimes I need to gain their trust again.”The pressure to follow parental example is another key theme of Ride Upon the Storm, though such an idea never seems to have occurred to Mikkelsen, whose parents were a nurse and bank worker. His younger brother, Mads, is also an internationally successful actor, having starred in movies including Pusher, Casino Royale and King Arthur. Was there some greasepaint DNA further back? “Nothing! It’s crazy, I know. We tend to attribute it to a rebellion. Mads was a street-dancer and I was a juggler originally. The 80s was a good time to try whatever appealed to you. The young generation now are pushed into further education, which I think is a bad thing. We were freer.”Lars says he and his brother are not competitive, and have only been up for the same role once. “It’s not been common, because we are very different-looking. But we were once up for a part Mads got but then couldn’t do, so I did it. It was called The Spider, and turned out to be my breakthrough role.” He soon attracted the attention of UK and US casting directors, leading to Sherlock and House of Cards, after the 2008 crime drama Forbrydelsen – AKA The Killing – led the surprise Scandinavian invasion of worldwide television.Lars had a small role in Borgen, which prompted Price to give him the lead in Ride Upon the Storm. “Adam wanted to do something more political than Borgen, and found that in religion. Nowadays, Norwegian church elections get nasty. By telling the truth about what the church is supposed to believe in, my character gets into trouble. Is that the democracy we want?”In House of Cards, Lars’s character, Viktor Petrov, president of the Russian Federation, has the same initials and KGB background as the real deal. Was Mikkelsen really just playing Putin? “Oh yeah, it was some version of him. But the work I did was how to elaborate on that and not just make it a parody.” Mikkelsen watched films of Putin’s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and was struck by their being soft cops to his hard cop. “Lavrov is much more suave than Putin, who comes across as very callous and harsh. And Petrov, to me, was a suave character.”The final run of House of Cards was unusual because the show had lost the lead, after Netflix’s removal of Kevin Spacey, who played President Frank Underwood. This followed multiple allegations of past sexual misbehaviour on movie sets and elsewhere, some of which he has denied, but which remain in various stages of investigation.Was there a strained atmosphere on the Spacey-less set? “I got in so late in the last season – there were doubts about whether it was going to happen at all – that everyone had settled by then. People just wanted to finish it off as well as possible. So I didn’t really feel any tension. But of course, it was strange that he wasn’t there. That was weird.”Turning suddenly solemn, Mikkelsen says: “All I can say is that he was nice to me, man. And a phenomenal actor. It’s sad, really sad.” Has he had any contact with Spacey subsequently? “No! I don’t know the man. That’s the difference between working in Denmark and outside. I didn’t really know any of the people on House of Cards. In Denmark, we go out and have beers.” Had there ever been any gossip or unease about Spacey on set? “I never heard anything really. But for that final season, I was maybe there four days.”The #MeToo movement has hit Scandinavian showbusiness also, he says: “It’s a necessary movement. Predators have no place in the business.” Scandinavia has always been seen as a very sexually free place. Was that a complication? “Yes, that was an issue. But it has to be freedom with consent. You can always discuss how serious an offence was and whether there can be assumption of guilt without trial and so on. But that’s all secondary to the need to do something – and this movement did something.”Mikkelsen now acts regularly in both Danish and English. Does he think of them as “home” and “away” tongues, or is he comfortable in both? “I’m getting more and more at home in English, but it’s still quite an effort. With House of Cards, I had a Russian accent, which really helps to go somewhere that isn’t English English. For Sherlock, I had a Scandi accent. I’d like to be able to speak English without an accent, but it will take years yet.”He’s currently filming The Witcher, a fantasy series for Netflix based on a video game, and will host more episodes of the factual series Historien om Danmark, a huge hit at home, which tells the story of the people, landscape and wildlife of his nation. It has given him the second surprise conversion of his career. He laughs loudly. “Now I’m the David Attenborough of Denmark!”• Ride Upon the Storm is on Channel 4 on Sunday nights at 11pm, and is available on All 4 now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6db221f1f962675a4efa058612627d4cb2120e5/0_46_3291_1975/master/3291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4420a1081848160d51917e6af531258","title":"mueller evidence leaked online russians","story":"More than 1,000 files shared confidentially appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site, according to court documentsEvidence gathered by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was obtained by Russians and leaked online in an attempt to discredit his inquiry into Moscow’s interference in US politics, prosecutors said on Wednesday.A court filing by Mueller’s office said more than 1,000 files that it shared confidentially with attorneys for indicted Russian hackers later appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site and promoted by a Twitter account.“We’ve got access to the Special Counsel Mueller’s probe database as we hacked Russian server with info from the Russian troll case,” a tweet from the account said. “You can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion. Enjoy the reading!”The tweet was posted in October last year by the account @HackingRedstone, according to the filing. A reporter was also offered leaked material via a direct message the same day. The account has since been removed from Twitter.Mueller’s court filing on Wednesday said the names and structure of folders containing the leaked files matched those used by Mueller’s office when it shared the data, and that these had not been made public.The prosecutors said the filesharing site had confirmed to the FBI that the account which posted the material was registered from an IP address – an identifier for devices connected to the internet – in Russia.FBI investigators had found no evidence that government servers holding the data had been hacked, according to Mueller’s team, pointing instead to a leak on the Russian side. Mueller disclosed the leak in a filing as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Russia’s notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA).The filing argued that attorneys for Concord should not be given access to “sensitive” evidence gathered by Mueller’s team for the case.It said: “The person who created the webpage used their knowledge of the non-sensitive discovery to make it appear as though the irrelevant files contained on the webpage were the sum total evidence of ‘IRA and Russian collusion’ gathered by law enforcement in this matter in an apparent effort to discredit the investigation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa5a0c119b9196b341ebb858f5379523e6fd014c/0_13_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b7a4832a1f1b4e1bc28d78e876c31f6","title":"polar vortex us weather latest temperatures midwest east","story":"Thousands of flights canceled, schools close, and post office halts deliveries as Chicago lows approach recordFrozen Arctic winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the US midwest on Wednesday, as a blast of Arctic air known as the polar vortex unnerved residents accustomed to brutal winters.As of Wednesday evening, at least eight deaths were linked to the system, including an elderly Illinois man who was found several hours after he fell trying to get into his home and a University of Iowa student found behind an academic hall several hours before dawn. A man was struck by a snowplow in the Chicago area, a young couple’s SUV struck another on a snowy road in northern Indiana and a Milwaukee man froze to death in a garage, authorities said.Classes were canceled Wednesday and Thursday in many cities, including Chicago, home of the country’s third-largest school system, and police warned of the risk of accidents on icy highways.In a rare move, the US Postal Service appeared to temporarily set aside its credo that “neither snow nor rain ... nor gloom of night” would stop its work: it halted deliveries from parts of the Dakotas through Ohio.Temperatures in Chicago dropped to a low of around -23F (-30C) on Wednesday, slightly above the city’s lowest-ever reading, from January 1985. With the wind chill factor, temperatures in Los Angeles felt about 100F warmer than Chicago on Wednesday morning.Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the service, said the some of the coldest wind chills were recorded in International Falls, Minnesota, at -55F (-48C). Even the south pole was warmer, with an expected low of -24F (-31C) with wind chill.Temperatures in Chicago were expected to tumble again into the -20s fahrenheit (-30s celsius) early Thursday. Some isolated areas could see as low as -40F (-40C), according to the National Weather Service. Daytime highs could climb into the single digits before warming up to the comparatively balmy 20s (-7 to -2 celsius) by Friday. In many cities, concern is especially acute for homeless people who may have nowhere to stay. Advocates said there are rarely enough shelter beds for all homeless people.“I’m cold and I’m afraid,” Tony Neeley, a homeless Chicago resident, told the New York Times Tuesday evening. The mayor of Lansing, Michigan reported shelters in his city were becoming “overloaded,” and a senior advisor to the mayor of Detroit worried anyone who refused help would “freeze or lose a limb”, according to the Detroit News.Many cities opened warming shelters in government buildings, churches, high schools and charities. At the same time, powerful wind gusts have brought down tree limbs and knocked out power as temperatures began to fall. In Indiana, trees downed power lines as temperatures hit -10F.Some people shared pictures of their pet’s multi-layered winter outfits, and reminded people to bring pets inside.At least 2,700 flights were canceled nationwide on Wednesday, largely in Chicago’s two main airports. Another 1,800 flights scheduled for Thursday were also called off.Amtrak said it had canceled all trains in and out of the city, where Hurley forecast -15F on Wednesday and a record-low -27F on Thursday. In New York, interstates are closed to trucks for fear of invisible “black ice”. Government offices are closed in New Jersey as the western part of the state.The bitter cold is being carried by the polar vortex, an area of low pressure which spins counterclockwise in the stratospheres over the north and south poles. The current of this low pressure area has been disrupted and is now pushing south.Advised to stay home, some Americans are taking the cold in their stride. One Wisconsin woman filled balloons with water and food coloring on her porch railing, to make icy colored orbs. Some set soda cans outside and filmed as the cold caused them to explode.In Buffalo, New York, intense cold and snow storms combined Tuesday evening to produce whiteout conditions. Dashcam footage from one trucker taken outside Grand Rapids, Michigan gave a snapshot of hair-raising driving conditions.“I about just got caught in a giant wreck cars are into other pickups, there’s people hurt.

Now it’s poised to take on a $10bn Pentagon projectFirst it sold books. Then it added gadgetry, groceries and chipper virtual assistants. But Amazon’s latest expansion will take many shoppers by surprise.In the none-to-distant future, US soldiers may rely on Amazon-run systems to trade intelligence, relay orders and call for help. Drone footage might be scoured for wanted men and women by Amazon software. Defense department quartermasters would use Amazon technology to move ammunition and supplies.For Jeff Bezos, it’s not a question of whether customers will mind his company’s defense ambitions, or of complaints raised by civil liberties advocates. As Amazon’s face and founder casts it, the issue is one of patriotism.“This is a great country and it does need to be defended,” Bezos said during an October WIRED magazine summit. “If big tech companies are going to turn their back on US Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.”Now Amazon is the leading contender for a 10-year, $10bn project to accelerate the Pentagon’s move into cloud computing. The Pentagon has said the goal of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure – widely known by its Star Wars-styled acronym, Jedi – is to increase American “lethality” by replacing its antiquated, segmented IT systems.Amazon is widely regarded as the strongest contender for the Jedi contract, which is expected to be inked in early 2019, in part because its ision Amazon Web Services already dominates American cloud computing. One 2017 estimate found AWS held more than half the worldwide cloud computing market. AWS hosts top secret data for the CIA, supports federal agencies from the justice department to Nasa, powers the national immigration case management system and stores hundreds of millions of identity documents.Jedi is expected to inject modern technology into a creaky system. An audit in November found that “systemic flaws” in defense department networks invite hacking, and that the department’s finance systems were so disorganized they could not be audited. Jedi is a first step toward a system that will handle tasks as erse as frontline communications, medical records management and scheduling.The finished system will move petabytes of data between every continent except Antarctica. Service members at the “tactical edge” will be equipped with rugged devices enabling them to check into the cloud. Modular data centers will be deployed to forward bases. The Pentagon hopes those can operate in space.If Amazon wins the Jedi contract and another contract to open a government e-commerce portal, the company will “vault from being a bit player to becoming one of the 10 most-dominant federal contractors, with potential to become one of the largest in relatively short order”, said Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University.Amazon makes no apologies for moving aggressively into the public sector in this way.“We feel strongly that the defense, intelligence and national security communities deserve access to the best technology in the world and we are committed to supporting their critical missions of protecting our citizens and defending our country,” a spokesperson for the Seattle-based company said, responding to a request for comment from the .The proposition that Amazon should defend America can be seen as a logical extension of a mission Bezos laid down in his 1997 letter to shareholders. Amazon targets dysfunctional systems that aren’t serving customers well – from book distribution to home delivery to computer networking – and leads their reinvention.“We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers,” Bezos wrote. “We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages.”Bezos is not the first in his family in the defense sector. His formative influences included his grandfather Lawrence Preston Gise, who is usually described in press accounts as Bezos would’ve known him – a semi-retired rancher showing his grandson how to castrate bulls. Yet Gise also made his living as a defense researcher and manager during the early days of the cold war and ultimately ran the New Mexico office of the Atomic Energy Commission, which was in charge of America’s civilian and military nuclear programs until the 1970s.Big tech and the defense industry have been intertwined since the second world war, when military funding financed the development of the first all-digital computers, said Margaret O’Mara, a University of Washington history professor. That connection deepened as defense money flowed to researchers developing software languages, networks, machine learning and artificial intelligence.“You name it, there’s some defense DNA in there somewhere,” O’Mara said.AWS made a splash in national security circles in 2013 when it launched a $600m cloud network for the CIA and other American intelligence agencies.John Wood, the CEO of Telos, a Virginia-based cybersecurity firm, likened the contract to the “shot heard ‘round the world”.“The CIA, arguably the most security conscious organisation in the world, decided that they were going to move to the cloud,” Wood said. “That really made the rest of the world stand up and take notice, and ask the question, ‘If it’s good enough for them, why isn’t it good enough for us?’”Dozens of agencies – from the FBI to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – are now AWS users.Critics worry both that a “cloud-industrial complex” is forming as large tech companies wade into national security and that rapidly developing technologies will be misused by the military or police. AI-assisted facial recognition software has been an early flashpoint.Amazon’s move to sell its facial recognition software, Rekognition, to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) prompted protest from the American Civil Liberties Union, a small group of shareholders and a hundred-or-so employees. Bezos was not deterred. AWS sales teams have also pitched Rekognition at defense industry events.Amazon declined to say which agencies, if any, are using Rekognition. What is clear to observers, though, is AWS’s desire to make money off defense and law enforcement customers.“They’ve been consistent in selling these technologies at trade shows,” said Shankar Narayan of the Washington state affiliate of the ACLU, which in January demanded Amazon, Google and Microsoft to stop selling artificial intelligence-assisted facial recognition to the US government. “They demo’d it to Ice. The FBI is testing it.”Amazon asserts Rekognition can spot Kalashnikovs and faces from a user-selected watchlist in near real-time. Image recognition software greatly speeds the review of surveillance footage. Speaking at an Amazon-organized conference in 2018, Christine Halvorsen, the FBI deputy assistant director for counterterrorism, said analysts combing video of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre could have completed their work in a day if they had access to Rekognition. Instead it took weeks to track the gunman’s movements.Microsoft and Google have, to varying degrees, recognized civil liberties and human rights concerns raised by the new technology. Amazon has largely declined to address the moral dimensions of national security work.“Amazon really has distinguished themselves as being an actor that doesn’t acknowledge any responsibility and really has doubled down on selling these technologies to the government, the military as well as law enforcement,” said Narayan.The company “has largely hewed to the position that their founder has articulated, that society supposedly has this ‘immune response’ to new technologies like these and things will get sorted out on their own”, Narayan said. “That’s an attitude that rests on a great deal of privilege and doesn’t really account for the human lives that are being impacted by this technology in real time.”Amazon declined to respond to the ACLU comments.Amazon is widely regarded as the strongest contender for the Jedi contract. Competition for Jedi has been bitter. Amazon’s rivals – Oracle, IBM and Microsoft – have protested, unsuccessfully thus far, that contract requirements they claim unfairly favor Amazon.Oracle, a California tech giant, sued the federal government in December. Attorneys for Oracle suggested defense department employees with connections to AWS biased the contract in Amazon’s favor. Notably, the AWS General Manager, Deap Ubhi, spent a year as a product director for the Defense Digital Service, the Pentagon’s tech ision. The Pentagon is currently reviewing Ubhi’s work developing the Jedi contract.The impact of the Jedi contract will reverberate. Neil Gordon of the Project On Government Oversight, a watchdog group examining federal contracting, said the Jedi contract may give the winner a lasting advantage in US government cloud computing – “a monopoly over this area for years to come”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/becf5049382ea31977dcd7a3d1f3737bf42cc466/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b234f8239702460d40953e4fdc00471","title":"cold as of chicago residents make best of life in chiberia during polar vortex","story":"Residents brave the weather to post photographs on social media showing just how cold things have gotIn “Chiberia” – as locals have dubbed Chicago as temperatures have plummeted to -23F (-30C) – it is cold enough to freeze an egg on the sidewalk.

In Chicago, residents have posted photographs on social media showing just how freezing life has become.Local news outlets have made their reporters brave the elements to test whether an egg placed in a frying pan at these temperatures would freeze – the opposite of frying an egg on the sidewalk in extreme heat, which the  Australia team found required hotter temperatures than you might expect.“Cold as ºF,” was the headline on the Loyola Phoenix, the official student newspaper of Loyola University in Chicago and on Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune ran sage weather-related advice on its front page: “Expert: avoid being outside”.But many ignored the expert warnings and ventured into the cold to attempt the “boiling water challenge”, which saw people throw pots of boiling water into the air, which froze before hitting the ground.Others posted videos of bubbles blown outside, which freeze into gorgeous baubles before cracking, or of their fork suspended in mid-air by a waterfall of frozen noodles. The hashtag #DogsofChiberia was created, showing pets rugged up in custom puffer jackets, hats and booties so they could survive a trip outside.Videos also circulated that appeared to show train tracks across Chicago on fire.

Viktor Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, claimed that the rule of law procedure was a “political plot” linked to the philanthropist George Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist who is subject to relentless attack by the Hungarian government.The government also singled out Timmermans, describing the Dutch EU commissioner as “an arm of these leftist liberal Soros-related organisations”.Timmermans, who is seeking to become the next commission president, rejected attempts to portray him as pursuing his own agenda. “In my work on the rule of law I have the full support of the president of the commission and all of the other members,” he told journalists. “I would be more worried if Viktor Orbán started praising me frankly,” in remarks that highlight the depth of tensions between Brussels and Budapest.During the debate on Wednesday evening Hungary’s government received support from conservative MPs, including members of the group created by David Cameron, once he took the Tories out of the moderate centre-right European People’s party. One Polish MEP, who sits with the British Conservatives, said the “European establishment” had been attacking “people you want to get rid of” ever since the moves to isolate the far-right Austrian leader Jörg Haider.Responding to such points, Timmermans said democracy was always invoked as justification for not complying with EU legislation. Hungary had made the “wonderful” and “sovereign choice” to become a member of the EU. “If you choose to become member of a treaty-based organisation, like the European Union, you by that choice say you will follow the rules of that treaty.”The debate came one day after new research from Transparency International showed that Hungary was deemed to have become more corrupt since Orbán returned to office in 2010. According to Transparency international’s latest corruption perceptions index, Hungary has fallen nine points in the rankings since 2012 to a level that suggests “serious problems with corruption”.Kovács dismissed suggestions that Hungary had questions to answer about alleged misuse of EU funds by Orbán’s friends and families. Kovács said it was “a very nice political agenda” for critics, but insisted Hungary obeyed all EU rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eca4a4726a5bcaa9f9c4666f27586f889988125/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=097027fa38834a8d06cd893b59d9d1a8","title":"behrouz boochani asylum seeker manus island detained wins victorian literary prize australias richest","story":" writer on Manus Island wins $125,000 after sweeping non-fiction prize and Victorian prize for literatureThe winner of Australia’s richest literary prize did not attend the ceremony.His absence was not by choice.Behrouz Boochani, whose debut book won both the $25,000 non-fiction prize at the Victorian premier’s literary awards and the $100,000 Victorian prize for literature on Thursday night, is not allowed into Australia.The Kurdish Iranian writer is an asylum seeker who has been kept in purgatory on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for almost six years, first behind the wire of the Australian offshore detention centre, and then in alternative accommodation on the island.Now his book No Friend But the Mountains – composed one text message at a time from within the detention centre – has been recognised by a government from the same country that denied him access and locked him up.It is, he said, “a paradoxical feeling”.“I really don’t know what to say,” he told  Australia in a conversation before the main award was announced, when he only knew of the non-fiction prize. “I certainly did not write this book just to win an award.“My main aim has always been for the people in Australia and around the world to understand deeply how this system has tortured innocent people on Manus and Nauru in a systematic way for almost six years. I hope this award will bring more attention to our situation, and create change, and end this barbaric policy.”Boochani speaks via text messages, because his internet connection keeps cutting out.For an asylum seeker kept in offshore detention to win such a major prize “brings enormous shame to the Australian government”, he said.Accepting the award on Boochani’s behalf was his translator, Omid Tofighian, who worked with interpreter Moones Mansoubi to translate Boochani’s Farsi text to English.“This is one of the most vicious forms of neocolonial oppression that is taking over the world at the moment – and to address this book in this way and to recognise it and draw attention to the narrative it is presenting will have repercussions for many generations to come.”The awards are split into seven categories, which are judged by a panel. In 2017 and 2018, women won each category, and they dominated the winners’ list again this year, with Elise Valmorbida winning the fiction prize with The Madonna of the Mountains Kendall Feaver winning the drama prize for her play The Almighty Sometimes Kate Lilley winning the poetry prize for Tilt Victoria Hannan winning the $15,000 unpublished manuscript prize for Kokomo and Bri Lee winning the people’s choice award for her memoir Eggshell Skull.After last year’s Nib prize, it is the second people’s choice award for the debut, a memoir that tracks Lee’s journey from being a judge’s associate to seeking justice through the courts for childhood sexual assault.She now receives “hundreds” of emails and messages from other sexual abuse survivors.“I respond to everyone,” she said. “Overall I get enough messages of such hope and optimism, and people just actually make life-changing decisions after reading this book, so even though I also get a lot of upsetting messages it all comes good. All I can hope for as a writer is to reach people in some way.”Lee said the unexpected commercial success of the book had given her “the most wonderful gift of freedom to write what I want next”.She is currently working on a series of essays.The young adult prize was won by Amelin and Ezekiel Kwaymullina, for Catching Teller Crow.Western Australian author Kim Scott, a dual Miles Franklin award winner, won the prize for Indigenous writing for his novel Taboo, which deals with a modern community coming to terms with the historical and cultural legacy of a massacre on Noongar country in south-west WA.It is based on an experience in his own country at Ravensthorpe, halfway between Albany and Esperance.“My ancestral country is regarded as taboo by many Aboriginal people because of the killing that happened there in the late 19th century,” he said. “I didn’t even know about it until I was an adult, that nasty edge to our history … the emotional infrastructure of the times didn’t enable or perhaps allow it.”Scott said the novel was for “a lot of us who have been damaged by colonisation, and I would imagine that’s non-Aboriginal people as well ... healing and strengthening our relationship to pre-colonial heritage.“It’s all about foundations and being grounded ... and finding a way for an emotional and spiritual infrastructure. Stories are really important for that but so are things like the Uluru statement. They help us figure out a way to deal with this stuff.”Winner: The Madonna of the Mountains by Elise ValmorbidaShortlist: Flames by Robbie Arnott Ironbark by Jay Carmichael The Fireflies of Autumn: And Other Tales of San Ginese by Moreno Giovannoni The Death of Noah Glass by Gail Jones Too Much Lip by Melissa LucashenkoWinner: No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison by Behrouz BoochaniShortlist: Staying: A Memoir by Jessie Cole The Arsonist: A Mind on Fire by Chloe Hooper Eggshell Skull by Bri Lee Miss Ex-Yugoslavia by Sofija Stefanovic Axiomatic by Maria TumarkinWinner: The Almighty Sometimes by Kendall FeaverShortlist: Going Down by Michele Lee Barbara and the Camp Dogs by Ursula Yovich and Alana ValentineWinner: Tilt by Kate LilleyShortlist: Flood Damages by Eunice Andrada Milk Teeth by Rae WhiteWinner: Catching Teller Crow by Ambelin Kwaymullina and Ezekiel KwaymullinaShortlist: Amelia Westlake by Erin Gough Between Us by Clare AtkinsWinner: Taboo by Kim ScottShortlist: Common People by Tony Birch Too Much Lip by Melissa Lucashenko Blakwork by Alison WhittakerWinner: Kokomo by Victoria HannanShortlist: Wedding Cake Island by John Byron Frontier Sport by Wayne Marshall"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f56e8248378028122c60bc288c2809b782387de/0_162_5909_3545/master/5909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0932d37477fa255fd063e6670f45f6fd","title":"thursday briefing at least theyre talking corbyn meets may over brexit","story":"Labour leader pushes customs union … Asbo-style orders for knife offenders announced … and from penny pincher to our most trusted public figureHello, it’s Warren Murray keeping you duly informed this Thursday morning.Theresa May has met with Jeremy Corbyn as she comes under pressure to spell out what changes to the Irish backstop she thinks she can wring out of a deeply reluctant Brussels. The party leaders held a 45-minute meeting that was described as “serious and engaged” by Labour. Its spokesman added that May was “interested in exploring the details” of Labour’s Brexit proposals which centre on a permanent customs union.May opposes a customs union and Downing Street said that while May asked Corbyn questions, her underlying position had not shifted. Many in Westminster believe the PM could yet be pushed in the direction of a customs union and some Tory Brexiters have hinted they might back it if the backstop goes. The two party leaders will meet again soon, most likely within days.The PM meanwhile has asked ministers to consult Labour backbenchers over legislation to protect workers’ rights after Brexit. Downing Street hopes to persuade a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs to support any final deal May brings back to parliament, partly because she needs their votes to offset diehard Conservative MPs who will not support any deal with the EU. And in debate over post-Brexit immigration rules for EU workers, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley has mocked the idea that they should have to earn £30,000 a year to qualify, saying that as a result of joining parliament “I have met many people who earn way more than £30,000 and have literally no discernible skills, not even one”.Hackers ‘leaked Mueller files’ – Evidence from the Trump-Russia inquiry that was shared confidentially with lawyers for indicted Russian hackers ended up being posted online, US prosecutors say. Special counsel Robert Mueller has disclosed the leak as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Moscow’s notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA). “Irrelevant” files were selectively shared on the internet to make it look like there was no evidence of substance against the IRA, said a court filing by Mueller’s investigators. They are arguing that lawyers for Concord should not be given access to further “sensitive” evidence.Blitz on knife crime – Asbo-style orders against knife offenders have been unveiled by the government. An order can be issued to anyone aged 12 or over believed by police to routinely carry a blade. A breach could result in up to two years’ jail. Separately the Home Office has announced £500,000 to help prosecute retailers who repeatedly sell knives to under-18s. It is believed that at least one large knife was used during the attack that killed Nedim Bilgin, 17, on Caledonian Road, London, on Tuesday night. An 18-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and two others aged 16 and 17 were questioned by homicide detectives yesterday. Police are waiting for tests to confirm whether knives recovered from the scene were used in the attack.Deep freeze – At least eight deaths have been linked to the “polar vortex” weather system that has brought record-low temperatures across much of the US midwest. Temperatures in Chicago dropped to a low of around -30C on Wednesday, slightly above the city’s lowest-ever reading from January 1985. Many cities opened “warming shelters” in government buildings, churches, high schools and charities, while schools have been closed, thousands of flights cancelled, rail services suspended, and trucks banned from interstate highways due to icy conditions. The vortex is caused by extremely cold air rushing south from the Arctic.‘Not good enough’ – Facebook and Twitter may be forced to share data to help researchers identify potential risks to young people’s health, as concern grows over social media’s effects on children’s minds and lives. A committee of MPs has criticised social media companies for refusing to share information that could inform high-quality research. “Their data, which we give them, is both their most valuable resource and it is the only means by which we can effectively study how these platforms affect users,” said Professor Andrew Przybylski, the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute. The MPs’ report calls for clear rules against illegal online content and behaviour, and enforcement by Ofcom for breaches by the likes YouTube, Facebook and Google. Facebook has posted a record profit of $6.88bn for the last quarter of 2018 despite a year of scandals, including new revelations it paid teenagers to install an app that harvested data on their activities.Homeless tragedy – There has been a spate of deaths among rough-sleepers in Oxford. Friends of four men and a woman who have died suddenly in the city since November say the losses are the worst they have known, and further deaths are feared amid freezing temperatures. Oxford has one of England’s highest rough sleeping rate after Brighton, Bedford, Luton, Westminster and Camden. The rate has risen more than tenfold since 2011 from eight to 89 in 2018. The main homeless hostel is full and another has been knocked down. “These deaths impact everyone,” said the Oxford city councillor Shaista Aziz. “Homelessness is a national humanitarian emergency and we are seeing its daily implications in our city.”Better rail for the north – A £70bn plan to transform transport links across the north of England has been unveiled. Transports chiefs claim the 30-year road and rail upgrade scheme will cut journey times, boost the economy by £100bn and “leave a legacy for future generations” including 850,000 jobs. Proposed developments include a new line between Liverpool and the HS2 Manchester spur via Warrington a new line between Manchester and Leeds via Bradford and upgrading lines between Leeds and Hull, Sheffield and Hull, and the Hope Valley line between Sheffield and Manchester. Road plans include linking Sheffield and Manchester via a trans-Pennine tunnel. Transport for the North (TfN) says the proposals will bring 1.3 million people within an hour’s train journey from Manchester airport and at least four major cities.The landmark peace deal struck between the British and Irish governments in 1998 paved the way for power-sharing between unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland and ended a 30-year conflict.Henry McDonald reports on how the Good Friday agreement is once again under scrutiny as Britain approaches Brexit.

The Psychiatric Nurses’ Association (PNA) said given the shortage of staff there would be insufficient nursing personnel to operate all services when the overtime ban was introduced. The union has also said that where the full complement of staff was not available for a shift, the union’s members would not work.It suggested the Health Service Executive (HSE) may seek to use managers to fill gaps and to redeploy nursing staff from the community to acute services.The HSE has said where there is a challenge in staffing an acute psychiatric unit or other residential mental health facility, it has available options. These include the assignment of nurse managers to patient care duty redeployment of psychiatric nurses assigned to day and non-essential services to patient care duty in the residential mental health services and seeking to negotiate a limited co-operation with overtime where there remains a gap.Members of the Irish Nurses’ and Midwives’ Organisation (INMO) staged a 24-hour strike from 8am on Wednesday and plan another stoppage on Tuesday, February 5th. The PNA is threatening full strike action the following week. The nursing unions are seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups in the health service such as physiotherapists who they maintain receive about €7,000 more per year. The unions contend that such pay increases are essential to tackle recruitment and retention difficulties in the health service. However, the Government is holding a hard line saying that bringing nurses up to the levels of other specified healthcare workers would cost €300 million a year plus €120 million in reduced working hours. It also fears that any lee-way it gives to the nurses would quickly lead to the unpicking of the public sector pay agreement with claims from unions representing other sectors.Government sources expect that there will be further contacts with nursing unions over the weekend in an attempt to avert two further work stoppages by nurses and midwives scheduled to take place next week.However, the Government remains absolutely opposed to any general pay increase for nurses because of fears it would undermine the existing public service pay deal and lead to a spate of knock-on claims by other groups of State employees.There is concern in Government that it would be extremely difficult to resolve “because the two sides are so far apart”.“We’ve no choice, we have to hold out,” Government sources said on Wednesday night."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Bitterly cold, windy on Thursday with rain turning to sleet and snow in some areasFriends of have flown in from around the world to say final farewell to young menSchools closed and buses cancelled as \u0026lsquosignificant accumulations in places\u0026rsquoPNA says where full complement of staff not available the union\u0026rsquos members will not workUnderstanding the difference explains why modern lifestyles damage our healthOpinion: Fears about GMO are not borne out by the science a rethink is in orderHarris insists Government cannot offer any increases outside public service dealClaims wildlife driven into extinction as habitat replaced by unnatural conifersProminent doctors line up to support fellow health professionals but wary note also soundedHundreds of tyres burnt on weighbridge at the Border on the side of the M1 motorwayEllis\u0026rsquos Yard in Ballyvolane a site of fly-tipping for almost 20 years, says campaignerEvidence links airborne particles to condition but more studies are neededEurope reaffirms backing for State ahead of visit to discuss no-deal Brexit preparationsGovernment to hold firm against general pay rise following first 24-hour actionKaren McEvoy\u0026rsquos partner calls for inquiry into her death in Naas hospital on Christmas DayThe 95-page document covers all Government areas in the event of a no-deal BrexitSkipping breakfast does not automatically result in weight gain, according to new findingsFr John Cummins died following the incident outside parochial house in Abbeyleix"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3776470.1548879287!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"malthouse compromise an idea whose time has come and gone","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKit Malthouse, right – who gives his name to the Tories’ Malthouse compromise – and Boris Johnson in 2011. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesThe so-called Malthouse compromise was acclaimed this week as evidence that the various wings of the Tory party were coming together on Brexit.But what is the compromise, and does it have any chance of success?It proposes that the UK and EU negotiate a free-trade agreement after Brexit and that technology and advanced customs procedures be used to eliminate the need for any infrastructure at the Irish Border.In essence it resurrects the previously dismissed idea of “maximum facilitation” – or max-fac – which would leave some checks on goods passing the Irish Border to technologies.The compromise is based on a Brexiteer document produced last December, which said there would also be technical roadside checks, even though these could be carried out “at a reasonable distance from the Border”. Customs declarations could be carried out on the factory floor.The compromise will be rejected by the EU even if it is ever seriously tabled by the UK, which is unlikely.And even if such technological solutions are examined as way of handling the Border in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal, industry figures say it would be a logistical nightmare. “Everywhere you turn on this one, it just gets ugly,” said one.Moving the Border down the road does not solve any problems, and will still cause difficulties for businesses that currently move freely over its many crossings – a political red line for the Government.Trade experts say the use of technology and online management tools can reduce the need for physical checks but not by any means eliminate them.Chief executive of employers’ group Ibec Danny McCoy says that “with max-fac, the technology just isn’t there at the moment.”The complicating factor in the case of Brexit is that the UK, and thus the North, is to leave the two key parts of the EU trading bloc, the customs union and the single market.This creates the need for two different types of physical checks as goods cross from the UK into the EU single market. There is a need to clear goods through customs, and also to ensure that rules and regulations in areas such as food and product safety are met.McCoy says the extra burden of a system that moves customs checks to factory floors is an issue.“Some may be able to absorb that, and some can’t. You are passing the burden on to business for something that should be a duty of the government.”Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says making customs declarations electronically is just one part of the required procedure. It also “requires countervailing measures to minimise the risk of smuggling and fraud”, which would probably lead to the physical infrastructure the EU and UK have both promised to avoid.For Verona Murphy of the Irish Road Haulage Association, there is no middle way that could allow the UK leave the single market and customs union and also avoid border checks.“If you don’t have a deal, you are just going to put customs where they were,” she said.The other key issue is controlling and checking the movement of livestock, food and plant products. Currently Ireland North and South are a common area for so-called single phytosanitary region, meaning livestock, plants and food can move freely.Checks are conducted at Larne as products enter from the UK. Under the original, Northern Ireland-only backstop plan, these checks were to be stepped up to meet full EU standards.Unless this plan to increase controls at Larne is revived, then food, plants and livestock would need to be checked at or near the Border.Pat McCormack of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association said neither the haulage industry nor producers would be able to deal with any delays caused by such checks.“I don’t think the trucking industry has the capacity for those delays and I don’t think the producers have the fat in the system to absorb it either.”As the UK erged more in future away from EU rules, this would become all the more important, particularly if food products were entering the UK from third-country markets.The prospect of cheaper goods from other countries competing with Irish agricultural produce is as much of a nightmare as Border checks to many farmers.Joe Healy, the president of the Irish Farmers’ Association, said any revised deal has be similar or better to the backstop, such as membership of the customs union and single market.“I would hate if we don’t get a deal,” he said. “But a bad deal wouldn’t be any better. There’s no point doing a deal just for the sake of it. Having access to the UK market is only worthwhile if the value of the market is maintained.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Tom Honan Officials from the European Commission are due in Dublin next week to discuss preparations for a no-deal Brexit, as preparations for a British crash-out intensify across the EU.EU official and diplomatic sources said while support for Ireland would remain strong and consistent in the weeks ahead, the logic of the situation was that Ireland would come under pressure on the backstop.“There will be no pressure from us,” said one EU diplomat. “But the situation will bring pressure.”EU officials and diplomats believe that with Britain facing a possible crash out, the option of softening Ireland’s stance on the backstop would inevitably be discussed – though all who spoke to The  said that the EU would not try to persuade or pressure Ireland. “It will be your call,” one said.Last night the British prime minister Theresa May offered no new ideas about avoiding a hard border in a telephone call with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and senior Irish Government sources now say they will “sit tight” until Mrs May comes forward with proposals.As relations between Dublin and London grow ever frostier, Mr Varadkar is understood to have told the Fine Gael parliamentary party last night that he told Mrs May it is unusual to go back on an agreement. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney – along with EU leaders – reaffirmed their unwillingness to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, as Mrs May has pledged to her MPs she will do.In London, Mrs May told the House of Commons that the proposal she will present to the EU on the backstop would be based on the concerns expressed by MPs. She said her colleagues had suggested putting a time limit on the backstop or including a universal exit mechanism.“The political declaration already refers to alternative arrangements and raises a number of proposals that can be addressed, such as mutual recognition of trusted trader schemes,” she said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn met the prime minister to discuss his party’s call for Britain to remain in a permanent customs union with the EU. Mr Corbyn initially refused to meet Mrs May until she ruled out a no-deal Brexit but Labour sources said the meeting was cordial, adding that the two leaders would meet again soon.“I set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union, in order to protect jobs and trade. She certainly understood the point that we were making,” Mr Corbyn said afterwards. Mr Corbyn said that he had discussed Labour’s difficulties with the backstop with Mrs May, which the prime minister undertook to bring to the EU, but also reiterated his opposition to a no-deal outcome.In Brussels, the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament that Tuesday night’s vote at Westminster would not persuade the EU to renegotiate the text of the withdrawal agreement. And he counselled Britain against seeking comfort in the hope that the other 26 member states would abandon Ireland at the last minute.“But this is not a game. It goes to the heart of what being a member of the EU means. Ireland’s border is Europe’s border and it’s our union’s priority,” he said.Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz also ruled out reopening the withdrawal agreement and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised Mrs May for abandoning it. “She distanced herself from the agreement she herself had negotiated,” he said. “This agreement will not be renegotiated. We need this backstop as it is. Rejecting the backstop as it stands today boils down to rejecting the solution as we found it with the British.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Carles Puigdemont, the exiled Catalan separatist leader, has signalled that he could run in European elections in order to pursue the case for independence in Brussels.In an interview with The , Puigdemont said he would be interested in running in the May elections if Catalan separatists decided to run a single set of candidates, rather than each party running their own candidates.“If there is a single list, I will support that, I will offer that, and, if necessary, I will participate on that,” he said.“I think it’s interesting for the Catalan process to have a voice in the European Parliament, and to put on the European agenda the right of self-determination,” he said. “It is important to participate directly in the European elections in order to say, ‘that is a European issue that concerns the fundamental values of Europe that needs a political solution and that concerns all the European countries.’”Puigdemont recently launched a new group, Crida Nacional (National Call), to rally support for Catalan independence and work for unity within the movement, which observers say has become ided along party lines, most obviously between Puigdemont’s Catalan Democratic Party (PDeCat) and the Catalan Republican Left (ERC).He rejected suggestions, however, that the independence movement was ided, or that the establishment of his new grouping was an attempt to bridge the gap between the different political parties.“Crida is an attempt to create heterodox space, and non-ideological space, to create more comfortable conditions for the parties in order to share the same objective. It’s in order to facilitate to join, if not parties, then voters.”Puigdemont strongly criticised the impending trial in Spain’s supreme court of 12 leaders involved in the Catalan declaration of independence in October 2017, which led to a period of direct rule from Madrid. Nine of those leaders are in jail. That declaration came just weeks after an independence referendum deemed illegal by Spain’s constitutional court, which was marred by baton-wielding Spanish police hitting out at voters.“We expect absolution,” said Puigdemont of the jailed leaders. “The only proof of a fair trial is absolution, because there is no case. There is no rebellion, no embezzlement of funds, no use of violence to organise a referendum. That is clear. It is a political construction,” he said.He said that the trial was “not acceptable”.Asked about the prospect of civil unrest in the event of a conviction, he said that he aims to “maintain the Catalan movement in a non-violent way”.“There is a risk, of course, to create serious disappointment in Catalan society if our leaders will be condemned to several years in jail.”He said relations had improved under the new Socialist government of Pedro Sánchez in Madrid, which took over from the centre-right administration of Mariano Rajoy, but he was disappointed by a lack of detail in Sánchez’s pronouncements on Catalan independence.“When I asked Pedro Sánchez what exactly was his political project for Catalonia, he is saying nothing concrete, and that is still the position. Nothing concrete, despite some announcements,” he said.Puigdemont also sought to draw a distinction between the Catalan independence movement and some of the nationalist movements which have emerged in European politics in recent years.He said Catalan nationalism was inherently pro-European, and “always linked to modernity”.“Our national movement is not based on ethnic elements. It is impossible to describe ethnically who is or is not Catalan. We are proud of that, we are the result of constant waves of migration,” he said.“To be Catalan is nothing to do with the blood, or the soil, but to volunteer to be Catalan. It’s a modern identity.”However, he added that he did not want to comment on domestic questions, despite a policy of supporting political movements campaigning for self-determination.“We support all the peoples who are demanding to exercise the right of self-determination in a non-violent way,” he said. “But every case is different. And every case must choose its own path.”He said that the departure of the UK from the European Union was a “serious loss”.“As a European, I prefer to see a more large and politically unified European Union, so Brexit is not good news for us. Secondly, I’m afraid it could provoke serious economic effects against both Europe and the UK.”He added that he respected the June 2016 vote, but was concerned by what he saw happening in British politics. “We must not forget it was a sovereign decision of the British people, and they have the right to decide their own future, and we must respect that,” he said.“As observers, we are very shocked with how things are going.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The ministry confirmed Mr Han’s fate in the latter part of last year and has removed him from its latest list of officials in the North Korean government.The newspaper quoted another official as saying that Mr Han was sent to the Komdok mine, in South Hamgyong Province, to undergo “re-education”. That punishment is likely to include long hours labouring in the mine, with little food or medical care should it be required. The North Korean government also has a policy of punishing anyone found guilty of failing the nation by sentencing their immediate family to prison terms that include hard labour.“It seems that a proposal for US-North Korea talks he submitted to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was criticised for breaching doctrine”, the ministry official said.Pyongyang and Washington are locked in talks about a second summit between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump that is scheduled to take place in February.Diplomats have held talks in Sweden in an attempt to narrow the two sides’ differences, although it remains unclear whether either side is willing to compromise.North Korea is demanding the lifting of international sanctions in return for a phased elimination of its nuclear weapons and the capability to produce more warheads. The US has so far been insisting on the complete, verifiable and irreversible destruction of the North’s nuclear capabilities, although there have been hints from Mr Trump that he might be willing to reduce some of his demands.Mr Han’s fall from grace may have been the result of suggesting that North Korea give ground to the US.A defector who previously served in the North Korean government told the newspaper that, “Being sent to the Komdok mine is the harshest of re-education sentences and means that he just escaped being sent to a concentration camp”.It has also been suggested that Mr Han’s long links with the US - he served as deputy chief of the North’s mission to the UN for four years from 2002 and was appointed director-general of the Foreign Ministry’s US affairs ision in 2015 - caused him to come under suspicion of being an agent for the US.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Brexit date might need to be delayed, says Jeremy HuntCharges dropped against Abu Hamza\u0026#39s son after arrest linked to doorman\u0026#39s murderVenezuela opposition leader \u0026#39held secret meetings\u0026#39 with military leaders in bid to oust MaduroPolar vortex blamed for at least eight deaths as deep freeze grips US MidwestA Very English Scandal series 2 will focus on the \u0026#39Dirty Duchess\u0026#39 orce caseHeated driveways, setting train tracks on fire and other ways the US deals with heavy snowWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?KGB spy museum opens in New YorkDavid Suchet interview: \u0026#39I played Poirot just as Christie wrote it\u0026#39Sugar, spice, and a touch of tragedy: the Waitress recipe for Broadway musical success\u0026#39God wanted Trump as president,\u0026#39 says White House press secretaryComment: This ‘unicorn’ could make the backstop vanish, but Parliament needs to stick to its gunsComment: British fury at the arrogant, high-handed EU could unite the country to back a WTO dealUK\u0026#39s coldest night of winter as temperatures plunge as low as -11C Power outages hit 45,000 homes in Sydney as temperatures soarBrussels orders Britain to pay £39bn Brexit bill even if there is no dealIron Age Britain beer-making evidence discovered in road works Pharmacists and physios to take over routine GP appointments -

Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.Apple and Facebook have found themselves arguing over user privacy and the protection of personal data in recent months. Tim Cook criticised Facebook over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica crisis and suggested it was different because it chose not to make its customers its products – which Mark Zuckerberg said was extremely glib and did not represent how Facebook thinks about its customers.Despite those fallouts, Facebook and Apple rely heavily on each other. That arrangement is said to have led to problems in the past, with Apple unable to punish Facebook without threatening many of the biggest apps on its platform.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t.

What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years.

His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers.

All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.Affleck\u0026nbsphas since appeared to confirm rumours of his departure from the role.Sharing the\u0026nbspDeadline\u0026nbsparticle that said he was passing the torch to the next generation of Bruce Wayne, he tweeted: “Excited for #TheBatman in Summer 2021 and to see @MattReevesLA vision come to life.”It is unclear as to whether Affleck\u0026nbspever plans to return to the role. According to\u0026nbspIMDb, cast members for the new film will include Joe Manganiello, JK Simmons and Jeremy Irons. There is currently no news as to who might replace Affleck.\u0026nbspHinting at what\u0026nbspThe Batman\u0026nbspmight be about, Reeves\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspThe Hollywood Reporter\u0026nbspin an interview this week: “It’s very much a point of video-driven, noir Batman tale. It’s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it’s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional.”He added that he was focusing on the superhero’s detective roots and plans on having him face off against “multiple villains”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

MPs voted on Tuesday to remove the Irish backstop from Theresa May’s Brexit deal and find an alternative, as yet unknown, replacement. Companies in Northern Ireland are “upset and confused” by the result of the votes, according to Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, which represents 5,500 firms in the region.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He didn’t specify which markets, although China is a racing certainty.\u0026nbspBut such a move makes all kind of sense, particularly in the aforementioned where local champion Huawei has been putting out whizzy competing handsets to tempt patriotic Chinese buyers.\u0026nbspApple has been squeezing its consumers for a long time. Will this be enough to stop the pips from squeaking?\u0026nbspThe talk of prices being ‘slashed’ certainly looks\u0026nbspover done. The iPhone is going to remain a pricey piece of kit, and recent upgrades have been obeying the law of diminishing returns.\u0026nbspThe phenomenon of people changing their handsets less often is an industry wide one, and it’s an open question as to whether relatively limited price cuts in some markets will be enough to turn back that particular tide.\u0026nbspThe reason investors have less reason to be concerned than it might appear is that the iPhone is not the only string to Apple’s bow.\u0026nbspA notable feature of the results was that while revenues from sales of the device fell by 15 per cent, group revenues fell by just 5 per cent as other parts of the business grew.The money taken in\u0026nbspfrom selling Macs increased by 9 per cent, wearables, home and accessories (iWatches, speakers, headphones) put on 33 percent,\u0026nbspthe iPad\u0026nbsp17 per cent.\u0026nbspThe most important, and closely watched, line was, however, services.

But it is closing, and the margins are stunning.\u0026nbspApple’s shares have lost nearly a third since October, driven by a widespread tech tumble as well as its own problems. It has also surrendered its much vaunted status as the world’s biggest company by market value. Accustomed to dazzling investors, the weather looks set to be cloudy for some time to come and full year revenues will likely be down on last year.\u0026nbspStill, Cook is sitting on a near $250bn cash pile, and the stock’s fall may have been over done. Big investors seem to think so. They’ve started to order portions of Apple pie, scenting a buying opportunity at the current levels.

Holly Exley still remembers her most outrageous offer of free work.Exley is a watercolour illustrator with a decade of experience making artwork for top-end clients, from monthly commissions of animals for BBC Wildlife Magazine, to mouthwatering illustrations for the Esquire Food and Drink Awards. But not that long ago a luxury luggage company approached her to work “in collaboration” on illustrations for their products – in return for a free suitcase.“It devalues the industry,” Exley says. “Illustration is used everywhere: from advertising to animation, packaging to publishing. It has value, and illustrators spend years honing their craft and promoting their talents, only to be asked to give it all away for free.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhy do female freelancers earn less than male counterpartsSmall Talk: Half the workforce could be freelance soon, but ministersExley is one of hundreds of freelancers who have signed a #nofreework petition\u0026nbspstarted by The Freelancer\u0026nbspClub, a support network for freelancers in the creative industries, pledging not to accept unpaid work. The campaign, which started in 2016, is stepping up a notch in 2019 and calling for legislation to give freelancers more rights.\u0026nbspThe problem of free work is getting worse as the UK’s freelance army grows. The number of self-employed people in the UK has increased from 3.3 million in 2001 to 4.8 million in 2017, according to the ONS, contributing the most to employment growth since the financial crisis. Yet self-employed workers earn on average £240 a week, compared to £400 by those in full-time work.\u0026nbspMany young people entering creative industries like photography, graphic design or illustration take free work in return for exposure, hoping it leads to paid work further down the line. But the practice is not uncommon among experienced freelancers. In 2017, the Association for Independent Professionals estimated that free work costs freelancers with an average of seven years’ experience £5,394 a year. The law currently offers no protection and many creatives keep quiet for fear of a backlash from potential clients. \u0026nbsp“So many freelancers are scared to say anything, they are scared to name any company for fear of the backlash,” says Matt Dowling, founder of The Freelancer Club and a former freelance photographer. Since starting the campaign, he has been shocked by the stories of unpaid work and its consequences. One make-up artist couldn’t feed her children after her successful business turned into “an epidemic of unpaid work”\u0026nbspbecause so many other artists were willing to work for free.“I can’t imagine people approaching a plumber or a lawyer and asking them to work for free,” Dowling says. “But anything like photography\u0026nbspor design, anything that’s deemed to be a privilege, it doesn\u0027t get valued. Freelancers are accepting that work, and as soon as companies see that, they decide to save money.”Dowling started The Freelancer Club in 2016 after a company refused to pay him for photography work worth £11,000. It\u0026nbspnow has 30,000 members on a tiered payment scheme. Membership gives freelancers access to guides, discounts, access to paid work and legal advice. “Freelancers are told from an early stage that it’s a rite of passage to work for free,” he says. “It’s absolutely nonsense. Being an ethical company actually helps the bottom line. Millennials prefer to work for ethical companies, for instance.”Khandiz Joni is the\u0026nbspfounder of Novel Creatives, a booking platform for\u0026nbspsustainable and ethical fashion and lifestyle brands to find photographers, hair and make-up artists and other creatives\u0026nbspaligned with their ethos.\u0026nbspJoni says it has pledged not to promote free work through the #nofreework campaign.“We support this because we are freelancers and understand the very real and direct impact it has on our own livelihoods,” Joni says. “Also, working with brands that are in the area of ethics and sustainability, we feel that it is important that all parties need to be paid fairly for their work and expertise, if these brands can make claims of their fair wage principles.”Working for ethical brands and charities is just one of the grey areas Dowling and The Freelancer Club have identified. Others include work experience, collaborative projects like test shoots, where no one stands to gain, and speculative work, which can be requested by agencies for clients in anticipation of paid work.\u0026nbspBut Dowling says companies should never ask a freelancer to do professional work for free if they intend to gain from it commercially. He is calling for the UK Government to introduce legislation similar the Freelance Isn’t Free Act in New York, which establishes and enhances protection for freelance workers, specifically the right to a written contract, timely and full payment and protection from retaliation.\u0026nbspAnna Codrea-Rado, a freelance journalist and author of The Professional Freelancer newsletter, says the onus needs to be taken off the freelancer to go against a system that is already rigged.\u0026nbsp“The conversation needs to shift away from asking freelancers not to work for free, to demanding that companies not exploit the self-employed workforce,” she says.\u0026nbspThe hidden cost of self-employmentCodrea-Rado says it is not uncommon for well-established journalists to say that young journalists should never work for free. “That is a privileged statement to make that puts the onus on those at the very beginnings of their career to fight against a broken system that they did not break,” she says. “We shouldn\u0027t be telling young journalists not to write for free, it simply shouldn\u0027t be legal for a publication to commission a piece of writing without paying for it.“Exley frequently discusses issues around work and pay on her YouTube channel, which has 32,000 followers. She agrees that legislation is necessary to raise the profile of the issue and to provide security for freelancers as it becomes more popular for young creatives to go it alone.\u0026nbsp“I often feel vulnerable as a freelancer,” she says. “We don\u0027t have many of the benefits of traditional employment. We need a better support system to rely on and laws we can enforce.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Companies in Northern Ireland are “upset and confused” by the result of the votes, according to Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, which represents 5,500 firms in the region.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But no guarantee on funding has been given after 2020, leaving maintained nursery schools unable to plan and budget for the future.Government must take ‘urgent action’ to stop nursery school closuresMs Powell, who is chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Nursery Schools, Nursery and Reception Classes, said: “The loss of maintained nursery schools would be a terrible act of social vandalism.“Unless action is taken we could see the mass closure of these vital institutions, with tens of thousands of children losing the specialist care that is making all the difference in closing the social mobility gap.“Whilst we often hear warm words about the excellent education nursery schools provide, this needs to be urgently backed up by secure, long term funding, so that we can safeguard the future of nursery schools across the country.”Beatrice Merrick, chief executive of national early years charity Early Education, said: “Without the supplementary funding virtually all nursery schools are at risk of closure.“Most have been through multiple rounds of funding cuts already, have restructured and cut costs wherever they can, and in an increasing number of cases now have recurrent deficits, so trying to find ways to cope with the loss of an average of a third of their budgets is just untenable.”Nadhim Zahawi, minister for children and families, said: “We want every child to have the best start in life, which is why we are spending more money than ever before to support early years education and childcare – around £6bn a year by 2020.\u0026nbsp“However, we recognise the need to monitor costs and the childcare provider market.“Maintained nursery schools make a valuable contribution to improving the lives of some of our most disadvantaged children, which is why we are providing local authorities with around £60m a year up until 2019-2020 to protect maintained nursery schools funding.“The position beyond this will be determined by the next spending review.”Department for EducationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Poor students may therefore be more inclined to live at home and unless there is a high-tariff university nearby, this will restrict their choice.”Cambridge to offer \u0027dozens\u0027 of poorer students free year of studyMr Barton called on the government and top universities to do more to widen access. “The student loans system stacks the odds against those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds,” he added.A spokesperson for the Russell Group said: “These are sobering figures and they should strengthen our resolve to continue opening up top universities to young people from all walks of life.\u0026nbspThis is a big, complex social problem with no quick fixes – but recent years have seen important progress and universities, schools, government and parents must work together to keep it on track.”Sir Peter Lampl, founder of social mobility charity Sutton Trust, told The Independent: “It is worrying to see that there has been limited progress in closing the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students getting into top universities.\u0026nbspAll young people, regardless of their background, should have a fair chance to get into these top institutions.”He added: “Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are often not getting the advice and support they need in a highly competitive admissions process.“It is vital that we ensure that all young people, regardless of where they live or go to school, have access to high quality careers advice and guidance that allows them to make informed choices.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.Apple did not say in which countries it would adjust iPhone prices. Resellers in China already began cutting iPhone prices earlier this month after Apple lowered its sales forecast for the quarter ended in December.Apple profits fall as demand for iPhones slowsThe company priced its new iPhone XS, which was released in September, at $999, the same price in U.S. dollars as its predecessor, 2017\u0027s iPhone X.That worked for U.S. consumers, but in countries such as China and Turkey the local currency had fallen so much against the surging U.S. dollar, it made the phone significantly pricier than its predecessor a year before. Apple had essentially asked the consumer to bear the cost of the strengthening dollar.On Tuesday, Cook said Apple will adjust foreign prices in some markets by resetting them at or close to what they were one year before in local currencies. Effectively that means Apple will absorb the cost of the strengthening dollar.We\u0027ve decided to go back to (iPhone prices) more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas, Cook told Reuters in an interview.In the company\u0027s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Cook also highlighted the impact of foreign exchange problems in Turkey, where he said the local lira had depreciated by 33 percent against the dollar and Apple\u0027s sales were down by $700 million from the previous year. In November, Apple also cited currency pressure on its prices in Brazil, India and Russia.Apple has not said when or how often it might reset its prices because of foreign currency changes.Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the price adjustments may not extend to its services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store.While that unit beat analyst expectations with $10.8 billion in sales in the quarter ended in December, growth has slowed compared to previous years.Maestri said slower growth was partly because prices rose for users in non-U.S. markets.Roughly 60 percent of our services business is outside the United States, and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months, Maestri said. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next.

Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Annie Mac and Eric Prydz are among the events\u0027s DJs, along with\u0026nbspGilles Peterson and Kaytranada.Tickets will go on sale this Friday, 1 February at 9am.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

But does one exist? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentIs the prime minister looking for something that isn’t actually there?Theresa May is returning to Brussels to try to renegotiate the European Union withdrawal agreement to make it acceptable to a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.But what will she ask for?On Tuesday night almost all of her party’s MPs and\u0026nbspa majority of the Commons voted in favour of an amendment put forward by the senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady calling for the Irish backstop (the insurance clause that says the entire UK will remain in an EU customs union if there is no EU free trade deal struck that manages to avoid a hard border in Ireland) in the withdrawal agreement to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDowning Street’s logic is that, if the EU agrees\u0026nbspto this, the agreement she brings back will finally make it through the Commons.But what might these alternative arrangements be? Even if the EU was prepared to reopen the withdrawal agreement, do they really exist?How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?The “Malthouse Compromise”, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party, refers to a “protocol” to replace the backstop in a document put out last month called “A better deal”. This was written by Shanker Singham of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank with opaque funding.This protocol offers various technological and procedural measures – including, among other things, customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU – which would supposedly eliminate any new frictions on the Irish border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But how credible is it?Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says its provisions for policing standards and preventing smuggling would not be secure.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform agrees that the document is not\u0026nbspcredible in terms of policing.“Can you do it without physical infrastructure? Maybe. Can you do it without a significant uptick in ‘associated checks’? I don’t think so. Would it still constitute a border in many peoples’ minds and be disruptive? I think yes,” he says.In other words, if the Singham\u0026nbspplan is the only alternative to the Irish backstop that Theresa May can offer to Brussels her renegotiation effort looks likely to be short and unsuccessful.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Still,\u0026nbspit would be foolish not to listen to the concerns of a group of companies that between them sell about half the\u0026nbspnation’s groceries.Their warning is backed up by evidence from several sources. Government figures show the UK produces 48.7 per cent of the food it eats and the proportion has been steadily declining. The rest is imported, with about two thirds of that coming from the EU.\u0026nbspAdditional border checks on thousands of containers of food each year could mean significant delays which are a particular problem for fresh fruit and vegetables (the very items we are most dependent on imports for,\u0026nbsp84 per cent of our fruit and 48 per cent of our vegetables\u0026nbspnot being homegrown).\u0026nbspEventually, supermarkets may be able to re-engineer their supply chains to restore the flow\u0026nbspof fresh produce but many goods will undoubtedly be more expensive.Rising prices of fruit and vegetables will lead to 12,400 additional cardiovascular deaths between 2021 and 2030, research published in the British Medical Journal this week estimated.While some have argued that Brexit presents an opportunity to reduce\u0026nbspour reliance on food imports and boost British farming, this cannot happen in the short term.And even if domestic production were\u0026nbspto be ramped up drastically, UK climate conditions will not be suitable for all crops. We could heat thousands of greenhouses of course, but that raises significant environmental questions.There is a saying among optimists\u0026nbspthat when life give you lemons, you should make lemonade.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

Several members of his frontbench also dodged the vote.The spokesman denied the leader’s office had given a “nod or a wink” to MPs from Leave-supporting constituencies that they could safely defy orders over the issue to preserve local support.\u0026nbspAsked how Mr Corbyn would respond to the rebellion, his spokesman said they would be “dealt with by the whips office in the usual way”, without giving more detail.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentBut he added: “There will be some fraying around the edges, but we’ve kept the party united both externally and internally.”Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn himself later\u0026nbspsaid he was “disappointed” that some Labour MPs had voted in favour of the Brady amendment, allowiung Ms May a mandate to keep negotiating on her deal,\u0026nbspon Tuesday night.“I’m very disappointed of those that chose to vote with the Conservatives last night on those issues.”Asked if he would take disciplinary action against MPs who rebelled, he said: “We will be having discussions with them.”Remainers within the Labour movement, and also some close leftwing allies of Mr Corbyn, attacked the rebels for “riding to the rescue” of the PM.Senior MP Chuka Umunna – a champion of the People’s Vote campaign – said he was “angry” and disappointed at the Cooper amendment’s failure to pass.There were calls from some Corbyn allies for MPs to be deselected. Commentator Paul Mason tweeted: “Withdraw the whip, expel from the Labour party and select socialists instead of xenophobes.”\u0026nbspThe group who rebelled included veteran left-winger Dennis Skinner, Caroline Flint, John Mann, Graham Stringer and Kate Hoey.

Some of the contracts last two or three years, meaning payments could continue for some time.“As highlighted on many occasions, all commitments taken by the 28 Member States should be honoured by the 28 Member States,” A statement released by the European Commission said.“This is also true in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, where the UK would be expected to continue to honour all commitments made during EU membership.”The statement continues: “Today’s proposal enables the EU to be in a position, in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, to honour its commitments and to continue making payments in 2019 to UK beneficiaries for contracts signed and decisions made before 30 March 2019, on condition that the UK honours its obligations under the 2019 budget and that it accepts the necessary audit checks and controls.EU takes less than 10 minutes to reject MPs’ demand to bin backstop“This would help mitigate the significant impact of a “no-deal” scenario for a wide range of areas that receive EU funding, such as research, innovation or agriculture.\u0026nbsp“This issue is separate from and without prejudice to the financial settlement between the EU and the United Kingdom in a no-deal scenario.”Officials admit they cannot force the UK to make any payments once it has left the bloc, though they hope Britain\u0026nbspwill take up the offer.Though the EU has ruled out doing ‘side deals’ with the UK to soften a no-deal Brexit, the move on the budget contributions suggests the commitment is open to interpretation.\u0026nbspThe Commission says its no-deal planning “cannot replicate the withdrawal agreement”, is “unilateral” and is aimed at mitigating the “most disruptive effect on EU27 stakeholders”. It has stepped up preparations in recent weeks and months, with 88 stakeholder notices and 18 legislative proposals.What just happened with Brexit- and what happens next?EU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May toldMay wins backing to renegotiate backstop but EU says noOn Wednesday it also unveiled measures to protect the Erasmus international study programme, confirming that it would honour the overseas placements of UK and EU27 students who were abroad at the time of a no-deal. This commitment affects around 7,000 UK nationals on the continent and 14,000 EU nationals in the UK.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said last year that “the Government would not pay the terms of the financial settlement, as agreed with the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement” in the event of a no-deal, because\u0026nbsp”there’s no deal without the whole deal”. It is not clear whether the Government’s policy has shifted since Mr Raab’s departure, however, with the issue of the orce bill falling off the agenda and the focus moving to Northern Ireland.In September Theresa May said “the position changes” on the issue of the payments if the UK left without a deal: leaving herself room for manoeuvre.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

UK infrastructure projects.The committee argued\u0026nbspthat Britain should give swift and serious consideration to\u0026nbspcreating a state-backed infrastructure bank to replace funding the country will lose.Baroness Falkner of Margravine, who chairs the committee, said: “For the last 45 years the UK has relied on the European Investment Bank to invest in all manner of vital infrastructure projects such as Crossrail, London’s ‘Super Sewer\u0027, the expansion of Manchester’s tram network and Scotland’s Beatrice offshore windfarm.“The UK’s infrastructure, and the industries that depend on infrastructure spending, will be hurt if the government does not quickly find a way of plugging the funding gap that will be created if access to the EIB is lost after Brexit.“We’re calling on the government to give serious and swift consideration to the creation of a UK infrastructure bank.”\u0026nbspThe Liberal Democrat peer also urged Ms May\u0026nbspto come clean about why the government is not claiming Britain\u0027s share of €7.6bn\u0026nbspfrom the EIB as part of its Brexit plans.Under the terms of Ms May\u0027s Brexit deal, the UK will receive the €3.5bn\u0026nbspof capital it has paid into the EIB but it will not receive any share of the bank\u0027s profits, which the committee says could amount to €7.6bn.Responding to the report, a Treasury spokesperson said: “As we leave the EU, we will get every penny of the more than £3bn we put into the European Investment Bank back to invest in UK infrastructure. We also have assurance that existing UK projects will face no disruption from our exit.Brussels says UK should still pay into EU budget after no-deal Brexit“This is just one of part of a much larger settlement that we have negotiated with the EU, which honours our commitments and is a good deal for taxpayers.“We are investing record amounts in Britain’s infrastructure, with funding for roads, railways, schools and hospitals reaching levels not sustained for forty years.”Ms May was recently criticised for choosing to launch her long-term plan for the NHS from a hospital that was built with £50bn of EU financing.Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital received £56m from the EIB\u0026nbspfor reconstruction work in 2013, according to research by the Best for Britain campaign.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing.I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.#What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series. Stay strong, viewers.Celebrity Coach Trip, Roxanne Pallett: “I knew as soon as Jedward got on the coach it was going to be fun.”The One Show, Matt Baker: “If you haven’t seen The Greatest Dancer yet, watch it on the iPlayer. It’s well worth it.”And Icons, Kathleen Turner: “Charlie Chaplin used his films to try and smash social barriers.”No, Charlie Chaplin used his films to try and make people laugh.Tell the BBC to try it some time.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “Every cloud. We lost the NTA, but I got a kiss off Gemma Collins.” Yeah, every cloud’s got a gigantic p***-storm.No one from Peaky Blinders bothering to turn up to the NTAs to thank: “The best fans a show could hope for.”Celebrity Coach Trip contestants Jedward ­providing the finest argument yet for theof a hard Irish border.Sheridan Smith’s accent doing the London to Doncaster trip in . seconds flat, on that Cleaning Up tosh.The Greatest Dancer’s pre-performance sob stories straying horribly close to moral blackmail territory.And E fly-on-the-wall moron Vogue Williams asking: “Is Gandhi the Dalai Lama ” in total ­ignorance of this remarkable man’s wisdom, serenity and even his landmark campaign for Dolce  Gabbana’s Light Blue fragrance . . .Martin Keown: “It should be a great spectacle, so sit back, hide behind the sofa and enjoy it.”Phil Thompson: “You never know what’s going to happen and that’s exactly what happened.”And Paul Merson: “If he was at Arsenal doing this, he wouldn’t be doing it.”.This week’s winner is the bellowing great Orca herself, Gemma Collins, and Sugar, from Total Drama Island.Sent in by Rich, of Lincolnshire.

The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t. They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for. Even a dejected Corbyn has conceded he now needs to talk to Mrs May.The PM needs to know precisely what she’s demanding from Brussels — and we’re far from confident the EU will see reason.

It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement. It is never sensible to give into blackmail.If the choice is between No Deal and surrendering part of our country, we will choose No Deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW. Divert the money into our beleaguered and creaking infrastructure. And when a tragedy occurs overseas — sure, splash the cash.Anyway, Penny — hope I’ve helped by starting the conversation. Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown.

Corporation bosses were hauled before the Commons Public Account Committee to explain a staggering poundmillion cost overrun for the E project, creating the soap’s Albert Square.During the -minute hearing, Labour ’s Chris Evans tackled BBC Content’s chief operating officer Richard Dawkins over specications for the project.Quizzing the broadcasting executive over an apparent delay between the BBC and contractor Wates in selecting raw materials, the MP said: “There seems to be an issue with bricks.” Mr Dawkins confirmed: “Before going into contract, we felt it was important to look at a range of dferent types of brick and, very importantly, bring in our production colleagues to review those bricks themselves given, ultimately, they’re the ones who will be operating the set.  “We did that in advance of letting the contract with Wates. “The objective for the ‘front lot’ is to replicate the existing Albert Square site - making sure we have that right was really important.” In a bizarre exchange which could have come straight from “mockumentary” WA, Mr Dawkins admitted the selection process took “weeks”. Baffled Mr Evans said: “Wouldn’t it have been easier just to go to a DIY shop and compare them ” But the BBC boss hit back: “It’s quite important that we replicate the look and feel of Walford and Albert Square. “It’s Victorian era, it’s an extensive build around the entire Square, so this is really important.”  He insisted: “If you look at the current set there are dferent shades of brick. “This is not just about going and finding off your local DIY store a limited choice. “It was the right thing to do.” The E project to rebuild the soap’s HQ in Elstree, Herts is costing licence fee payers a staggering poundmillion rather than the poundmillion originally planned. It will not be finished until . Mr Evans suggested EastEenders could have followed rival Emmerdale’s example. The ITV soap staged a plane crash two decades ago and revamped its set. “Obviously there’s the example of Emmerdale in the ‘s who flew a fictional aeroplane into... and they wiped out the cast and the set and rebuilt it,” said Mr Evans. “Would it be cheaper through a plot line to have something fall out of the sky fictionally and wipe out the EastEnders set and rebuild it as new ” Lord Hall said: “ I think we are now in WA territory ... but no is the answer.” Asking the peer what lessons the BBC had learned, the MP asked: “Apart from dropping a bomb on the set, what would you dferently ” Lord Hall said: “I think we have got the right team together but leadership is important.” He also blamed the discovery of asbestos for the spiralling cost.

Middletown nestles in the hills of Co Armagh on the border with Ireland’s Co Monaghan. Its name is apt, as it is caught in the middle of a history-defining stand-off between the UK and the EU. While Westminster and Brussels use the prospect of bringing back a hard Irish border as a bargaining chip, in Middleshyshyshytown, as in all communities either side of the -mile iding line, they despair at the posturing and dread the reality.Filling his petrol tank at the CFS garage, which sits over the road from the derelict remains of the old customs hut, retired teacher Roy Todd expressed his exasperation over Prime Minister Theresa May ’s U-turn on the Irish backstop. He said: “Throughout the Brexit campaign, Northern Ireland was completely ignored.“And with weeks to go, even though Brussels have said this border is the key issue, they’re just not listening. They’re just having their own little back-room meetings in la-la land. “The Tories’ only policy in Northern Ireland is appeasing the DUP. They don’t care about the border. And they don’t care that they’re playing with fire. “It’s madness.”   Staff in the garage’s Costcutter shop worry about their futures. Most of their trade comes from the South and they fear it could disappear, as long queues at the border put people off crossing it. It’s the same story at McNally’s off-licence in the centre of Middletown. Owner Adrian McNally has run the shop for  years and gets most of his custom from the South. He admits: “Let’s just say, a hard border would not be good for business. People wouldn’t put themselves through all that hassle again. These politicians need to get this sorted right away.” This is an overwhelmingly Remain area in a strongly Remain part of Britain, despite what the DUP have many believe.  Armagh voted % to % to stay in the EU, while Northern Ireland as a whole voted Remain by % to %. Surveys say support for staying in the EU has now risen to %. The main road sign that tells drivers they are entering Northern Ireland has been defaced so many times that it’s been taken down. In its place are placards put up by protestors, warning: “No Borders. No Barriers. Protest.” Only a few weeks ago Theresa May said that ripping up the Irish backstop would be “an entirely irresponsible thing to do”. Yet, in an attempt to stop her party from splitting, she just has. To some, it looks like the , lives lost in the Troubles don’t matter. During those dark decades, Co Armagh was seen as an IRA support stronghold, earning it the nickname Bandit Country. In Middletown, a British Army barracks was a huge visible presence and customs officials patrolled border crossings. After the  Good Friday Agreement the barracks were torn down, a housing estate put in its place and border crossings became seamless.   All that may be about to change. When a group calling themselves “the IRA” claimed responsibility for a bomb in Derry city two weeks ago, they refershyenced a hard Brexit in their statement. In response, Dublin’s Garda Special Branch are sending extra patrols to the border to combat an expected increase in dissident terror activity. A sense of wariness towards British reporters – which I had not experienced since the days when the only stories we came over here to cover were atrocities – is ing. Most people in Middletown don’t want to talk about the possibility of a upturn in terrorism but a pensioner, who just wanted to be known as Dermot, explained how a hard border could facilitate it. He said: “With a hard border, you have customs huts. Inside them, you have men in unorms that say to some people that they are agents of the British state. “Automatically, you have an easy target. Imagine the security needed to protect them  And who in their right minds would work there again ” Once again the Irish people are caught up in a British political quagmire that is not of their making. Dennis Brennan and his we Mary are from Monaghan town, on the Irish side of the border.  Dennis didn’t pull his punches. He said: “Bringing back a hard border would be a disaster. Pure disaster. We never want to see it again. “It’s been brilliant round here since the Good Friday Agreement. Peaceful. But you have to fearthe border s, so could the Troubles. “These politicians have to come to some agreement. There’s no doubt a hard border would be terrible for the Irish economy, but it could be even worse for the people. And surely nobody, but nobody, wants that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit major companies leaving uk","story":"NewsBrexit: All the major companies leaving the UK to avoid chaos as the clock ticks downThe British Chambers of Commerce has warned that the preparations by its members so far only represented the “tip of the iceberg”ShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsTheresa May on a visit to a factory\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor many months the idea that businesses might leave the UK because of Brexit was dismissed as project fear.

The Prime Minister met a wall of resistance from the EU’s top politicians who insisted the withdrawal agreement could not be unpicked. Senior figures in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin all warned that her demand increased the chances of no-deal Brexit as the clock ticks down towards March . Mrs May has admitted there is “little appetite” for reopening a deal in EU capitals, but has been instructed by MPs to try to strike a Plan B. She is desperately trying to hold together a fragile truce in the Tory ranks after a vote on Tuesday demanded the hated Irish backstop was replaced with “alternative arrangements”. So where do things go from here  Weve spoken to sources who are plotting the way forward.  The PM and her ministers will spend the next few days working out exactly what to take back to Brussels. Mrs May has already held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Irish PM Leo Varadker and EU chief Donald Tusk. She will now try to nail down the detail of her Plan B. Some Tory MPs thought the Brady amendment just meant a few tweaks on the Irish border backstop plan. But many Brexiteers only backed it on the understanding she would rip up the withdrawal agreement altogether. She will meet with some of those backbenchers on Thursday. As well as trying to hold together the Tory party’s fragile truce, the also needs to push key EU figures as far as they will go.  Mrs May is expected to jet out to Brussels early next week after, as one No  insider put it, “the howling stops and the dust settles”. Government insiders are not optimistic about their chances of persuading Brussels to reopen the orce deal after EU leaders lined up to say “Non. Nein. Nej.” But they’re keeping their fingers crossed that the EU might have one last big compromise up its sleeve. Even the PM admitted it would be a big ask. But in order to deliver on Parliament’s wishesshe has to at least try. She is looking at three areas for the backstop - technological solutions, a time limit and a unilateral exit clause - all of which she has said would be impossible in the past.  The Government has promised thatit gets a deal, MPs will get a second ‘meaningful vote’ on her revised Brexit plan as soon as possible. If, as expected, Brussels rejects her pleas and she comes home empty handed, they will be given a fresh chance to debate Brexit on February  with a vote the next day. This will give MPs the chance to re-run this week’s amendmentsthey wish - potentially handing back control of the Brexit process to Parliament, delaying the UK’s departure beyond March  or legally ruling out crashing out altogether. Mrs May promised another set of votes - which she hopes will not turn into a Valentines’ Day massacre - to stave off a Remainer rebellion on Tuesday. WHAT NOW FOR BREXIT   Unless Brussels puts a last minute offer on the table, which looks unlikely, Mrs May will be back at the despatch box in two weeks’ time. Her party will be more ided than ever. Tory Brexiteers and the DUP will be pushing her to the next stage of the ‘Malthouse compromise’ which would ultimately mean leaving the EU a year later and on damaging WTO terms. Her Remainer MPs who stuck by her this time will be in no mood for standing quietly by. They will push her towards a softer Brexit - working with Labour MPs to get a deal that Brussels would accept. After years of kicking decisions down the road, it will finally be decision day for the PM - continue to appease her hardline Brexiteers, or work across the Commons in the national interest, but risk splitting her party.

His Kne Crime Prevention Orders being unveiled today will have ious options such as limiting suspects’ use of social media in a bid to stop gang rivalries escalating. The Asbo-style powers could be used to target those as young as  who police think routinely carry a blade. But officers and campaigners question how the plans can work and say the Government should stop “meddling” so police can get on with the job of enforcing the current laws.  Barry Mizen, whose -year-old son Jimmy was murdered in  in South East London, said: “They are giving the impression new laws will solve the problem asyou can control everything through legislation. “We need more connected communities and support.” Ann Oakes-Odger, who runs charity KneCrime.Org after her son Westley Odger was stabbed to death aged  in Colchester, Essex, in , said: “I feel frustrated that we keep seeing the Home Office meddling with sentencing... “Courts can hand down a four-year jail sentence for someone carrying a kne. “We have to use existing punishments rather than keep bringing in new initiatives. We are not using what we have, why would this work any better ”  Patsy McKie, whose son Dorrie was murdered aged  in Manchester in , said: “Are they going to stop everybody of a certain age to make sure they are not carrying knives How is it going to be carried out on the streets  I don’t knowthey have stopped to think about this properly.” The measures could include banning contact with specic people online. They are civil orders but breaches would be a criminal offence that could result in two years in jail. Like with an Asbo – a court order meant to curb the actions of someone thought likely to cause harm or distress to others – police would apply for these new measures in the courts. They would last for a maximum of two years. The Home Office said the orders could include curfews and geographical restrictions, and force people to attend kne crime awareness courses. Mr Javid said: “I will do everything in my power to tackle the senseless violence that is claiming too many young lives.  “The police already have a range of measures to keep our streets safe, but there is more we can do to help them... “I have listened to their calls and will be introducing these new orders to stop gang members carrying knives in the first place.” Ministers have come under pressure amid a surge in fatal stabbings. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said: “The Tories’ approach of more laws without the police to enforce them is pointless politicking.” Ministers will seek to amend the Offensive Weapons Bill to introduce the new orders. But Police Federation chairman John Apter said: “The Government is tinkering around the edges...While I cannot fault Mr Javid’s intentions, I don’t hold out much hope these measures will have the dramatic impact... he’s hoping they will.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa mays brexit victory not","story":"NewsopinionTheresa Mays Brexit victory is not quite what you thinkSanity is beginning to reassert itself, in the place where dreams meet geographyShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  JAN Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Hooray and huzzah, hang out the bunting and issue high-fives all round. Something has finally happened on Brexit.What has happened is that the Tories have agreed to stop screaming up their own bumholes and scream at the EU instead. This will come as a relief to all those who witnessed their -month act of circular self-abuse, but they did at least give us a new definition for windbags.  This has been described as Theresa Mays best day at work since  by all those people who have not had enough fresh air recently. Her great success is that someone  has been able to unite the Tories around a version of Brexit that is impossible, impractical and undeliverable.They even managed to persuade  of the crazier members of the Labour Party to join them in this unmedicated dreamland, where the DUP have long gambolled in the insane belief it will reignite their holy war against the Fenians.The Tories have, for the first time in two and a half years, decided what they want. The problem is that it is the opposite of what Theresa has done or can do. On November , , she told the House of Commons: The Brexit talks are about acting in the national interest, and that means making what I believe to be the right choices, not the easy ones.I know there are some who have said I should simply rip up the UK’s commitment to a backstop, but this would have been an entirelyirresponsible course of action. It would have meant reneging on a promise made to the people of Northern Ireland during the referendum campaign and afterwards - that under no circumstances would Brexit lead to ato the borders of the past - and it would have made it impossible to deliver a withdrawal agreement.As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I have a responsibility to people in every part of our country, and I intend to honour that promise.And last night, she was told to do all the things she didnt want to do on the grounds that doing them would be f***ing disastrous. What has happened is this: . Theresa presented Plan A, which guaranteed the rights and safety of .m British citizens in Northern Ireland, and was punched in the face by Parliament which snarled stuff em.. Theresa presented Plan B, which was much the same but had a dferent letter on the front page, and Parliament said well maybe so long as we can decide to say stuff em later, slapped Theresa lightly and sent her back to Brussels. The EU are about to say alors, but you people cest tres thick. Theresas people are already briefing therell be a Plan C. And I can tell you now whats in it.  Plan C will have moved on signicantly from Plan B by being more like Plan A. Itll have the same words in much the same order, with very similar promises about protecting those .m British citizens with a backstop, and it will get voted through by Parliament for two reasons.First, theyve voted on it twice already, and have been dragged towards accepting a version of it. On the third time of asking, theyll be ready to back ANY version, in much the same way a man who has kicked himself in the head will wonderits possible to do it again.Imagine such a person, and you will have invented Iain Duncan Smith.  Secondly, there will be no other option.There is now no Parliamentary time left for Theresas deal to get the necessary legislation through before its self-imposed Article  deadline. There isnt even enough time for the new laws we need to trade under WTO rules in the event of a No Deal Brexit.By automatic operation of the law, on March  all EU treaties cease to be effective. Predicted results include motorways turning into lorry parks, medicines being rationed, the imposition of martial law and Jacob Rees-Mogg declaring an ancestral right to eat peasants. Even those Parliamentarians whove been hoarding gold and have a Barbudan bolthole dont want that sort of legacy hung around their neck, so extending the deadline is inevitable. And fortunately, the law they wrote about all this allows for a minister to change the exit date whenever they fancy. And most importantly there is no other option for the border in Northern Ireland. No way to take back control, no way to superimpose a UK referendum on to a people who had a referendum on this already, and managed a % mandate on an % turnout. People traffickers and drug smugglers dont fill in customs forms, weve no way to police a -mile border with  crossing points, and as the cherry on the cake elderly IRA bombers are coming out of retirement to make car bombs for new splinter groups.The only way all these things were resolved was with an open border, that allowed the unionists to remain British while allowing the republicans to pretend they were Irish.No-one has an alternative to that, and it is a fact of quite beautul irony that the only way anyones going to Brexit isthey refuse to take back control of our sole land border with the EU.So we wont Brexit on March , because we cant. Well call it Brexit a bit later, and it wont be because all this arguing was just to get us to the point where we could discuss what Brexit will look like. And it wont ever BE Brexit, because every power-crazed demand the backbench fruitloops have made has had to be dropped - when courts ruled it unlawful, when public opinion swung against them, and when Theresa persisted them into submission.Her problem is that all the Brexit chaos has been laid at her door. She has been blamed for the indecision, poor negotiation and infighting, for a dud election and international humiliation.Yet somehow, through either great stupidity or brilliant stratagem, she has forced her party and the country to agree what it never would have done in , a year or even  months ago. Leavers and Remainers now fervently believe any deal is better than none at all, appreciate Northern Irelands problems in a way few ever bothered to do, andthe polls are right are coming to the opinion that the current deal we have with the EU is the best of all possible worlds.What happened last night is that the hardliners have taken their latest of , tiny steps towards admitting their dream is just that. Thats why Theresa is stronger than ever, why the Labour Party is on the back foot and the EU is scratching its head.Sanity is beginning to reassert itself. It says do something, avert disaster, extract cranium from bum, ask yourselfthis is a good idea. All those Parliamentarians who complained Parliament was being undemocratic are now praising it for embodying the will of the people.Theres months and probably years more of arseing about, of course, and any group of people with a fetish for rectal screaming are probably going to try it a few times more before they realise it hurts too much.Sanity is not immediate. But it is there, flickering gently in the place where dreams meet geography.

The wrap, which costs pound. has been criticised for lacking rice, meat and fish as well as being served in a flat bread.Chef Maunika Gowardhanm, author of Indian Kitchen, shared a snap of the wrap on Twitter , saying: Thanks but I like my biryani with rice in a bowl not a wrap. Seriously MS! She added: Just to put it in perspective, in India firstly there is no such thing as a veg biryani. Most places will serve mutton or chicken or even fish. Its wrong on many levels when people will assume this is what a biryani looks like! Biryani needs rice, isnt stuffed in bread and doesnt include lettuce.   More than  people liked her tweet, with many taking the time to share their thoughts. One person replied: OMG a complete abomination and wrong on every single level. SO tired of all these brands and supermarkets plundering and murdering other people’s cuisines. Genuinely should be illegal. Another commented: Im on hold to the police. A third added: Eurgh! What were they thinking    Darjeeling Express, a Soho-based Indian restaurant, also shared their disgust about the wrap. They wrote: This is wrong at SO many levels - who are you paying to design your wraps @marksandspencer  You seriously need to rethink your exotic wrap selection. That is not biryani - you do not appropriate names from a cuisine without even bothering to do any research. However not everyone was opposed to trying the new MS offering.   A dferent Twitter user posted: I tried one, not bad but not enough spice. As a veggie its nice to find a sandwich I can buy when in a hurry.Meanwhile, Chef Vivek Singh, of Cinnamon Club, London, told The Times people accusing MS of cultural appropriation should loosen up.He continued: People in Britain love biryani as much as most of us from the sub-continent. Having cooked professionally for  years, I think a vegetarian biryani is just as authentic as anything . Responding to the backlash, a spokesperson for Marks  Spencer said: MS is famous for its food innovation and our developers use a fusion of dferent flavours and ingredients to create an exciting range of products to appeal to customers tastes.

Angela Davey, , was a married mum-of-two with a successful career before she got involved with a gang selling heroin and crack cocaine. It happened after her marriage hit trouble - and now her family have begged her to give herself up. Davey had been due to be sentenced for dealing cocaine after being caught during an undercover drugs operation. A close family member, who asked not to be named, said: Angela went from being a bright, well-educated person to somebody who the last time she was seen, was sleeping in a shop doorway in Norwich. Shes hopelessly addicted to drugs.  The relative said he feared the family would not get her back, adding: Her brain has changed. Everybody wants her to just come in so we can help her to deal with the situation. Davey had been due to appear at Norwich Crown Court along with David Teixeira, , from London, who was described as being the branch manager of the county lines gang, transporting drugs from the capital to London.

A study of , workers found more than half want their staff benefits to help improve their work le balance and  per cent want added extras which will save them money. And while younger adults highlight the need for help with housing, older generations are more concerned with private healthcare. Access to mental health care is also more important to those who started working this decade than to those who began their careers in any decade before.   It also emerged fewer than one in five are currently totally satisfied with the benefits package provided by their employer. And half of employees would leave their current employmentthey thought they could get a position where with more perks, with just  per cent preferring extra pay over comprehensive benefits. Steven Osei, spokesman for the Preferential Partnerships programme at Get Living, said: It’s no surprise that employees’ attitudes to workplace benefits have changed over the last five decades since the world we live in is almost unrecognisable now. “Employees are moving jobs more often, increasingly working from home and expecting to be compensated for their dedication. “To keep up with the competition, employers need to reflect workers more flexible lestyles.” The study also revealed employees who started their working le in  or later are most likely to want pets in the office, and free breakfast supplies. And the demand for company-expensed dental care has decreased over the decades, with nearly a quarter of older workers feeling it should be offered as standard by employers. This compares to just nine per cent of people who started their careers during this decade. Free tea and coffee is most valued by workers aged between -, with over-s the most likely to seek out an enhanced pension contribution.   People aged between - cite unlimited holiday days as the most attractive perk they think a company could offer. It also emerged employees who have been working the longest are most satisfied with their current benefits package, with those starting work in the s the least happy. Although more people who started work during this decade are currently looking for a job with better benefits than any other workers. But unusually, younger workers are also most likely to stay in their jobs because the benefits are too good to pass up.More than six in  workers who took part in the survey, conducted through OnePoll , believe their employer has a responsibility to look after their personal well-being.And workers agree they have become more demanding of their employers due to the hours spent at work, increased retirement age and the always-on nature of work making them feel their companies should offer more for their service. Get Living works with employers through its Preferential Partnerships programme to learn the challenges their people face living and commuting in the city where they work and offer a better way of renting.   Steven Osei added: “If a company wants to attract the top talent then they need to offer the best benefits, especially in London where the cost of living is leading to a brain drain. Since beginning the Preferential Partnerships programme, we’ve been working with top employers to create solutions for the challenges that their employees face when it comes to finding a place to live. “In this hyper-connected world an employer’s duty of care no longer ends at the office door. Well-being starts at home and we can support this by offering a simple move in process and quality, well-managed homes. “We know from speaking to our partners that this takes a weight off staff who are relocating or moving to a new city when starting a new job. We hope the success of this scheme will encourage more companies to take a vested interest in their employees’ living situations.” The most attractive workplace benefits - by age - .

Frank Field yesterday slammed the Topshop tycoon for trying to silence former staff who accused him of sexual, racist and bullying behaviour. Green, , vehemently denies the allegations. Earlier this week he announced plans to abandon a legal battle to maintain an injunction against a newspaper from publishing the claims.   But the Dailysaid it should only happenGreen agrees not to take subsequent action against his five accusers, who got payouts to settle their claims and signed non-disclosure agreements. Mr Field, the Commons’ Work and Pensions Committee chair, said: “The iniduals should be free to speak out, others should be freethey wish to. “These gagging orders are largely a rich man’s game.”The independent MP, who has clashed with the billionaire before, added: “He gave up on thebecause they have a lot of money but he is still threatening to pursue others.

He dismissed comparisshyshyons between claims about him and shamed film prodshyucer Harvey Weinstein.

Danial Elliott was beaten up as he walked home from school last Thursday. The youngster was hit from behind and kicked in the back and neck by his attackers who then fled the scene, Hull Live says.The schoolboy initially hid his injuries from his worried mum Vikki Elliott until they got back home. But the stress of his attack alongside being repeatedly bulled at school led to him later threaten serious self-harm. Ms Elliott, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, said: He looked fine when he got into the car. He said nothing to me which is not unusual and because of the bullying he will dust himself off as he is the eldest sibling.   We got into the house and he was stomping about I was asking what was wrong. He got into a bit of a confrontation with me before going into the hallway, putting his hands on his head and dragging his nails into his own face. He then shouted I might as well kill myself. The mum-to-four, , said Danial has been bullied since primary school, with children targeting him because of his bowel problems. She added: They call him things like smelly, a toilet, they call him all sorts. He doesn’t tell me anything now because he just gets fed up with repeating it.   It’s getting to the point where they are bullying him that badly that he doesn’t want to be around here anymore and before Christmas he threatened to hang himself. We are keeping an eye on him but there is nothing we can do to help him with this condition he has got. He is on medication andit stops working we have to up the dosage. He sees doctors and paediatricians but there is nothing  we can do until he is older. After the attack, Danial ended up in hospital until am on Friday, January , and he had to have his head put in a neck brace for extra protection. They could have killed him, Ms Elliott said. One kick in the wrong place could have broken his neck or paralysed him and the people who did this need to understand that.  You hear about it all the time – one punch in the wrong place and you can kill someone. They could have left me without my son and his three younger siblings without a brother and that is just devastating to think about. They were so worried on Thursday when he was in hospital and losing Danial would have left a big whole in our family.The incident has been reported to Humberside Police but it cannot be confirmed whether Danial was attacked by the same bullies who have been making his le hell at school.His mum continued: He is not ready to go back to school. He is so withdrawn and becomes even more withdrawn when school is mentioned. He is in a lot of pain and I want to doctors to write a note so that the school knows he needs time to recuperate.

Most of the expensive presents are given to her on dates with men, whose ages range from  to -years-old. But the mum from East London insists that she doesnt have sex with them.She told Sun Online about how she was inspired into escorting while she worked in an office on minimum wage.  She was talking to a friend about her money woes who encouraged her to pay it off by working as an escort. I wasn’t sure at first, but when my mate explained I’d get good money and wouldnt need to have sex with anybody, I went for it - I had no close family to help me out and I was desperate, she said. Michelle was advised to start advertising via a social media site called Faceparty. Here, she uploaded pictures and explained she was available for dates. Clients began to flood in from ious backgrounds - including one woman. She added: Clients don’t pay me for my time - but,they want to, they give me gt.

ITV carried out a survey of , people to determine which is Britains favourite breed, and the beloved Staffie was officially declared the top dog.The vast majority of Mirror readers reacting to the story on Facebook were pleased the breed is finally getting positive recognition, with many applauding the pups loyal, loving and soft nature that make them great family pets.Some Twitter users were keen to debunk the dogs bad rep in light of the news, posting adorable snaps of their dangerous and vicious pooches.   However, there was still some viewers expressing their dismay at the results, with several social media users describing the dogs as dangerous - but staffie lovers have quickly defended them. One wrote: Staffies are dangerous dogs. Who is even questioning this  Potentially dangerous to people and certainly to other animals, cats and dogs included.To which another Twitter user replied: I grew up with a staffie and she was the most loving and protective dog. If you bring them up to be dangerous, they will be. Idiot. Another wrote: Already seen a few morons calling them ugly chav dogs and vicious baby killers I honestly believe these muppets are in the minority and I hope our pooches will be given the credit theyre due. So why is it there still stigma associated with the breed  According to the Dogs Trust its partly down to the dogs fighting history which has tarnished the breed with the dangerous dog label, as well as their muscular appearance. A spokesperson for the charity told : There are lots of misconceptions and myths around theStaffordshire Bull Terrier, probablydue to their stocky and muscular appearance.However, it’s important to remember that there is greater iation in behavioural characteristics within breeds than between them - so we cant judge a dog by its appearance any more than a book by its cover.As with any breed of dog, the majority of Staffies are amazing, happy, friendly and fun members of the family - behaviouralproblems only arise where they dont have good early le socialisation, consistent interactions and positive training. The charity said it often sees a lot of Staffies at their centres due to over-breeding, or dogs being handed in by people who may not have realised how much care and attention they really need. Last year  Staffies and Staffie crosses were adopted across the Dogs Trusts network of rehoming centres. We see first-hand the positive dference these dogs make to their owners lives, sowe were delighted to see this breed crowned as the nations favourite, Dogs Trust added.We hope this boost for Staffies will encourage people to embrace the affectionate and loyal qualities that we know are so true of the breed.

The incident is believed to have taken place yesterday at Digbeth Coach Station in Birmingham, West Midlands. It has been claimed he was a taxi driver and the row was about a fare, but the Birmingham Mail report this has not been confirmed. The mobile phone footage begins by showing the two men aggressively shoving each other across the coach station – as security staff and bystanders try to break the fight up. However the young male manages to grab the burly older man - getting him into a chokehold and furiously pushing him. The cabbie is enraged by this and pulls his hood down to face his younger opponent. The senior citizen then furiously punches the boy and pummels him – until he is knocked out and sent flying across the station.   The young man is left shocked by his clearly capable older opponent’s moves and runs away from the fight. A security staff member intervenes and tries to pacy the old man. As the video ends, the taxi driver is seen walking out of the coach station.   It is unknown who filmed the original clip and why the fight erupted between the pair. However the footage has since gone viral across social media and has been edited with action music. Social media users have been thrilled with the senior’s citizen blistering knock-out. One user wrote “Go on uncle!” and another commented “Uncle going in like Popeye!” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum makes traumatising discovery hotel","story":"NewsMum makes traumatising discovery in hotel room with blood on the sheetsKali Powell from Austin, Texas, shared horrying pictures on social media from her recent hotel stay in San AntonioShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  JAN NewsKali was traumatised by the find \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum made a horrying discovery in her hotel room over the weekend, after discovering blood stains and some unwanted guests on the bed sheets.Kali Powell from Austin, Texas, wrote on Facebook that she was visiting the Drury Inn and Suites in San Antonio with her family when she made the unpleasant find.She wrote on the social media : Let me tell you about how we spent the last hour at the AMAZING bedbug infested Drury Inn  Suites in San Antonio!

Translating to mean “rich rice”, the dish’s main component consists of rice cooked in coconut milk, along with panda leaf and galangal root flavouring. A number of ingredients can then be added to the mixture. The most popular of which are usually crispy peanuts, anchovies, sliced cucumber and hard-boiled eggs.  Topped with samba hot sauce or tamarind juice, the rich rice is often served with fried chicken or beef rendang on the side. Its then served in a banana leaf - or bungkus - to keep it warm. Nasi lemak is regarded as being hugely signicant to the culture of the south-east Asian country. It’s thought to have been invented on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, intended the be a filling breakfast for farmers and labourers. But sold at roadside stalls and markets, the meal is so fervently popular it’s regularly eaten for lunch and dinner as well.  A famous legend says the recipe was discovered by accident when Seri, the daughter of a widow called Mak Kuntum, accidentally spilled coconut milk into a pot of rice she was cooking. “What did you cook ,” Mak allegedly asked. “Nasi le, Mak!,”responded Seri. Many iations of Nasi lemak have been developed over the years. It’s now garnered a cult appeal across India and China as well.

Delish – or is it Bakery chain Greggs attracted both praise and outrage when it announced it was introducing a vegan-friendly sausage roll.The snack is made with a “bespoke” Quorn filling and wrapped layers of pastry which are glazed with vegetable oil.With no meat at its core and no glaze of milk or egg, it couldn’t be further from the traditional idea of the sausage roll.But is it time we rethought the unpresuming tasty treat To solve the country’s most important conundrum – never mind Brexit – the Tele took to the streets to put Greggs’ latest creation to a blind taste test.Equipped with both meaty and vegan ieties, we gave locals one or the other and asked them to guess which they had just eaten.No points, no prizes – but we did give them free food.Stobswell retail worker Ali Fenton, , correctly guessed we had given her a vegan roll.She said: “It’s pretty good. I’m not really a big sausage roll fan but to be honest you wouldn’t be able to tell the vegan one is any dferent.“I can just tell they’re dferent because of the texture.“It’s nice for people who are either allergic or make the choice to have more options available – especially among the bigger companies.”Kat Marshall, , knew which one she had been given – as she had a vegan sausage roll in Glasgow last week.“To be honest, Greggs have nailed it,” she said.“I’m not a massive meat eater but I’m trying to be more mindful of what I eat. It’s nice to have the option.”In Dundee, there are all kinds of places where people can get their plant-based fix, from local businesses such as Marwick’s and Avery  Co to big chains such as Pizza Hut and Nando’s.Andthe experts have their way, we’ll all be eating less meat in future – and not necessarily for the sake of the animals.A report published by food researchers the EAT-Lancet Commission suggests meat-eaters need to cut consumption to the equivalent of half a rasher of bacon a day.If we don’t all adopt “planetary health” diets with less meat and more veg, it suggests the world could be irreversibly damaged due to the environmental impact of producing meat.It warned: “Without action, today’s children will inherit a planet that has been severely degraded and where much of the population will increasingly suffer from malnutrition and preventable disease.”Our other two tasters, Anis Makesh and Jamie Duggan, said they could easily make the switch for the sake of the planet.Jamie, , said: “I quite like a sausage roll and I would give the vegan one eight out of .“I can’t tell that this is a vegan one – I would probably say I could make the switch as long as things are the same price.”Anis, from the city centre, scored the veggie version seven out of .He said: “It’s very good. You can feel it’s a bit dferent but not all that much. If this sort of thing is widely available and it’s tasty, I could eat less meat.”So the humble sausage roll might be changing – but our test suggests it’s not all bad. And making small changes like this could help to preserve it – and the planet – for years to come."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c51a9fc0f9493.05612184.jpg ","title":"it must have been pretty serious man airlifted to ninewells after industrial accident in perth","story":"A man was airlted to hospital in Dundee with a suspected broken back and neck following an industrial accident.The incident happened at Glenalmond Business Park in Perth.The man was flown to Ninewells Hospital by air ambulance following the accident, which happened just after pm on Monday.The man, who has not been named, is understood to be .

draw with Kilmarnock.McInnes said: “As expected it was not as bad as the last time – when Scott got injured against Rangers, when he was out for six, seven weeks.“Scott will miss the next two or three games, but will hopefully be back for the cup tie.“The good news is it was nothing signicant and was just like a grade one tear.“He will hopefully be back before too long.”Aberdeen eased into the next round with goals from Niall McGinn, Sam Cosgrove, Greg Stewart and an own goal.It was Stewart’s first goal since ing to Pittodrie on a loan deal from Birmingham until the end of the season.Stewart spent last season on loan at Pittodrie, but spent the first half of this campaign at Kilmarnock.McInnes said: “It was a brilliant finish as he just got enough pace on the dink to get it over the line.”Aberdeen had been held - at Pittodrie in the initial tie having led -.In the aftermath of that draw McInnes admitted his side took their foot off the gas.This time the Reds were ruthless and there was never any chance of a repeat of Stenhousemuir’s famous - Scottish Cup defeat of the Dons in .McInnes said: “Our approach in the first game was absolutely spot on and we got the first goal.“We were just wasteful with chances and were maybe a bit rusty.“We were punished.“In the replay it was all about having that focus, calmness and using our experience.“We have been a good cup team over the last few years and I get reminded of the time Aberdeen lost at Stenhousemuir to Terry Christie’s team often enough.“It is easy to see why people maybe look at this as trickier.“But the players approached it right and we were clinical in the first half.“We spoke at half-time about making sure there was no sloppiness, so I was disappointed that we lost the goal.“To score from inside our six-yard box isn’t good enough and we need to make sure that was better.“But by and large there were some good performances and we stretched them and worked them.“We looked like a proper team and I am delighted we managed to score four goals and threatened to score more.”"},{"url":null,"title":"119000 children in need cash boost for charlie house","story":"An Aberdeen charity has been given a whopping £, in order to help children and babies with complex disabilities.Charlie House was awarded the six-figure sum, which will be paid out over three years, from the BBC’s Children In Need fund.Bosses at the charity said the incredible sum will “change the lives” of children across the north-east.Charlie House was founded in  and currently runs a number of services for youngsters with complex disabilities and or le-limiting conditions and their families.These include activity and siblings clubs, one-to-one support, annual adventure trips and a community nurse who works in hospitals.The funding will be used to provide therapeutic, supportive and fun activities for young people in order to allow siblings to better come to terms with their brother or sister’s le-limiting condition.It’s hoped that in turn will allow them to better manage their emotions, develop new friendships and experience a more positive home environment.Tracy Johnstone, chairwoman and founder of Charlie House, said: “We could not expand our reach to families and young people in the north-east of Scotland without the support of BBC Children In Need.

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months. All seven of Scotland’s cities are now covered by the deals and Ayrshire is in the first wave of regions. The poundm for Ayrshire takes total UK Government commitment to pound. billion across Scotland.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour .

I still have many of the books I bought with pocket money when I was young, carried through le like a lucky charm. TS Eliotrsquos Prufrock may have measured out his le with coffee spoons I have measured out mine with Puffins and King Penguins, Peregrines and Pelicans. If pressed, I could tell where I found each one.Like radio, the demise of the book has been often foretold. Books, we were unreliably informed, were yesterdayrsquos technology, so th century, so redundant in a digital age. I well recall the gleeful obituaries. The internet would sweep them away with tsunami-like ferocity. Kindles, apparently, were the future, and even I owned one once. Who knows where it lies unloved now. And who cares Similar prophesies of doom were made about bookshops, for what need was there for themno one wanted books  And for a while things did look a bit glum. With the demise of the Net Book Agreement, which determined that books must be sold at their cover price, many privately-owned bookshops found they couldnrsquot compete with the discounts offered by supermarkets and chain stores. Inevitably, sadly, some went to the wall or sold out to more voracious competitors.Of late, however, in what has been the bleakest of midwinters for the high street, there are signs that reports of the death of the bookshop were premature. In the last couple of weeks, I have heard of two new bookshops opening in Edinburgh. And last Saturday evening, I attended a mini book festival in Linlithgow, organised by the local independent, Far From the Madding Crowd, which was very well-attended, a testimony to the loyalty and warmth the shop engenders.The best bookshops are like that. When one of them is threatened it is a cause for mourning and resentment and the raising of petitions. For me, a town without a bookshop is unworthy of the name, a place where civilisation is yet to reach, where culture must surely fail to thrive. I have been in such outposts and nothing would drag me back.Where there is at least one bookshop there is hope. A year ago, I visited Christchurch in New Zealand, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating earthquakes of  and . The centre of the city was preternaturally quiet and the shopping mall was bereft of customers. But the one shop that was buzzing was Scorpio Books, also independently owned, which against all odds had managed to resurrect itself. Would the same, brave decision have been made by the fund managers who control chain stores  Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.One of the new Edinburgh shops will be Toppingrsquos, which has a wonderful branch in St Andrews. The companyrsquos founder is Robert Topping, formerly of Waterstonersquos in Manchester, which he left after being told to limit the size of the stock. The story is told in a new memoir by Glasgow-born Sir Tim Waterstone, of whom I was briefly an employee ndash the least said about which the better. ldquoThe Waterstonersquos model, recalls Sir Tim, ldquowas simply this: the highest class of heavily stocked literary bookselling run on a national scale by an unusually enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable young staff.Waterstonersquos was born in  when the book trade was in dire of need of modernisation. Complacent, rival shops kept short hours and unsatisfying stock, and their staff were more inclined to turn custom away than welcome it. Waterstonersquos ndash which was in the vanguard of Sunday opening ndash initiated a bookselling revolution and played an intrinsic role in making the literary novel cool. In the store in which I worked, on any given night you might catch a reading by Gore Vidal, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver or Edna OrsquoBrien. It was like a club of which anyone could become a member.Scratch any writer and they will regale you with tales of their favourite bookshops. I have one ndash Main Street Trading in St Boswells ndash a handful of miles from where I live in the Borders. Some prefer charity shops, others, such as my biblioholic husband, emporia like the Strand in New York with its eight miles of books.

A statement is expected this morning.The second demand is for a longer-term commitment to overhaul local taxation.The Greens want to replace council tax with a % annual property levy, and for councils to have far greater powers to raise their own taxes and set business rates.It is understood the government has agreed to discuss council tax reform, possibly through a cross-party forum, with a view to legislation by the end of this parliament.However it would probably for the next parliament to decide whether to pass any new law.In the short term, the government will also consider new local taxes such as a tourist tax.The financial and political demands come as a package - unless the Greens agree to the revised council funding, they will not get the tax reforms they have long campaigned for.Opposition parties said the Greens had always been likely to agree because of how it would look for Holyroodrsquos only pro-independence parties to fall out.Mr Mackay has also been under pressure to find a deal because the SNP has contrasted Holyrood stability with Brexit chaos at Westminster.A budget failure would also have undermined that message, as well as putting a dent in Mr Mackayrsquos leadership ambitions.Mr Harvie told the Herald: ldquoThe government has moved more than I thought they would this time last week. We are continuing to work hard in the final stages to reach an agreement that will protect local services.ldquoThe government know what they need to do. We will see where we get to.He also told ITV Border: ldquoWe are very hopeful that the Scottish government will give ground.

I urge all MSPs to unite behind the   Scottish Budget - that is what people theand breadth of Scotland expect.ldquoWe are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects, and I am confident others will approach things in the same spirit.Tory MSP Dean Lockhart said: ldquoRight across Scotland businesses are struggling to cope under an anti-business SNP government.ldquoDerek Mackay needs to stop the tax rises on people and firms, and set out pro-business plans to generate wealth, encourage investment and reward hard work.Labour urged all opposition parties to vote down the budget.If the Budget Bill is defeated today, the government would be able to table it again, with or without revisions, for another vote almost immediately.If there was a tie, the Presiding Officer would use his casting vote to continue the Bill.Final budget and income tax votes are due in mid-February."},{"url":null,"title":"rock-meets-gaelic-tradition-and-xbox-fantasy-in-celtic-connections-concert","story":"Yet on Thursday night, theyrsquoll take concert-goers into a world of fantasy, traditional music and live-action combat in a unique cross-over performance fusing traditional Scots music and Gaelic singing with interactive gaming.Simple Minds bass player Ged Grimes will lead a team of musicians and singers, including Deacon Blue guitarist Gregor Philp, in a one-off performance of the soundtrack from an American-made computer game set in th century Scotland.Players fight an evil force which has lain in wait for hundreds of years following mysterious events at Skara Brae, Orkneyrsquos famous neolithic settlement.The adventure is set against hours of Celtic music, scored exclusively for the game by Mr Grimes, working with a number of prominent musicians from Scotlandrsquos traditional scene.Mr Grimes, from Dundee, was approached by New Orleans-based game developers inXile Entertainment, having worked on soundtracks for games such as Earthworm Jim, Enter the Matrix and the Bourne Supremacy since the late s.Collaborating with musicians and singers from the Scots and Gaelic musical backgrounds, including -year old Peigi Barker, the voice of Young Merida in Disney film Brave, as well as -year-old Gaelic singer Rona Lightfoot, Mr Grimes was inspired by a visit to Japan to stage a live version of the music from the game featuring a full band and footage from the game.Tonight, his vision will be realised at Glasgowrsquos Royal Concert Hall as part of Celtic Connections.Mr Grimes said: ldquoYears ago I met Nobuo Uimatsu in Japan. He composes the music for the Final Fantasy games, and was one of the first to take an orchestra out to play the music from the games.ldquoThat really intrigued me, it made me realise there was an audience for this.The event, directed by Dundee Reprsquos Andrew Panton, will feature performances from singers including Kathleen MacInnes, Fiona Hunter, Eilidh Cormack, and narration from actor John Buick.Mr Grimes worked on the soundtrack across several years, between international tours of America, Mexico and Australia with Simple Minds.He said: ldquoIrsquom long enough in the tooth now to know that you have to keep yourself animated and active. One thing Simple Minds have done, which I have total respect for, is that theyrsquove never rested on their laurels.ldquoWe did an acoustic tour a few years ago which tied in well with what I did on the games.ldquoBut this has opened up a world of incredible young Gaelic singers and musicians who are confident, multi-talented iniduals with a real pride in their culture and they want their culture and their language to be relevant and used.ldquoThe idea of that community being represented in an Xbox game is great. If someone in South America is playing the game then theyrsquore going to be hearing these songs and Gaelic music. It authenticates the game and it also gives those songs an international audience, and people might want to find out more about those songs and that language.ldquoItrsquos a bold and ambitious project which has over  people involved, but I just think sometimes people are looking for new experiences, said the musician, who was also an original member of s pop band Danny Wilson, best known for the  hit Maryrsquos Prayer.ldquoItrsquos a great thing for Gaelic and traditional Scots music to be in an Xbox game.

Volume two of the soundtrack is released this week.Discussions have taken place about further performances, including a possible production at Dundeersquos VA.Mr Grimes said: ldquoThere might be chance to recreate the concert in another form with the possibility of a performance at the VA as part of a videos games exhibition.ldquoItrsquos a unique thing, not something that comes along every day.

Or maybe it just does not seem fair to have a fight in which thousands, including a Cabinet Minister , line up against one -year-old.Mr Greerrsquos  minutes began last week after the Conservative Party sent a tweet to mark the anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill, who died in  at the age of .ldquoFor many, the party noted, ldquothe greatest Briton to have ever lived. Mr Greer reckoned this deserved a response, as stated previously, and lo there poured forth upon his head much outrage, the stickiest of it coming from Mr Morgan, the host of ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain.The Scottish Parliamentrsquos youngest MSP went on GMB to defend his view. Rather brave of him, I thought. No sign of the Scottish cringe in this one. He acquitted himself well enough, with an answer for every point put to him.As Piers went into full Tasmanian Devil mode, Mr Greer, getting his retaliation in first, accused him of being a snowflake. Cheeky. When the MSP called a comment Mr Morgan made ldquowildly ahistorical, the host clearly did not know what the word meant.It was such a drubbing for Piers that his co-host Susanna Reid had to step in and save the interview, telling the MSP: ldquoNo one is denying that every historical hero should be scrutinised, but the use of the language is so offensive.Cometh the woman, cometh the point. While it is reasonable to appeal for some perspective on Churchillrsquos career, Mr Greer could have chosen his words, and his medium, more carefully.Just as children are told that there are outdoor voices and indoor ones, so there is language you might use in, say, a student union bar, or among friends. His Twitter summary was brutal, over the top, and yes, designed to provoke a response.Such is the way points are made on social media. Twitter is no place for reasoned debate. Twitter is where nuance goes to die. The fact that so many politicians, from Mr Greer to the US President, see it as a primary vehicle for communication with the public, is deeply worrying, and indicative of these populist times.So much for what he said. What should not be in doubt is his right to say it. Nothing he tweeted was against the law. As for Piers Morgan telling Mr Greer thatldquoit wasnrsquot for Winston Churchill you would be speaking German and goose-stepping your way to Holyrood, it is a rum do to praise Churchillrsquos part in the fight for freedom at the same time as condemning someone for exercising their right to free speech.Even the most cursory look at Churchillrsquos history, pre-Second World War in particular, would find him a knotty, dficult character with a long, sometimes chequered career. He was a product of his era, his class, his prejudices. This was well known to people at the time.By the s Churchill was considered a busted flush. Then along came another world war. People could appreciate his blood, toil, tears and sweat because they had provided no little measure of these things themselves.While they valued the role Churchill had played, perhaps even thought him a military genius, they were not above seeing him in the round. By wars end they did not regard him as the man to lead them into the future. Hence Labourrsquos landslide victory at the polls in . That voters re-elected him in  is simply proof that times change and opinions with them.The further away we have come from the Second World War the more perspective on Churchill has been lost. There has grown up an almost infantile desire to portray him as a saintly figure who should never be criticised. No serious historian has taken such a tack, but others have. Take the  film, Darkest Hour. Won two Oscars Gary Oldman, brilliant. Fine movie, right up to the scene where Churchill takes a ride on the Tube and is urged by men and women of all classes and colours to stand up to Hitler, to fight, fight, fight and never surrender.From there, the audience is led to believe it was a straight journey to Churchillrsquos ldquofight them on the beaches speech. What a great story. Except it never happened. The filmrsquos director, Joe Wright, said the scenes were ldquoa fictionalisation of an emotional truth, a way to show that Churchill could read the mood of the British people better than his peers.The trouble with history is not, as one character said in Alan Bennettrsquos The History Boys, that it is ldquoone ******* thing after another. That is a statement of fact. The problem with history comes when we accept only one version of an event or person, usually from the victors side, as the truth and nothing but the truth.History is a deeply political, and politicised, pursuit. How it is told,it is even told in the first place, says much about the times and where power lies.How is it the case, for example, that I spent all my school years in Scotland yet was never taught a thing about my own countryrsquos history The American Civil War. The Peterloo Massacre. The Russian Revolution. All of this, but not a word about the Clearances, the Act of Union, anything to do with Scottish history. Anyone would think there was a conspiracy at work. Perhaps Mr Greer, given how keen he is on history, might like to look into that.Read more: Piers Morgan clashes with Ross Greer"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-weather-coldest-night-of-2019-as-temperatures-dip-to-136c","story":"Loch Glascarnoch in the Highlandstook the top spot for chilly conditions and reached a low of -.C in the early hours of Thursday.The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for ice, snow and fog, which are set to remain in place throughout Thursday and Friday.#Cold this morning  Last night was the UKs and also all four of the home nations coldest night of the winter so far -. degC at Loch Glascarnoch was the lowest temperature recorded ### pic zycTcvjEZNorthern Ireland, Wales and Englandalso recorded their coldest night, withKatesbridge in Northern Ireland falling to minus .C, Sennybridge, Powys, dropping to minus .C, and Redesdale Camp, Northumberland, experiencing low temperatures of minus .C.The cold weather is not set to leave anytime soon - snow and ice is expected across much of Scotland on Thursday evening, with developing showers causingrain, sleet andsnowto fall on Friday morning.Read more:Scotland set for days of ice and snow as weather warnings issuedMotorists are warned to be cautious on the roads, as ice is likely to fall on untreated areas.The warning comes after a gritter overturned on Wednesday while on duty near Appin.The driver was taken to hospital after the vehicle crashed down an embankment at around .am."},{"url":null,"title":"bins to be collected once every three weeks in new council strategy","story":"Aberdeenshire residents will be encouraged to become recycling champions with the introduction of a controversial three-weekly collection programme.The revised waste strategy for all , properties in the Shire was approved in a - vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste bin.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..!

Sandy retired as a Sergeant in Bucksburn in .Speaking about the celebration Instructor PC Steve Warden said: “We are delighted to have Sandy back in the unit today to help us celebrate  years of the North East Dog Unit. Since founding the unit, there have been hundreds of dogs and handlers who have all worked hard to help keep people safe here in the North East. We are a very special unit and we assist operational colleagues on all manner of calls from locating missing people, searching for items such as weapons, evidence and drugs and helping control volatile or aggressive situations. “Despite the many changes in policing in the North East over the last  years, it is great that the dog unit has remained and developed. We have a very strong team with a mix of experience but with the same dedication to the unit and the job. We hope that the North East Dog Unit enjoys many more decades of work.” As part of the celebration, Mr Reid has donated Rennie’s original collar and dog tag which is engraved stating that Rennie was owned by the Chief Constable of Aberdeen City Police and has been framed as a lasting memento.Retired officer, Sandy Reid added: “I have kept in touch with the Unit since I retired more than  years ago and it was great to celebrate this milestone with them today. The current dog handlers face much of the same challenges I did.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years. They are supervised by qualied supervisors and leguards.The majority of income is from its charity shop In Tulloch Street and the fees which are kept affordable for those on benefits, pensions and low incomes although these have increased by  per cent.Supporters are rallying to support the appeal and staff plan a -mile sponsored walk from Tain to Dingwall.To donate, see www.puffinpool or pop in to the pool or shop.Thursday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Help, I feel like a pair of curtains! – Pull yourself together then!” also featuring in the top ten.Meanwhile, the poll by Dundee-based magazine The Beano found that whilst fathers are notorious for their cringeworthy “dad jokes”, almost half of British children chose their dad as the funniest person in their family, while it was claimed that mums are generally found to tell the worst jokes.Two-thirds of kids polled said they usually hear the best jokes in the classroom and playground, while nine in ten British children insist that kids are far funnier than adults.Stand-up comedian Jay Lafferty, who organises the Comedy Kids events with the Edinburgh Youth Theatre at Edinburgh’s The Stand comedy venue, said: “Kids absolutely love word play and also anything to do with toilets or bottoms – they think it’s hilarious. “The joke that has come top here combines those two things – the pun on the ‘sea weed’ and also the toilet humour. I think being able to say things which would normally be a no-no, which people would normally stop them from saying, really appeals to them.“Having said that, I do stand-up with adults too and having heard a lot of grown-up comedians, I think especially for boys, the love of puerile toilet humour never really goes away.”She added: “Children are great to work with as they have no filter about what is funny. They also like any joke that has a really strong mental image that goes with it, almost like a cartoon that they can pull up in their heads.”Other jokes which made it into the top ten included “What’s the fastest vegetable  A runner bean!” and pre-school classic “What’s brown and sticky  A stick!”.Meanwhile, “What do you call a blind deer  No eye deer!” and “Why should you be careful when it’s raining cats and dogs  You might step in a poodle!” also ranked highly.The poll was commissioned to celebrate the launch of Beano’s new national joke competition to find the funniest school class in Britain.Mike Stirling, editorial director at The Beano, said: “Beano is encouraging pupils up and down the country to put forward their very best jokes, gags and funnies to be in with a chance of being crowned Britain’s funniest class. “Beano has always known how naturally funny kids are, so this national competition is the perfect way to shine a spotlight on the comedians of tomorrow.”The top three classes, voted for by the Beano’s gag-maker experts and kids themselves online at Beano will \u2028each win a bundle of Beano annuals, comic subscriptions and a special VIP Beano \u2028visit and joke workshop where one will ultimately be crowned Britain’s funniest class.Beano’s national school joke competition is open for entries from  April and closes on  May.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865210.1548919873!/image/image.jpg","title":"key snp figures told by nicola sturgeon to prepare for possible election","story":"SNP parliamentarians have been told by Nicola Sturgeon to prepare for a possible Scottish electionthe government at Holyrood fails to pass its budget today.The Scottish Government heads into today’s vote without a deal to secure a majority, risking defeat on its spending plans for the coming year.During a meeting of the SNP group at Westminster attended by the First Minister on Monday, Ms Sturgeon warned her MPs that they should prepare for a possible Scottish election campaignthe government fails to get its budget through, The Scotsman understands.However the move comes amid speculation that Ms Sturgeon may need a fresh mandate from the electorate to secure another referendum on independence, as she prepares to reveal her plans on the issue. Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations. To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

The Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Studyfor short, has discovered that nose drops and gargling with salt water can shorten the averageof a cold virus by almost two days. The research project run by the University of Edinburgh initially showed last September that NaCLinhibited all types of viruses. The prevention of viruses is caused by the chloride component of salt, not the sodium. Now the latest findings show that nasal irrigation and gargling with salt water will also help relieve the misery of the common cold. Patients were asked to keep track of symptoms by collecting a nose swab on five consecutive days, and to treat the illness by snfing hypertonic saline nasal irrigation drops that has a higher concentration of salt and gargling. The participants in the study displayed a reduction in the overallof the illness of . days, as well as a  per cent drop in over-the-counter medicine use and a  per cent reduction in infection of others in the household. Dr Sandeep Ramalingam, consult­ant virologist at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, who led the study, said cells use chloride ions to produce hypochlorous acidwhich is the active ingredient that is found in bleach.In effect, cells use the chloride ion to produce bleach to get rid of viral infections – since bleach kills all viruses Dr Ramalingam believes that this will work across the board.He added: “Jala Netihas been recorded in ancient texts that are thousands of years old. “I understand that gargling with salt water was commonly recommended by GPs in the UK, up until the First World War.“It probably became an “old wives tale” after antibiotics were invented.“With ELVIS, we are in a way re-inventing the wheel by proving that salt water helps reduce the duration of the cold. “However, we have also done laboratory-based research where we have proved that our cells need the chloride ion from salt to stop viruses from multiplying. “Since this mechanism works against all types of viruses, it is an effective remedy for the common cold.”Based on the success of this study, its authors are launching another to focus on children. ELVIS Kids, hopes to recruit  children to take part.Scientists based at Edinburgh Children’s Hospital will teach parents how to make salt water and apply nose drops for their children at home. Parents will need to meet a trial nurse only once to take part in the study, and their child does not need to attend the meeting.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PLOCKTON-PANTO-19-9.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Our hard-won peace process and its political architecture have too often been taken for granted.We may have peace, but we have not seen enough progress.When over  Irish citizens from the north signed an open letter to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in December  it came at the end of a tumultuous and politically defining year.That January the Good Friday Agreement political institutions collapsed amidst the political and financial scandal of RHI.It served to confirm the growing view of northern nationalists that political unionism was not committed to proper power-sharing through the denial and refusal of equality, rights and respect towards the section of the community to which we belong, rights such as: access to justice marriage equality: language rights.It would seem that there can be no regulatory alignment on this island, and Bangor must be as British as Finchley, unless you are gay and want to be married or seek to live a le through the medium of Irish with statutory protection.This contempt mobilised the nationalist and republican electorate: in turn the unionist political majority in the Assembly was ended.Increased unionist belligerence continued, and then, the nationalist constituency sent a stark message during the subsequent Westminster election, that it was turning its back on Westminster.However, the political process in the north had already been seriously destabilised due to the result of the EU Referendum in , when a majority of people in the north voted to remain in the EU.The British government ignored that democratic result and the emerging negative implications of Brexit became major talking points across the island.Every report and expert assured us that there will never be a hard border in Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement was constitutionally sacrosanct as an internationally binding agreement. Yet, within the past week, we have been told by Theresa May that the Good Friday Agreement is up for negotiation and the European Commission have confirmed that a no-deal Brexit will bring a hard border in Ireland and yesterday Leo Vardakar advised the World Economic Forum that there may be soldiers on the border.This culmination of events and concerns motivated me and others to make the first direct public appeal in late  to Leo Varadkar to stand up and speak out in defence of Irish citizens# rights in the north.We felt it was essential that Irish citizens in the north heard reassurance from the Irish Government that the reality of abandonment experienced by our parents and grandparents would not be visited upon our generation.The back page of your programme today carries an assurance from the Taoiseach that: “To the nationalist people in Northern Ireland, I want to assure you that we have protected your interests throughout these negotiations. Your birth right as Irish citizens, and therefore as EU citizens, will be protected.There will be no hard border on our island. You will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.”This assurance cannot simply be a historical quote.It must be a living commitment.It must mean that there can be no hard border on our island.That my children will not have to endure the ignominy of being stopped at Newry or Derry, when travelling to Croke Park for a match, or to Donegal for a holiday.One of the objectives of this conference today is to assert to the Irish Government that we are their citizens, bearing their passport and that we insist on our full access to citizenship, but rights, human rights are for all.No citizen in the north should endure a diminished sense of their citizenship as a result of Brexit. Everyone benefits when rights are protected, and all traditions and communities are respected and valued.Today’s conversation is about all of that. We seek to provide a space for a discussion to begin.It has to begin somewhere. And when we are told that now is not the right time, I ask then when is the right time. So,not now, when Nelson Mandela once observed that, “If you wait for textbook conditions they will never occur.”We believe this is the right time to have a conversation about the future.

Written by Patricia Gormley and directed by Alan McKee, the play begins to a backdrop of Abba’s Money, Money, Money, as final demand letters are piling up at the business but Olive is keen to keep on trucking and put on a brave face for her staff and loyal customers. Christina Nelson plays a total of four characters in the production including enthusiastic but scatty trainee Jolene, nearby fold resident and ‘the road’ gossip Granny Eileen, Mrs Hughes with notions above her station and Cryin’ Air stewardess Cha Marie who has an imminent wedding to plan.

Within minutes of the vote SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the Conservatives had #effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement#.DUP deuty leader Nigel Dodds reacted angrily to that claim, saying it was “utterly reckless to talk in those terms”.MPs earlier voted voted  to  in favour of rejecting a ‘No Deal’ Brexit.The vote outcome was met by a firm stance from EU leaders who insisted the Withdrawal Agreement would not be renegotiated. Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the backstop was “necessary” and “the developments at Westminster do nothing to change this”.European Council President Donald Tusk reaffirmed the EU position, adding: #The Withdrawal Agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreementis not open for re-negotiation.#The vote has received widespread reaction from local politiicans. Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard has said the British parliament needs to realise that it cannot push the people of Ireland around over Brexit.  “What is happening at Westminster is clearly not in the interests of Ireland,” he said.“Instead it is all about the right-wing Brextremists of the Tory party who have been allowed to set the agenda. “In its desperation, the British government is trying to threaten and intimidate the Irish people with a hard border and an economic clf edge. “They need to realise the days of the British government and British parliament threatening the people of Ireland and pushing them around are over and not coming back. “The Irish government and EU need to stand firm against attempts to sabotage what has already been agreed.#SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the British government#s decision to #allow the dissolution of the Irish backstop# over the heads of people in Northern Ireland.He said: #Tonight, London decided that the interests of the people in Northern Ireland were secondary to the needs of the Conservative Party. The rejection of the Irish backstop, the only viable mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is an affront to the Good Friday Agreement.#Let me be clear, the people of Northern Ireland did not consent to this. We will continue to engage with the Irish government to ensure that the backstop, as reiterated by Brussels, will not be undermined in the slightest.#Alliance Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry MLA said Parliament has voted to send Brexit down “a dead-end” on the backstop.“Many people will be exasperated at a dysal Parliament unable to process and work through the real choices facing the UK around Brexit. Thirty-one months on from the referendum there is still no coherent way forward,” he added.“Those opposed to a no deal and alternative softer versions of Brexit are struggling to uny around an effective pathway. While there may be a majority for the principle of a no deal, there is no agreed means to stop it. By contrast, the Prime Minister has conducted a shameful u-turn on the backstop, and abandoned the deal she made with the EU only a few weeks ago.“Throughout the Brexit process, the Prime Minister and UK government have been clear they would avoid a hard border in Ireland at all costs. The need for the backstop only arises from the UK#s decision to leave the EU and the mutually incompatible red lines. At no stage has the UK government produced any viable alternative. And crucially, the Prime Minister did sign up to the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement and defend its necessity. This abandonment of the backstop is an enormous act of bad faith and sends a terrible message to the people of Northern Ireland.“However, this is a pointless victory for the government. The EU is rightly clear the backstop and the Withdrawal Agreement are not up for renegotiation, and have indicated as such once again today. So this represents a dead-end. This amendment is therefore the ultimate unicorn, only serving to waste time and increase the risk of a catastrophic no deal crash-out.“There are consequences to constant delay and failure to face reality, as businesses and others cannot wait for certainty, and may choose to take proactive decisions which impact on investment and jobs.#"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37768497.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/POLITICS791.jpg","title":"blockchain technology could be the solution for border trade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Initially created as the infrastructure for decentralised cryptocurrencies, it is effectively a digital list of records or transactions that are linked together in a public database. Advocates of blockchain have long argued it could work by monitoring goods moving across the border in a non-disruptive way that would not breach the Good Friday Agreement. Blockchain would do this by digitally recording goods transparently and would be updated by those using it. Andrew Bird, chief executive of digital transformation firm GS Marketplace, said: \"In our opinion, the Northern Ireland border issue is a non-issueyou use technology. The whole thing just ceases to be a problem. \"But someone needs to define what you want the border to look like - is it checking everything  I doubt it - thats against the Good Friday Agreement. \"If its maintaining the current level of rigour, which I would assume is going to be acceptable, then absolutely blockchain could do this relatively quickly.\" Mr Bird said scanning devices could be used, saving drivers from needing to get out of their truck. Critics of blockchain have described it as a \"wild card\" because they believe no one really understands it. \"If there are wonderful technologies that make borders near frictionless, why arent they being used where - or where are they being used \" asked Professor Vili Lehdonvirta, associate professor at the University of Oxfords Internet Institute.\"If were talking about a world-first, especially at some kind of an accelerated, break-neck speed, the chances of failure seem very high, considering the track record of the UK government in large IT projects.\" Another alternative being discussed is the Malthouse compromise, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party. It refers to a \"protocol\" replacing the backstop.This offers ious technological and procedural measures - including customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU - which would supposedly eliminate new frictions on the border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But Dr Katy Hayward, of Queens University, Belfast, said its provisions for policing and preventing smuggling would not be secure. \" self-assessment and periodic declarations simply do not provide data that is substantive enough for managing movement of goods between dferent customs and regulatory regimes,\" she said.\"Secondly, computerised risk analysis without the means of intervention is pointless.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup accuses eu of intransigence over refusal to renegotiate deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

National leaders across Europe are beginning to realise that the single-track focus on the backstop may in fact lead to the very outcome it set out to avoid.\"To insist on a proposal which is not deliverable in the UK shows intransigence.\"We say calmly and clearly to the EU leadership that we do not need the backstop. It is now time for a sensible and pragmatic renegotiation.\"DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds urged the Irish government to \"tone down the rhetoric\" and work towards a \"sensible deal\" that avoided a hard border.He described some of Dublins comments as \"reckless\" and said while the withdrawal agreement was not acceptable to unionists, with \"renewed focus\" a consensus which worked for everyone was possible.But Sinn Fein urged the EU not to budge over the backstop.The party held several meetings on Brexit at Westminster yesterday.Francie Molloy MP said: \"We met today with the British Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to discuss the ongoing Brexit crisis in the British parliament and reiterated our position that the backstop is not open for renegotiation.\"We also met with the British Labour partys Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, to convey the same message. At both engagements we made it absolutely clear that the British Parliament cannot tear up or alter the Irish backstop.\"Ulster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said the backstop was incompatible with the principle of consent. He also challenged the claim by SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford that Mrs May had ripped up the Good Friday Agreement.\"The UUP will take no lessons from anyone when it comes to the Belfast Agreement,\" Mr Aiken said. \"We negotiated it, so we are well placed to know what it says.\"Of key importance to unionism was the principle of consent being enshrined. That means there can be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the express consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland.\"But SDLP MLA Sinead Bradley praised the SNP politician.\"The DUP ignored the voices of people here once again, so much so it took an SNP MP to remind the those on the benches of Westminster of the reality of their decision,\" she said.\"It is equally as frustrating that Sinn Fein, who have no dficulty turning up for media interviews, refused to use their mandate where and when it counted.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said: \"The EU can parrot as often as it likes that the deal is done, but the legal reality is very dferent: there is no deal until it is ratied and the UK has rightly refused ratication.\"If, therefore, the EU persists in refusing further negotiations, then, it will be the EU that guarantees no deal. Their choice.\"The job of Brexiteers in Parliament and where, in the name of .m people, is now to ensure the Government at last holds the line and calls the EUs bluff.\"Mrs May will be judged by delivery on her pledge of real change to the legal text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement.\"If the EU chooses no deal, then so be it.\"The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: \"The EU had said it was seeking clarity - there had been suggestions that the backstop was not the main issue of concern, which had originated in Brussels.\"I think a clear message was given by the House of Commons that the backstop is the concern which MPs have, and thatwe can find a way to address those concerns, there is a stable majority for getting support for the deal in Parliament.\"Mrs May yesterday met privately with Jeremy Corbyn to discuss the way ahead.A Labour spokesman said it was \"a useful exchange of views\", the tone of the talks was \"serious and engaged\", and the pair had agreed to meet again."},{"url":null,"title":"benefits blunder leaves northern ireland woman destitute","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But when her former employer paid her wages into her bank account a day late, Orlagh claimed she couldnt access the £ December payment she was legally entitled to.Two months on - and currently thousands of pounds in debt - the -year-old from Dunmurry still hasnt received a penny and revealed that shes getting more and more desperate.\"Im living on money borrowed from my mother and my friends,\" she said. \"Its very stressful. Im trapped in this world now.\" Despite no longer being able to afford to eat or heat her home, Orlagh said shes been desperately trying to get other reception work, although the odds are stacked against her.\"Ive been sitting for days on end with no gas and empty cupboards,\" she said. \"Ive been for interviews but my confidence and self-esteem are gone. In my job, grooming and presentation are important youre expected to have your nails painted, your make-up on and no grey roots showing.\"I have no money to get my hair done. Im having trouble with a tooth, but I cant afford to see a dentist. Who is going to employ a toothless receptionist with grey roots \" She added: \"I havent kept my spirits up. Ive turned off people on social media to avoid upsetting myself over what theyre doing and what theyve got.\"The Department for Communities said that while it cannot comment on inidual cases, it is \"looking into the concerns raised in this case\".Orlagh said her money problems first began on August , , when her working tax credits stopped after her son Oisin turned  and left full-time education.\"That basically plunged me into financial chaos,\" she said.\"I was on a -hour contract at my previous job and when I asked my employer for at least  hours they couldnt offer me anything extra, so I had to leave.\"I was frantic. I was in real financial trouble so in a blind panic of desperation I left a job I really loved for another offering more hours.\"Prior to switching employers, Orlagh, whose only luxury is her television, said she really tried to make ends meet.\"From August  until October I lived on a part-time wagewith no benefit help and it wasnt enough - I was hungry,\" she said. \"Thats why I took a job offering more hours. But, after a one-month trial period, it didnt work out.\"With a monthly rent bill of £, and a weekly spend of £ on electricity and £ on gasand £ on work transport, Orlagh found that it all soon adds up.\"I dont have a mobile phone or extravagant expenses. I dont go on holiday,\" she said.The new job lasted from October  until November . When she phoned to claim Universal Credit the next day, she was initially told to register online.But she couldnt register online because she didnt have the right technology. Therefore, she physically had to visit the job centre and was told to expect a five-week wait for payment.\"I hadnt been paid since October, when I left the previous job, so by that stage I was in minus figures,\" she said.\"I was supposed to receive £ on January  for the month of December - and that includes my rent - but I didnt get anything because my last employer paid me a day late, on November .\"I have repeatedly explained that the wages paid into my account on November  represent earnings from October  to November , .\"But they refuse to accept this. According to their computer, those wages were earned between November  and December , . \"Therefore nothing can be done to help me.\"Orlagh raised a complaint on January . But, three weeks later, there is still no news and she is yet to receive a payment. Meanwhile, she revealed that her financial situation is likely to get even worse as she struggles to repay two government loans.\"There was no Universal Credit payment in December and goodness knows when Ill get something,\" she said.\"I wouldnt have a penny to my nameI hadnt borrowed around £ from the Social Fund to see me through. \"But because Im also paying back another Social Fund loan from a previous time, it means that £ a week will be taken out of my £ Universal Credit benefit when I finally get it.\"Orlagh said she was speaking out today to reduce the stigma of being poor because \"there are so many people out there who are pretending that everything is OK when its not\".She added: \"One catastrophic event after another has led me to this position.\"Im not a tracksuit-wearing person out on the streets whos never worked a day in her le. Once youre on minimum wage youre screwed youre nothing.\" The Department for Communities said statistics are not available to confirm how many local families rely on Universal Credit.In a statement it added: \"Current figures at January ,  show , live claims in respect of , claimants.\"The department also said there have only been  complaints since Universal Credit was introduced here in September .What the Department for Communities says... “Universal Credit is assessed on a monthly basis and is based on the claimant’s circumstances and earnings. All claimants are offered an Advance Paymentthey feel they will need financial support during the wait for the first payment, which can be up to % of the estimated entitlement.“DFC has also put in place a Universal Credit Contingency Fund, available to customers who require further financial assistance before receiving their Universal Credit. Unlike advance payments, the Universal Credit Contingency Fund payments are non-repayable grants. Loans or grants are also available through the Discretionary Support Service which is unique to Northern Ireland and helps customers who require short term assistance in crisis or emergency situations.“The Department has been working closely with the Independent Advice sector to prepare customers for the introduction of Welfare Reform and has provided funding in the region of £m to the advice sector to provide support for claimants impacted by Welfare Reform.” "},{"url":null,"title":"facebook sued by dissident group saoradh over removed pages","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

This is not just about Britains future. This is about how we work together in the future.\"He added: \"People keep talking about games of chicken and the UK position being against the Irish or the EU position. We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland.

PSNI has carried out a ‘large number of violent and destructive house raids’ which have also affected ‘vulnerable people’ and those arrested who had ‘no evidence put to them’.Sinn Féin Councillor and former Mayor, Maoliosa McHugh, said it was a matter for the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, to raise these matters and ensure there is an acceptable level of policing in the community.  He and his party members could accept the motion, he explained, but said they were totally opposed to police violence towards members of the community as ‘that type of reaction by the state gave rise to violence in this country’.Cllr McHugh said he would agree with additional resourcesrequired but added that there are ‘many areas’ which require extra funding at present.Alderman Drew Thompson, DUP, told the meeting he had met with the Chief Constable since the Bishop Street bomb and would ‘certainly support’ this motion.After further discussion Cllr Hussey’s motion was carried, thirty-three councillors voted in favour but all Independent councillors voted against or abstained."},{"url":null,"title":"grit delivered residents grangemore keep roads open","story":"Bags of grit salt have been

expansion","story":"Ulster University has confirmed the purchase of Foyle College lands in Derry which will allow for future development of the Magee campus.It was expected that Ulster University would buy lands at the Duncreggan Road site when Foyle College relocated to its £.m Limavady Road site last year, however, the deal has experienced delays.The local community and politicians are optimistic that this will pave the way for long-awaited expansion at the Magee Campus which has seen a drop in student numbers and courses cut in recent years rather than growth.In a statement to the Derry News at the weekend an Ulster University spokesperson confirmed that the deal included both the lands on the Duncreggan Road and playing fields opposite the old Foyle College junior school on the Northland Road.She added: “Ulster University has completed its purchase of the Foyle College lands, marking a milestone in the development and expansion opportunities for Magee campus.“The purchase follows the opening last year of the £m state-of-the-art teaching centre at the heart of the Magee campus, which has already enhanced the vibrancy of campus le and paved the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.“Options for the Foyle College lands will now be explored in line with the University’s plans for growth of the Magee campus and its wider estates strategy.”Sinn Féin MP Elisha McCallion has welcomed the acquisition of additional land and says it is part of a wider growth plan.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

university.  This land will be allow for the continued expansion of Magee.\"The key stakeholders involved have been working on the acquisition of this land for some time and I welcome the fact that it has now been completed.\"I will also be convening a meeting of all parties to meet with the permanent secretary of the Department of Health to discuss the plans for the establishment of a medical school at Magee.\"This is part of the wider plans for the growth and expansion of Magee which will provide more opportunities for young people and assist the development of a new, vibrant economy in the north west.\"Meanwhile, SDLP Councillor Sinead McLaughlin commented: \"This is a very important milestone as it reaffirms Ulster University’s commitment to the further expansion of the Magee Campus. The growth and development of the higher education provision within the North West region remains a political priority for our party as the university is a key driver for growing a vibrant regional economy.\"A key component of the University Growth Plan is the establishment of a Postgraduate Medical School. SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood, has expressed his commitment to join a cross-party group to meet with the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health to ensure that the Medical School gets approval

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

From its founder Ian Paisley being pictured with a sledgehammer and the slogan ‘smash Sinn Féin’ to deputy leader Peter Robinson leading an ‘invasion’ of the border town of Clontibret in the s to Ian Paisley Jr repeatedly shouting “moo, moo, moo” as a member of the Women’s Coalition spoke in the s, the DUP has always been far less concerned about the niceties of politics than most of its rivals.That willingness to act beyond the normal constraints of political discourse has been one of the secrets of the DUP’s ability to extract signicant concessions during negotiations - most obviously in  when the party secured a minimum of £ billion in new money for Northern Ireland in order to prop up Theresa May’s government.Even when in a weak position, the party believes that attack is the best form of defence.Over the last year there has been open DUP frustration – reaching a crescendo in December – at what it saw as Mrs May’s far less robust style of negotiation.But that simmering discontent has come to the fore over the last week as the DUP saw what it viewed as an open goal from the EU side.Last week – in what was the most dficult week for the otherwise watertight Dublin-Brussels relationship since the talks began – the European Commission’s chief spokesman said that in the event of a no deal Brexit it is “pretty obvious you will have a hard border” in Ireland.Dublin dismissed that argument, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stating that “even in a no deal, there will not be ato a border”.The very obvious question from the DUP was: If a hard border is not going to happen under any scenario – even a no-deal Brexit – why is the EU unprepared to move on the backstop, when it is supposedly there as an ‘insurance policy’ to prevent a hard border When asked that question, Tanaiste Simon Coveney has been evasive, something which will have heightened the DUP belief that it is a point of vulnerability for Dublin and Brussels.Last week also saw Michel Barnier state that “even in the absence of an agreement, we will do our utmost not to create a hard border in Ireland”, while the Polish foreign minister suggested that the backstop could be time-limited to five years, a proposal which is anathema to Dublin.The shambolic state of the British negotiation has to some extent obscured these problems for Ireland.Belfast murder victim’s family need answers, vigil told Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"On Tuesday, Sammy Wilson was quite open about the party’s desire, stating that “now is the time for the Prime Minister to exploit the chaos in Brussels and Dublin and press for a better deal”.Signicantly, that statement was endorsed by the party and released through its central press office rather than as a solo run by Mr Wilson.However, the DUP faces two dficulties of its own. While it is influential, the party is not in charge of the British side of the negotiations and the prime minister has done little to suggest that she has the appetite or aptitude for the DUP’s methods.And the UK is also facing a formidable negotiating partner, the EU, which is so far sticking to the sort of hard-nosed tactics followed by the DUP.try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

Three of the iniduals were from a cemetery in Dublin, while the others came from Co Kildare and Co Antrim.Genetic investigations, also known as genotyping, were carried out on the leprosy strains in two of the Dublin iniduals. The strains, which were dated from the early th century through to the th century, revealed that the iniduals had been affected by two dferent strains of leprosy. One had probable origins in Scandinavia, while the other first developed in the Middle East.The two strains are similar to those found in medieval Scandinavia.The scientists also examined the chemical composition of the teeth in the Dublin skeletons and found that two of the iniduals had come from somewhere colder, with older geology, than in Ireland – a good match for a Scandinavian origin.Professor Eileen Murphy, from the School of Natural and Built Environment at Queen’s, said: “Ireland is of particular interest in the history of leprosy as it was never part of the Roman world nor underwent any signicant occupation by later Anglo-Saxon settlers.”Professor Murphy added: “This work adds to our knowledge of the likely origins of leprosy in Medieval Ireland and will hopefully stimulate further research into the history and spread of this ancient disease across the world.”Belfast murder victim’s family need answers, vigil told Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It cannot be dismissed as a mere blip.Business Secretary Greg Clark says a majority of lsquoone or tworsquo is not enough Mr Clarkrsquos call came after Mrs Mayrsquos announcement that she intends toto Brussels to re-open negotiations on the controversial Northern Ireland backstop was met with a firm rebuff from European leaders.In a telephone call on Wednesday evening, Irish Premier Leo Varadkar told her recent events only underlined the need for a backstop that was ldquolegally robust and workable in practice.The Prime Minister also spoke to European Council president Donald Tusk in what was described as an ldquoopen and frank conversation, according to reports from Brussels.Afterwards, he tweeted: ldquoThe EU position is clear and consistent. The Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.Mrs Mayrsquos strategy secured a rare show of unity from the warring wings of the Conservative Party ndash as well as her allies in the DUP ndash in the Commons on Tuesday.My message to PM @theresa_may: The EU position is clear and consistent. The Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation. Yesterday, we found out what the UK doesnt want. But we still donrsquot know what the UK does want. #brexitmdash Donald TuskJanuary , However, Mr Clark suggested she needed to find an agreement that could command broader support across the Houseit was to survive.ldquoNot only do I think it is necessary for people to come together across partisan lines,we are properly to move forward I donrsquot think we should aim for this deal to pass by a majority of one or two. I would like to a substantial majority for a deal, he told ITVrsquos Peston programme.While the Government remained committed to securing an independent trade policy, he said it was right to listen to other views ndash including calls for a customs union.ldquoI think it is reasonable going into discussions to listen to peoplersquos views and to see where the majority is in the House of Commons ndash and for a substantial majority.ldquoI would want to see what proposals are there.

I canrsquot see that those technical possibilities are there yet, he said.His comments came after Mrs May met privately with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ndash who does support a customs union ndash to discuss the way forward on Brexit.In a further attempt to build cross-party support, Mr Clark ndash who has been holding talks with union leaders ndash suggested the Government could legislate to protect workersrsquo rights after Britain has left the EU.ldquoThe unions have some concerns that the deal that has been negotiated would somehow involve workersrsquo rights being diluted in this country. That is the opposite of our intention, he said.ldquoGiven that is the opposite of the intention, it seems to me common sense would say letrsquos turn that intention into legal text ndash legislation.Meanwhile, The Times reported the Prime Minister is preparing to woo rebel Labour MPs into supporting her deal with an injection of cash into deprived areas which voted Leave in the  referendum, including former mining communities.Thursdayrsquos TIMES: ldquoMay woos Labour MPs with cash to back Brexit #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic WXXyIHcXQtmdash Allie Hodgkins-BrownJanuary , Mrs May is due to report back to Parliament on her negotiations with the EU on February , with a further series of votes by MPs expected the following day.Reports have suggested she could face a wave of resignations by pro-Remain ministersshe does not at that point finally rule out a no-deal Brexit.Asked whether he would vote to block no-deal, Mr Clark said: ldquoI have always been very clear that to leave in a disorderly way on March  would be very bad for everyone in the economy.ldquoI will do everything that I can to make sure that doesnrsquot happen.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos.
