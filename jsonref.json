According to The Balance, Diana’s estate consisted of stocks in addition to her £17 million orce settlement.It also included jewellery, dresses and other personal belongings that were valued at approximately £21 million on the day that she died and netted her heirs £13 million, after taxes. But who did she leave her possessions to?She signed her last will and testament on June 1, 1993, but modified the will with a codicil on February 1, 1996. The will stated that her estate would be left in equal shares in trust to her sons until they became 25, with her mother, Frances Ruth Shand Kydd and her sister, Lady Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia McCorquodale, to act as co-executors and co-trustees.The codicil changed the trustees from her mother and her personal secretary, Commander Patrick Desmond Christian Jermy Jephson, to her mother and sister.However, it was reported that because her mother and sister did not like the provisions of the will, months after Diana’s death, they were able to distribute her estate differently after obtaining a secret variation order from the High Court of Justice.In addition to £50,000 that was left to her butler, Paul Burrell and ‘chattels’, or ‘personal effects’ which were left to her 17 godchildren, a Discretionary Fund was formed for Prince William, Prince Harry, their spouses, their descendants and charities, selected by the co-trustees.          Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer pose following the announcement of engagementThe Balance reported: ‘The Discretionary Fund received the following assets of the estate: intellectual property rights, all wearing apparel, £100,000, and accumulated income earned by the fund\u0027s assets.‘The Discretionary Fund is to be held for a Perpetuity Period which will last until 21 years after the death of the last surviving descendant of his late Majesty King George VI who was living on the date of Princess Diana\u0027s death.‘King George VI was the father of Queen Elizabeth II, grandfather of Prince Charles, great-grandfather of Prince William and Prince Harry, and the subject of the 2010 movie, The King\u0027s Speech.‘The income earned by the fund is to be distributed among the fund\u0027s beneficiaries during the Perpetuity Period as the trustees see fit. Anything left in the fund when it expires will go to the then living descendants of Prince William and Prince Harry.’What is referred to as the Residuary Estate was left in equal shares to William and Harry and the shares were held in trust until each Prince reached the age of 30. However, when they turned 25, they were given access to all the income and also, the power to change the final disposition of his trust if anything should remain at the time of his death.At the time of each Prince’s 30th birthday, their Residuary Estate shares were worth £10 million each.          Kate Middleton wears engagement ring of Diana, Princess of Wales, as she poses for the mediaWhat Kate Middleton inherited from Princess DianaAccording to The Telegraph, Diana’s Letter of Wishes stated: ‘But I would like you to allocate all my jewelry to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it. I leave the exact ision of the jewelry to your discretion.’After Prince William’s marriage to Kate Middleton, she has been repeatedly compared to Princess Diana and has also been spotted wearing her late mother-in-law’s jewellery. As reported in Good Housekeeping, the first piece that was given to Kate was her engagement ring.While rumours emerged that Harry had picked out the ring originally, after seeing William’s love for Kate, he traded the sapphire gem for his mother’s Cartier watch. William carried the ring with him for three weeks while they were on holiday in Mount Kenya in 2010 and eventually proposed.When the engagement was announced, the Duke of Cambridge said: ‘It’s my mother’s engagement ring, and it’s very special to me, as Kate is very special to me now as well. It was only right the two were put together. It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement.’As mentioned above, Kate has also been seen wearing the Lover’s Knot Tiara, which was made in 1914 with diamonds and pearls. It was given to Princess Diana by The Queen as a wedding present and once Kate married into the Royal Family, she inherited the piece.The Duchess of Cambridge also inherited a pair of sapphire earrings from Diana in 2010, but they have since been updated to a drop style. Alongside this, Kate was also seen wearing a pearl bracelet, by Nigel Milne in 1988. While it wasn’t as iconic as the other pieces, the Duchess chose to wear it at a reception in Berlin.          Meghan Markle is seen here wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring which belonged to DianaWhat will Kate inherit from Diana when the Queen dies?Kate Middleton could also reportedly inherit Princess Diana’s title of Princess of Wales when The Queen passes away and Prince Charles becomes King, according to Elle. Prince William will become William, Prince of Wales and Kate, the title of Princess of Wales.The People’s Princess was the last person to hold this title after Camilla, Charles’ second wife declined taking up the title out of respect for her husband’s first wife.Who is the next Bachelor 2019?

He didn\u0027t know what happened. \u0027The man was touching us with his hands under our knickers. It went on for around 50 seconds. He just kept doing it and doing it. I was thinking: \u0027Get off me.\u0027\u0027I was about to whack his hand away but I felt too scared. I didn\u0027t say anything to him. I was just scared and he did the same thing to my sister.\u0027She had no idea what was going on. We were chasing the cats and he offered if we wanted to come into his room as he had a lot of cats.

I was upset and I just felt weird afterwards. I just felt uncomfortable.\u0027Saleem denied wrongdoing. He told the jury: \u0027The parents were sorting out their room and I left my room open in case they needed something.\u0027I dozed off and I became aware of the children had come into my room and were stroking the cats. \u0027A few moments later their father came into the room and apologised to me for them disturbing me and he took the children out.

The species is now protected. Hvalur hf, owned by multi-millionaire Kristján Loftsson, caused uproar mid-July, when it was revealed it had killed a pregnant blue-fin whale hybrid, reportedly by mistake.

Chatham Historic Dockyard: The Dockyard is the backdrop for many historical dramas. This location is famously used for Call The Midwife. The Historic Dockyard Chatham s 80 acres, has over 100 buildings and structures dating from the Georgian and Victorian periods to the present day, making it an attractive location for period filming          British soldiers (pictured) helping a wounded comrade in one of the Waterloo scenes which took five days to shoot In fact, 50 trained Spanish horses were used for the five-day shoot. ‘These horses are actors,’ says production designer Anna Pritchard.‘They could rear, stumble and fall on command, they were taught amazingly well.’Finding the right location to recreate the battle proved difficult. The field needed a slope, which the Duke of Wellington used to hide some of his troops, and an elm tree, which he stood under as he watched the battle. ‘We searched high and low for the right field with the right trees and the right type of slope,’ says Anna. ‘We found one near Reading.’Four hundred supporting artists went through a Napoleonic war boot camp learning how to march, use a bayonet, hold a rifle and fire a cannon. For the actors, it was an experience they won’t ever forget. ‘It was one of the most exciting weeks I’ve ever had,’ says Charlie Rowe, whose character George Osborne is in the thick of it. ‘We were lying flat on the ground as this army of Napoleonic soldiers walked through the smoke towards us. It was completely terrifying.

He told the jury: \u0027The parents were sorting out their room and I left my room open in case they needed something.\u0027I dozed off and I became aware of the children had come into my room and were stroking the cats. \u0027A few moments later their father came into the room and apologised to me for them disturbing me and he took the children out.

Hearing two of its members enthuse about the limitless possibilities offered by a brochure of fibre-cement sheeting, you get a taste of the combination of poetry and pragmatism behind their new £4.2m home for Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art.“It is a very cheap material,” says Adam Willis, who led the project with Paloma Strelitz, pointing to the corrugated boards that they have used to clad part of the building. “But it also has this special handmade quality, and it comes in an amazing range of profiled ridges and flashing details.” The architects have reworked this off-the-peg kit of parts, usually used for barn rooftops, to form a carefully panelled facade, each element hand-stained a watery bluish grey in their studio workshop to elevate it above the farmyard norm.It is an inventive fusion of the industrial and the crafted that runs throughout the project, which has seen the boiler house and laundry rooms of a Victorian bath house in New Cross, south London, transformed into a beguiling new gallery complex for Goldsmiths’ art college. It is the first substantial permanent building by the Turner prize-winning collective, and it fulfils all the promise of their fleeting temporary structures – and more.Turner fame was a long way off when Assemble won the competition to design the building in 2014, with little more than a couple of pop-up cinemas to their name. The loose competition brief focused on creating access to the distinctive cast-iron water tanks that sit atop the brick building, which stands as a demure neighbour to Will Alsop’s ebullient visual arts faculty, a big glass box crowned with a metallic scribble. But Assemble saw the potential to open up more of the labyrinthine complex with a series of strategic cuts and insertions. They thew everything at it, building a huge doll’s house model that prised open to reveal a cross-section through their proposed galleries, complete with tiny installations in situ, which wowed the judges and helped them beat off competition from established gallery specialists including Jamie Fobert, 6a and Tate Modern architect Harry Gugger.It was a brave choice from Goldsmiths, but the risk has paid off. The resulting project feels excavated as much as made, a series of spaces that have been discovered and their special qualities amplified, along with a pair of crisp top-lit white cube galleries as a foil to the industrial grit. It is light-touch in some places, meticulously refined in others.The defining move is made in the centre of the building, where a great chunk of the ground floor has been chopped out to create a deep double-height project space that plunges into the basement. It is first encountered in a theatrical moment, from a series of Juliet balconies at ground level, some framed in existing openings, some sliced through the brickwork. The internal walls have been left as a raw record of the building, like a geological section cut through the ground, revealing sedimentary layers of patched masonry, glazed white bricks, old oak lintels and the sawn-off ends of iron beams, descending to meet a series of atmospheric basement galleries below.“We wanted to make the variety and idiosyncrasy of the existing spaces their defining feature,” says Strelitz, “and contrast them with two new galleries that could offer different qualities of light.” The new rooms have been inserted as lightweight steel-framed boxes, lined with white walls and oak floors, one lit by clearstory windows, the other by a central lantern, providing neutral space either side of the brooding water tanks, whose dark, rusty heft has been left exposed. Walk though a door in the tank and you find that half the roof has been removed, creating a surreal sculpture terrace, framed by the riveted iron panels. In a similar moment of delight, the staircase that leads here takes you past a big window on the landing that offers a glimpse into the old swimming pool hall, converted to airy painting studios in the 1990s, providing a view into the working life of the art school.Throughout, there are details that show the architects’ interest in how the building has been made and altered over time, and an awareness that their interventions are part of the ongoing life of the place, forming a richly layered canvas for artists to add to in turn. Sections of great sausage-like water pipes, which bulge from the ceiling with Heath Robinson glee, have been coated with a deep blue micaceous paint, used on German railways, giving them a sparkly sheen. Cast-iron beams in the ceiling of one room have been painted gold and the patchy edges of cement repairs to an old stone staircase highlighted in white, rather than smoothed over. A big shop window at ground level will one day face on to a new plaza, when a cluster of 1960s prefabs are eventually removed.Much of the magic derives from the unorthodox way that the 17-strong practice operates, making many of the components themselves through their construction company, Assemble Builders. They have cast beautiful, glossy salmon-pink cement panels for the reception desk and cafe counter, ridged to echo the corrugated cladding, and made blue marbled tiles for the splashbacks in the loos. Revealing an obsessive level of care, they also developed their own rusty brown timber stain for the ceiling in the tanks, by dissolving wire wool in vinegar. Granby Workshop, part of the project they initiated in Liverpool for which they won the Turner prize, has produced a series of bone china lampshades for the cafe, sponged with speckles of brick aggregate, while Assemble even designed the cafe chairs. Paper-thin sheets of steel have been crimped, riveted and chemically passivated to give them a golden rainbow glow, like soap bubbles on legs. They have a comfy spring to them too.The bricolage quality of the building has been cranked up a notch for the opening show with the choice of Mika Rottenberg, a New York-based Argentine artist who constructs immersive sets to show her absurdist video work. The whole place has been taken over by a series of false rooms, suspended ceilings, revolving partitions and dripping air conditioning units – as well as a twitching ponytail poking through a hole in a wall, as if one of the Assemblers got trapped, mid-construction.“It’s a university gallery, so we’re trying to show different kinds of exhibition-making,” says CCA director Sarah McCrory. She says the next exhibitions will leave the galleries more open, with work by Estonian artist Kris Lemsalu and a posthumous show of works from the 1970s by radical feminist photographer Alexis Hunter. “There will be research and historical shows as well as new commissions,” she adds. “The programme is purposefully all over the place.”Like the building, McCrory brings an inventive and slightly anarchic attitude to bear. In Assemble’s multilayered exhibition factory, she couldn’t have a better place to experiment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0901200f4e10e1be68c168dba4b7d0d51b121d12/0_649_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6fa43e59ef6e4a7cd39d34c3b6c0da5","title":"taylor wessing photographic portrait prize 2018 shortlist announced","story":"Portrait of South African drum majorette also on shortlist for prestigious photography awardA photograph of a woman holding her baby daughter has been shortlisted for one of the world’s most prestigious photography awards along with shoppers, a drum majorette and a child from a remote village in Sierra Leone.The National Portrait Gallery in London announced the shortlist on Thursday for the Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize – four images chosen from 4,462 submissions by 1,973 photographers from 70 countries.Nicholas Cullinan, the gallery director who chairs the jury, said the variety of approaches, techniques and styles of photographs submitted this year had been “particularly striking”.Enda Bowe, an Irish photographer based in London, is shortlisted for Cybil McAddy with daughter Lulu from a series called Clapton Blossom. Bowe said he was trying to find “the colour and beauty in the urban, the light in the grey”.A double portrait of two unnamed shoppers in central London is the shortlisted work of the London-born photographer Max Barstow, from his series Londoners. Barstow said his aim had been to “make unposed portraits with the intensity of images made by great studio photographers such as Richard Avedon and Irving Penn”. The photograph was taken in the middle of a crowd, he said, freezing a pair of friends shopping in the busy flow of a summer Sunday afternoon.Alice Mann, a South African photographer based in London, is shortlisted for a portrait of Keisha Ncube, a drum majorette, from her series Drummies, shot in South Africa’s Western Cape.“For these girls, involvement in ‘drummies’ becomes a vehicle for them to excel, and the distinctive uniforms serve as a visual marker of perceived success and represents emancipation from their surroundings,” Mann said.The fourth photographer shortlisted is Joey Lawrence, born in Canada and based in Brooklyn, for his Portrait of “Strong” Joe Smart. The image is from a series commissioned by WaterAid, shot in Tombohuaun (Tombo’s wound) – a remote village in the jungle of Sierra Leone’s Eastern Province that struggles with waterborne illnesses.“Rather than just creating images that underscored Tombohuaun’s plight, WaterAid and I envisioned a portrait study of the community that would highlight its resilience, its fraternity, its highly organised structure and its work ethic,” Lawrence said.All four images will be part of the annual photographic prize exhibition, with the winner, who will receive £15,000, announced on 16 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80106951faf2aa01e14b3e3614f0151be33ee561/0_511_7349_4408/master/7349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e2aab3c39f23f3daaf57139296d0450","title":"portrait of britain today british journal of photography","story":"Annual photography exhibition Portrait of Britain features 100 portraits selected by the British Journal of Photography from an open-call competition.

So I don’t think of it as being up against opponents, just as being in glorious and honoured company,” he wrote.Murakami, frequently a frontrunner for the Nobel prize for literature, is “one of our most celebrated authors and translators”, said the New Academy, whose work, which includes the novels Norwegian Wood and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, “fuses pop culture with a fierce magic realism”.The shortlist is completed with two female writers. The novelist Maryse Condé, whose works include Desirada and Segu, is “one of the Caribbean’s most outstanding authors”, according to the New Academy, writing about “how colonialism has changed the world and how those affected take back their heritage”. Kim Thúy, who was born in Saigon and grew up in Canada, is the final nominee. “Her stories paint the colours of Vietnam and the scents and flavours too, as well as the perils of exile and search for identity,” said the New Academy.The New Academy prize seeks to reward a writer who tells the story of “humans in the world”, in comparison with the Swedish Academy members, who select the Nobel winner producing “the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”.“The New Academy was founded to warrant that an international literary prize will be awarded in 2018, but also as a reminder that literature should be associated with democracy, openness, empathy and respect,” said the New Academy, which will be dissolved in December, once the prize has been presented.“In a time when human values are increasingly being called into question, literature becomes the counterforce of oppression and a code of silence. It is now more important than ever that the world’s greatest literary prize should be awarded.”No Nobel prize for literature will be awarded in 2018, with the Swedish Academy tentatively planning to announce two winners in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/412813c0ba584df790e3b3e74f54f562fdd7566c/0_174_3985_2391/master/3985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fe0672466d91fcdf444dfcf6e5ccab7","title":"argentina raises interest rates to 60 to shore up peso","story":"The Argentine central bank raised the cost of borrowing by 15 percentage points on Thursday in an attempt to shore up the peso, which has plummeted in value.The latest developments come as the US dollar gathers strength this year with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, reminiscent of the early 1990s when tighter monetary policy under the former Fed chairman, Alan Green, triggered a series of crises across the developing world.Having approached the International Monetary Fund for emergency support amid an unfolding economic crisis, Argentina asked the Washington-based lender of last resort earlier this week to accelerate the release of the money to bolster its finances.The country has asked to borrow $50bn from the IMF to restore confidence in its finances amid high levels of government debt in dollars, which have become more expensive to pay off as the dollar strengthens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae5134754d8faa677125792ea5d57f2f33ebd976/0_101_4266_2559/master/4266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=966ba3ac40479003c67aeb67fbc17746","title":"pound boosted michel barnier brexit hint business live","story":"Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator for Europe, said the bloc is prepared to offer the UK a unique deal, helping the pound against the dollar and the euroThe pound has managed to stay above the $1.30 mark, after comments from Michel Barnier boosted hopes that a Brexit deal will be struck.The EU’s chief negotiator said “we are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country”.Meanwhile a report that France’s President Emmanuel Macron will push for a deal with Britain also raised the possibility of a softer approach from the EU.Pressure is mounting on Canada and the US as a Friday deadline looms for a new NAFTA agreement.

The only comparable downturn is the 1930s Great Depression in the US. However, then US real GDP was back to its pre-crisis peak after seven years. Here is a Q\u0026ampA on what Wonga’s collapse would mean for its customers:Jonathan Reynolds, Labour MP and shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the news that payday lender Wonga has stopped taking new loan applications:We need urgent action from the government to change this broken model and review the way lending is regulated.I cannot mourn the demise of Wonga. Its business model was exploitative and immoral. Wonga had become a testament to so much that is wrong with our economy - too many people stuck in insecure employment reliant on short term debt just to keep their heads above water.That is why the next Labour government will lift living standards and tackle the persistent debt spiral that many working families have become trapped in by capping exploitative lending, increasing real wages, and ending austerity.With equity markets across Europe still falling and US futures down, Connor Campbell at Spread Ex considers why investors are in a glum mood: The sentiment in Europe remained sour, with all the major indices catching a serious case of the blues.It is hard to pinpoint the exact reason for the downturn. A lack of distraction arguably puts Brexit and the US-China trade war at the forefront of investors’ minds, though on both fronts there has been slight progress, with Barnier’s bullish comments in relation to the former, and the US-Mexico trade deal (admittedly a tenuous positive) in regards to the latter. Regardless of the reason, the Dow Jones is set to join the end of August malaise after the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures pointing to a 90 points drop when the US session gets underway. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda, says the more positive tone on Brexit struck by the EU could be the first step towards taking a no deal scenario off the table, which would be supportive of the pound.The pound is paring gains but continues to trade around four week highs against the dollar, with the currency having been buoyed on Wednesday by comments from Michel Barnier who claimed to be open to the idea of a bespoke Brexit deal for the UK, something the EU had appeared averse to previously.The apparent softening in the language, combined with French President Emmanuel Macron’s desire to maintain close ties, come at a time when a no deal Brexit was looking increasingly likely.The latest comments suggest there is a strong desire within the EU to find a solution and avoid a no deal Brexit which is understandably good for the UK and the pound. Sterling had come under pressure in recent months as the prospect of no deal became more of a possibility but this is hopefully the first step towards it not becoming a reality.

My thoughts are with the survivors of his shocking and disgusting acts.The Green party has, rightly, faced questions about its association with David Challenor, who in the past has acted as an election agent for his daughter and whose own membership of the party has now been terminated with immediate effect. Our governance bodies have established an urgent and independent formal investigation and a review of the party’s safeguarding and child protection procedures, and Aimee has stepped back from her spokesperson role, as well as withdrawing as a candidate in our current leadership elections.I have faced many calls for immediate action against Aimee – calls that fail to understand the very limited powers I have as a party co-leader and that assume I would be prepared to ditch the fundamental right to due process and a fair hearing. Justice and truth must not be further victims of David Challenor’s crimes and nor must trans people’s rights.That Aimee Challenor is a trans woman should not be relevant here yet others have tried to make a connection. While we can all agree that what her father did was monstrous, the transphobia unleashed against her on social media is absolutely unacceptable. So too is the aggressive and regressive vilification of those wanting to discuss trans issues. There have been bomb threats and bots systematically blocking women on social media to try to silence those who are asking whether trans rights put women’s rights at risk. If we want a more equal society we need to talk about how to get there. The positive response to high-profile celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner has done little to change the fact that trans people experience high rates of suicide, poverty and persecution. Rather than name-calling and accusations of bullying, tackling the routine exclusion and discrimination trans people face requires listening and learning.My party has long recognised that trans women are women and trans men are men. That’s been upheld by the law since 2004 and gender dysphoria is a widely recognised medical condition. I, like many others, have faced my own journey when it comes to understanding a new way of thinking about gender – one that’s resulted in understanding how the idea of gender that’s underpinned my lifelong feminism is very different to what it means and how it feels to be a trans person. For example, I personally still find it very challenging that there is often so much focus on body parts, when a fundamental tenet of my feminism has been that gender is a construct independent of vagina and ovaries.I don’t have the answers to all the difficult questions that are being asked. What I do have is a firm commitment to looking at the facts rather than being swayed by fear and speculation. Take one example: despite what you might read elsewhere, there’s no evidence that allowing trans people to self-declare will open doors for predators intent on abusing or attacking women and girls. Rather, obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC) will not change anything much other than removing the obstacles for trans people wanting, for example, an amended birth certificate or driving licence. It does not in any way affect whether a person presents as a man or woman on a daily basis.If an inidual wants to present as a different gender to the one they were assigned at birth, they do not need to go through the self-declaration process to do so. In many of the instances about which there are concerns – for example, women-only spaces being abused – self-declaration will make no difference. Women are not asked to prove their gender when they access refuges or other domestic violence support services, and trans women are already able to access these spaces without any documentation whatsoever. Anyone seeking to cause harm to women can already also try to access these spaces or services, which are in turn entitled to take action if they think a user or potential user poses a risk to others.I’ve not seen any evidence that self-declaration has been routinely abused to gain illegitimate access to women-only spaces in any of the countries where self-declaration already exists. Nor is the theoretical possibility that iniduals might undergo gender reassignment for abusive purposes a good basis for law-making. It’s also worth noting that a GRC is a legal document, and results in someone’s details being formally recorded. Anyone seeking to cause abuse would be drawing attention to themselves by using that route, and it’s far more likely that most people with illegal intentions will seek to operate under the radar.I understand people’s fears, but they must not be used to justify the demonisation of trans people or the denial of their rights, nor as an opportunity to claim that women’s rights are at risk from trans equality. It also detracts from the important work of dismantling our patriarchal social structures. Of creating a society in which we are all truly equal, free and empowered to choose how we live our lives – including the right to choose a different gender to the one assigned at birth and to live free from any gender construct imposed by society.We are living through a time of huge change in our understanding of the way gender works and the way it can be used to oppress others. We will survive not by turning on one another but by defending the right to free speech, protecting against hate crimes, finding a way through the current debate about trans rights that’s respectful of one another and the facts, and refusing to engage in violence and abuse. We will survive by focusing on our shared objective – for all women, whether cis, trans, lesbian, disabled or women of colour, to feel safe.I’m sure I’ve not got everything right, but I believe what matters most is being committed to continuing to learn. Publishing this piece may well bring down anger upon my head and I have thought long and hard about whether to do it. What helped me decide is knowing that unless we’re prepared to listen to each other, and to debate the way forward honestly and respectfully, we’ll never make progress towards the future I believe is possible. I will continue to do all I can to ensure the Green party plays a constructive role and learns the lessons it needs to.• Caroline Lucas is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales, and the MP for Brighton Pavilion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40e5aba3243bde8503efe30c637bf93b35c934de/0_161_4790_2874/master/4790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=578d627e1b13e35ac0c4ed7eea456f41","title":"tories ukip britain entryism","story":"They are unlikely to be devotees of Theresa May’s zombie premiership. The hard-right businessman Arron Banks is spearheading an effort to recruit tens of thousands of supporters of Leave.EU – an organisation that spews anti-Muslim and anti-migrant bile across social media – to the Conservatives. A party that receives more money from the dead than the living is certainly ripe for takeover. The Tory hierarchy is set to be devoured by the monsters it suckled and reared.Let us consider how this act of political matriphagy was made possible. Cameron may have tried to reinvent himself as a husky-hugging social liberal who wanted his party to stop “banging on about Europe”, but he recognised that only a candidate burnishing their Eurosceptic credentials could hope to become leader. When he committed to leave the centre-right European EPP-ED grouping in favour of an alliance with right-wing extremists, he whetted the appetite of his party’s hard-right flank. They would always come back for more, emboldened by every concession.Cameron talked up immigration as a problem to be dealt with while setting impossible targets that were never met, fuelling popular discontent. He announced an EU referendum at the start of 2013, hoping it would appease his backbenchers and lance the Ukip boil. But it was only afterwards that Nigel Farage’s fortified purple army surged in the polls. When Cameron’s friends Michael Gove and Boris Johnson – whose careers he had supported – used the referendum to betray him, their campaign whipped up hysteria about immigrants, further boosting the hard right. As Brexit turfed Cameron out of No 10, his party’s right believed they were the vanguard of a national revolution.And it was May who played the decisive role. The politician who sent racist “Go home” vans around ethnically erse communities was a natural fit for the job. She clothed herself in the garments of the populist right, sticking it to their loathed, caricatured “liberal elite”, who were now “citizens of nowhere”. Right-wing columnists favourably compared her to Enoch Powell. Tory outriders in the press portrayed dissenters and critics as traitors and saboteurs the Daily Mail ran its infamous “Enemies of the people” front page. The paper’s political editor, James Slack, became her official spokesperson and press secretary.May’s strategists hungrily eyed the 4 million voters who plumped for Farageism in 2015 their mouths watering at the Labour-held constituencies whose MPs had smaller majorities than Ukip’s vote tally. By embracing Ukiperry, they calculated, the red-rosetted heartlands of the north and Midlands would tumble to the Tories. “No deal is better than a bad deal,” she declared, normalising a position of extremism. She resorted to immigration-bashing and championing grammar schools – no wonder Farage was ecstatic, noting she was “running on exactly the same ticket” and “using exactly the same words of phrases I have been using for 20 years”.Hubris was met by nemesis: on polling day, working-age Britain decisively rejected the Tories, and their support among minority communities shrank further. But, far from humbled, a hard right nurtured by the Tory hierarchy became hungrier still. Normalised and radicalised by Cameron and May, they had grown tired of extracting concessions from weak leaders: now they must have one of their own.And so now the Ukip army – once derided by Cameron as “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists” – is flooding into Conservative associations, hoping to remodel the party in its own image. Jacob Rees-Mogg may be an unlikely shout as leader, – would Tory MPs really put him on a shortlist of two to present to their membership? – but he may be the kingmaker, for a canny contender will crave his endorsement. Steve Bannon – now fashioning an international grouping of the far right – courts Rees-Mogg, Johnson and Gove. A hard right takeover is within sight.The nation should fear the consequences: a lethal brew of bigotry, deregulation and rolling back the state beyond Thatcher’s wildest fantasies. And how have these extremists come so close to capturing the British state? The answer is as obvious as it is damning. A combination of the Tory leadership and the Tory press mothered them, just as the Republican hierarchy reared Trumpism. Before, they were too weak to do anything but piggyback. But my, haven’t they grown. And now they may well devour the Conservative party – and become Britain’s new political masters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8186656cda805b3291f13e5eaa9c52be127a10f/0_206_2664_1598/master/2664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ab35f7e4c1f0ba2ef7d28e69ba81aaf","title":"john ruskin artists victorian social critic","story":"He believed life should be beautiful, inequality was an outrage and that capitalism leads to aesthetic degradation. No wonder the quintessential Victorian speaks so powerfully to our timesIt is a familiar tableau of urban Britain. Labourers dig a tunnel, a porter delivers goods, a man swigs beer, there are young children and dogs, police and aristocrats look on there is dirt and beauty and life all thrown together. Ford Madox Brown’s pre-Raphaelite painting Work (c 1852-63) has been reworked many times. In the latest effort, the comic artist Hunt Emerson gives it a knockabout cartoon feel, but with a distinctly current edge: the cast is multicultural, the tools more hi-tech and there are allusions to social dysfunction, the gig economy and the housing crisis.Emerson’s update also alludes to the social critiques of Brown’s contemporary and friend, John Ruskin: a writer, artist, social critic, polymath and aesthete. Emerson’s illustration is the central image of A World of ... Work, an exhibition at Brantwood, Ruskin’s former home in Cumbria. It also figures in How to Work, a comic made in collaboration with writer Kevin Jackson, and one of three in their recent collection , Bloke’s Progress, a playful re-examining of Ruskin’s ideas through the eyes of a modern everyman, Darren Bloke.Ruskin was born in London in 1819 to a wealthy Scottish wine-merchant father and a strict Evangelical mother. Having graduated from Oxford University in 1842, he came to public prominence with his defence of JMW Turner, published in the first volume of his acclaimed treatise on art, Modern Painters. He gained fame as a public intellectual – writing, teaching and delivering lectures on art, architecture and other subjects, all in his eccentric style. Ruskin’s art criticism and advocacy was a particular inspiration to the pre-Raphaelites.In the 1860s, he turned his attention to politics and society against the backdrop of the inequality and rampant poverty many suffered in the industrial capitalist age. He railed against the exploitation of the poor and the self-interest of the wealthy. Ruskin proposed reform, and carried out practical projects – such as getting his students to work on widening roads in Oxford – which provided a hands-on social parable for his beliefs. While much of his thinking was considered radical, and could be considered a precursor to socialism, he adhered to an older conservative tradition that believed in hierarchy and the established authority it also suggested that those who naturally held power had a duty to serve and protect the poor. By the mid-20th century, some of his ideas had filtered into the perceived wisdom of the British welfare state.“In some ways, Ruskin seems like the most Victorian of the Victorians, so not applicable to our lives now,” says David Russell, associate professor of English at Corpus Christi College Oxford. “People get hung up on how eccentric some of his ideas were, but the core of his claims remains relevant and important. That is to say: our aesthetic experience, our experience of beauty in ordinary life, must be central to thinking about any good life and society. It’s not just decoration or luxury for the few. If you are taught how to see the world properly through an understanding of aesthetics, then you’ll see society properly.”Ruskin, who died in Brantwood in 1900, has been cited as an influence on William Morris and Gandhi, the arts and craft movement, ecological thinking and the foundations of the welfare state. His most searing social critique is contained in his 1860-62 essays, Unto This Last, in which he takes a scythe to Victorian capitalist values: “the art of establishing maximum inequality in our own favour … the rash and absurd assumption that such inequalities are necessarily advantageous, lies at the root of most of the popular fallacies on the subject of political economy”.In his conclusion, Ruskin states baldly: “Luxury is indeed possible in the future – innocent and exquisite luxury for all, and by the help of all but luxury at present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant the cruellest man living could not sit at his feast, unless he sat blindfolded.”A central line of thinking for Ruskin, cutting across his art criticism and political writing, is that a society founded on structures that are embroiled in heartlessness – in brutal treatment of people and the environment around them – is indifferent to beauty. As we see the growth of vast inequalities today, such billionaire tech firms employing precarious workers with diminished rights and pervasive environmental ruin, it is not hard to see parallels in our current moment.This year, David Zwirner Books published the long out-of-print Giotto and His Works in Padua, Ruskin’s consideration of the Italian painter’s 12th-century fresco cycle at the Arena Chapel in northern Italy. Even here, when contemplating the beauty of early Renaissance art, Ruskin writes: “As long as it can bear to see misery and squalor in its streets, it can neither invent nor accept human beauty in its pictures.” As Robert Hewison adds in an introduction to the new edition: “Is this 1860, or 2018?”Whether Ruskin remains an influence on the left, however, is another matter. “There is an important echo in contemporary radicalism,” says Jeremy Gilbert, a member of the founding national committee of Momentum and a professor of cultural and political theory at the University of East London. “Ruskin is not really much of a presence in contemporary left culture, but there are definitely resonances, especially in the popularisation of post-work politics.”Ruskin’s criticism of the alienating nature of work and the aesthetic impoverishment of industrial capitalism chimes with current arguments about inequality and the despoiling of the environment. But, for Gilbert, “it’s never clear with Ruskin what the strategy was meant to be politically to resolve the problem.”Where Ruskin’s continuing political influence is concerned, Gilbert says he remains central to an ethical-socialist radical tradition, a belief-system embraced by Tony Benn and even Jeremy Corbyn, whose “own vision of the world is a moral one: it’s not really about class struggles, so much as it is about wanting a moral and ethical society”. While Ruskin is not widely cited by the left today, this concept is something he espoused. Gilbert suggests that the strongest link between Ruskin and contemporary discourse lies in the possibility that automation might be a liberation – allowing people to lead more creative and and aesthetically fulfilled lives because they don’t have to do boring work anymore. In Unto This Last, Ruskin offers, in his elaborate style, exhortations: “The equality of wages, then, being the first object towards which we have to discover the directest available road, the second is … that of maintaining constant numbers of workmen in employment.”There are also provocations: “Whereas it has long been known and declared that the poor have no right to the property of the rich, I wish it also to be known and declared that the rich have no right to property of the poor.”And there are dramatic paeans to what might be possible. “There is no wealth but life. Life including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration,” he writes. “That country is richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings.”When Ruskin did publish his social criticism, there was a backlash from his audience: the wealthy, educated elite. The essays that became Unto This Last were originally published in Cornhill magazine but he had to end the series because his editor, William Thackeray, along with much of the readership, were horrified, Russell explains. The economic establishment were contemptuous and said he had no practical business insight to draw on. The World of Work exhibition in Brantwood, which runs until this weekend, considers how artists have responded to human labour, and is underpinned by Ruskin’s writing on the laissez-faire capitalism of the Victorian industrial age. Alongside Emerson’s update of Work, there is a very broad interpretation: George Mason’s rural idyll The Harvest Moon, John Cassidy’s sculpture The Ship Canal Digger and AS Finlayson’s paintings of an aero-engine production line offer optimistic and noble visions of work. Set against these are stark visions in paintings like Peasant Woman with a Pitchfork by James Pelham and Graham Sutherland’s Press for Making Shells. The exhibition runs into the present day, with images including Jonathan Ive’s design for the iPhone.The David Zwirner Books edition of Ruskin’s writing about Giotto is part of the gallery and publisher’s Ekphrasis series – reissuing largely out-of-print writing on visual arts by the likes of Vernon Lee, Marcel Proust, Alice Michel and Paul Gauguin. “When I was in university, I don’t think I was ever taught Ruskin,” says Lucas Zwirner, the managing editor of the imprint. “In his lifetime he was a celebrity. And then he was totally out of fashion. There’s such richness there that I think there are cycles of engagement – maybe we’re entering a place where people want a different kind of writing about visual art.”Zwirner says he was introduced to the Victorian due to his somewhat unlikely influence on the punk and counter-culture infused drawings of Raymond Pettibon – former Tate director Nicholas Serota also encouraged him to publish the Ruskin work. Ruskin is referenced directly in the title of The Ethics of Dust, a series by the artist, architect and preservationist Jorge Otero-Pailos. Here installations are created out of minute dirt, dust and matter that has accumulated over years at old buildings, including Westminster and Doge’s Palace in Venice. “It’s a really important part of the radical tradition to be able to say that one of the things wrong with capitalism in general is that it produces a certain kind of aesthetic degradation,” says Gilbert. “And that does speak to something that really intuitively, people recognise – not just aesthetes, not just intellectuals. Most people have a sense of the way in which corporate culture cannot produce beauty. It can appropriate it and sell access to it, but it can’t produce it.”There is a banner in the Brantwood exhibition that simply reads: “To Do Good Work”. It is by the Sheffield-based art partnership Poly-Technic, which uses words as polemic in its art, riffing on trade union banners and other types of sloganeering, as well as creating collective community projects that take messages out in public. “That was something Ruskin was doing,” says Howard Hull, the director of the Ruskin Foundation and Brantwood Trust. “He was making actions and finding words or concepts which could be taken out and used.“Famously, the first bit of writing that Ruskin ever did was three lines long: a little sermon that his mother got him to preach in the home on a Sunday, in which he stood up and proclaimed: ‘People be good’.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc8c4e07c2a7e00672b3364df1086628d66f73dc/1236_0_4524_2715/master/4524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838099c5768c3ef965fe66489edfa418","title":"physics teachers should be paid more to attract and retain talent report","story":"Fewer than 600 new physics teachers likely to end up in the classroom as applications plummetApplications from would-be physics teachers have plunged this year, as a new report recommends that graduates in high demand subjects be paid more in order to recruit and retain staff.The sharp decline means that fewer than 600 new physics teachers were likely to end up in the classroom – well below the 1,000 recruits needed every year just to meet current demand.Just one in five of those currently teaching physics at schools in England has a relevant degree, according to a new report from the Education Policy Institute (EPI), which has argued that the government needed to tackle shortages by paying more to teachers with degrees in maths and physics.According to the EPI, teachers in their late 20s with maths degrees earn around £4,000 a year less than their peers in the private sector.A DfE spokesperson said Damian Hinds, the education secretary, was committed to improving recruitment and retention, and noted that there were now more teachers working in state schools in England than in 2010.“We recently announced a fully-funded pay rise for classroom teachers and we are working with school leaders and unions on a strategy to drive recruitment and boost retention of teachers and strip away unnecessary workload,” the DfE said.David Laws, the former education minister who now chairs the EPI, said there was particular concern over the lack of subject specialists working in deprived areas outside London.“In maths, physics and chemistry, poor children are much more likely to be taught by teachers who don’t have relevant degrees. We need to make it more attractive for some of our best qualified teachers to teach in our most challenging schools,” Laws said.Fewer than one in five physics teachers in the most disadvantaged schools outside London have a relevant degree. In maths, around one in three have a relevant degree in disadvantaged schools, compared with around half of those teaching in more affluent areas.But the suggestion of higher pay for some subjects was rejected by the teaching unions.Nansi Ellis, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said that workload and the “punishing pressures of accountability” in state schools were driving teachers from the profession.“Putting the emphasis on pay supplements to maths and science teachers will not deal with these critical issues – it’s an attempt to find a cheap solution to the problem of uncompetitive pay levels across the whole range of teaching,” Ellis said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/348e5f1eb18c9472aecb7fb29a018eeea791932b/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf3d69acd54a752557788f870447a7b1","title":"destination wedding review keanu reeves winona ryder","story":"The 90s stalwarts boast a spiky chemistry in this slight, entertaining tale of two misanthropes begrudgingly bonding while attending a weddingMuch of the online excitement over the repairing of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder has little to do with their previous onscreen couplings and more to do with what they symbolise about a decade and a half in film. Does anyone really remember Francis Ford Coppola’s opulent imagining of Dracula for their stiff, awkwardly accented, chemistry-free scenes together? Was Richard Linklater’s A Scanner Darkly known predominantly as a vehicle for the two stars to showcase their rapport? Did they even share a scene in The Private Lives of Pippa Lee? Or instead, is there just an abundance of nostalgic thirst for a film focused entirely around Veronica SawyerLelaina PierceLydia Deetz hanging out with TedJohnny UtahJack Traven?It’s why there was such giddiness over a recent viral story that suggested the pair might actually have accidentally got married while filming Dracula. For many of us, they’re an extension of our youth, like absurdly attractive, staggeringly rich popular kids from school we envied from afar. Their reappearance transports us back to the heyday of their disaffected cool and any 90s kid inevitably enters their fourth film together with some unavoidable baggage. For such Reeves and Ryder fetishists, there’s plenty here to moon over, given that in Destination Wedding, they share more screentime than their other three outings combined.The reason for this is a rather nifty, if restrictive, gimmick that posits the pair in a variety of situations yet refuses to listen in on anything else happening outside of their interactions. It’s a bit like watching a play with just two characters, an 88-minute chamber piece, the enjoyment of which will depend on one’s tolerance for the duo. Given that they’re both playing bitchy misanthropes judging those around them, it’s also a bit like watching a nastier, sexier Statler and Waldorf let loose at a wedding. The nuptials in question are happening at a remote Californian location and the film opens with Frank (Reeves) and Lindsay (Ryder) meeting at the airport, developing an almost instant mutual disgust.They’re appalled to be going to a wedding, let alone a selfishly designed destination wedding, and the ensuing action, or rather lack thereof, sees them slowly bonding over their hatred for the world around them.It’s not unusual to see a romantic comedy that is a) set a wedding and b) unfolding between two characters who initially hate each other, but Destination Wedding does manage to spin these tired cliches into something somewhat fresh. While the backdrop is familiar, the script’s bracing cynicism turns it into a hellscape for our leads, who balk at the extravagance on display. Given that we’re not even given the chance to meet the bride and groom, all we have is acerbic commentary provided by two people who hate them both and most of the other guests while they’re at it. Writer-director Victor Levin, who brought similarly astute rat-a-tat dialogue to the underrated TV comedy Survivor’s Remorse, taps into that clandestine thrill of quietly berating those around you with someone who’s on the same, bitter page.While some of the dialogue does border on overwritten (“Why would you want me to perpetuate my circumstances?” etc), there’s enough wit and finely observed pedantry to make up for the occasional indulgence. In a slight film that’s almost wall-to-wall dialogue the pair criticise everything from each other to people who confuse formally with formerly to political correctness to wine bottles with screw tops to those assholes who take a free sample of salami at the supermarket and then drop the toothpick on the floor after. Such a barrage of unending nastiness might not be to everyone’s taste, and at times it can get a bit grating, but if you’ve suffered through enough weddings as a singleton, it might prove to be a rather addictive tonic.The pair share an easy, spiky chemistry and Reeves in particular shows himself to be surprisingly skilled at delivering such bile-filled dialogue. Given the staginess, Levin tries to force a few scenes of broad physical comedy with little success, although he does mine some laughs from an awkward field-based sex scene (“There’s kelp at or near my vagina,” Ryder complains as Reeves thrusts, bored). When the film inevitably lurches toward romance, it’s slightly frustrating that out of the two, it’s Ryder’s character whose cynicism melts into affection. It would have been far more interesting to see a gender switch there but still, the script mostly keeps its characters true to themselves. There’s no grand declaration of love, just the slow, oddly touching realisation that sometimes, the person who hates the same things as you just might be the person you hate the least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e15a2aed9839d4db2c89c09ca1abfba3015bef/0_415_1141_685/master/1141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65dd241ad1d9e230507d34c470ac68ce","title":"the man from mowax review from superstar james lavelle","story":"This hit-and-miss documentary charting the life and career of James Lavelle feels too much like a promoThe rise and fall of James Lavelle, the record label founder and DJ, is the subject of this celebratory music documentary by Matthew Jones. In the 1990s, Lavelle was music’s Damien Hirst – a cocky upstart with a genius for A\u0026ampR matched only by a gift for self-promotion. At 18, he opened the hip label Mo’Wax and helped to popularise trip-hop (though signing Tricky and Portishead evaded him). Everything he touched turned to gold, until it didn’t.Ego, money, drugs: Lavelle’s story has the makings of an entertaining account of the music business. But this film feels too much like a promo for a comeback attempt. Its greatest strength is archive from the personal collections of Lavelle and Josh Davis, AKA DJ Shadow, whose groundbreaking sample album Endtroducing marked Mo’Wax’s high point. The clubbing footage brings back a chemical rush of the 90s London dance scene. The problem is that Lavelle is unreflective about his journey to failure. The roots of his downfall seem to stem, in part, from a disastrous decision to sell the back catalogue to a big label and Lavelle’s cocaine-fuelled fantasy of becoming a rock star. To that end, he formed Unkle, a group with a revolving door of collaborators and celebrity appearances from the likes of Radiohead’s Thom Yorke and Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker. Two albums in, Lavelle went from coolest kid on the block to stadium rock bore. Unkle will perhaps be the least interesting of Lavelle’s work to music fans, yet a sizeable chunk of the film is devoted it. There is some unintentionally hilarious footage of Lavelle recording Unkle’s third album, when the “slebs” are clearly not picking up the phone.

It is like a disturbing dream – and certainly anything featuring Jeff Goldblum, Udo Kier and Denis Lavant is sure to offer a strong range of flavours at the very least. There are fascinating visual compositions: weird rectilinear tableaux made from the forbidding lines of hospital corridors and lonely motel balconies. Cinematographer Lorenzo Hagerman gives us colours that are bleached out and subdued, as if approximating what people with severe depression see.This is a film with an impressive, sometimes oppressive craft and technique – but it also feels unfinished. A sustained and rather brilliant conjuring of atmosphere, with some superb ambient music, finally succumbs to a rather banal inability to decide where to take the story and exactly how important the story has been. And it is disappointing that Goldblum’s tremendous and sometimes hilarious character disappears from the film, leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that there was so much more to say about him. He is, in effect, replaced with a ridiculous, scenery-gobbling turn from Lavant, which crowds out the final section of the picture.The period is the 1950s and Tye Sheridan plays Andy, a subdued and introspective young man employed at an ice rink where his father Frederick (Kier) is a skating instructor. Andy’s mother has been admitted to hospital with depression and when Frederick dies, Andy is free to re-establish the contact with her that his father forbade.But his tentative thoughts on these lines are immediately paralysed by the bizarre appearance in his life of a man who is to become a highly unlikely and unwholesome father figure – Dr Wallace Fiennes (Goldblum), the psychiatrist who it seems has carried out a lobotomy on Andy’s mother and has now been mysteriously “let go” by the hospital.Lobotomies are unfashionable in the world of mental-health care, which prefers tranquilliser drugs, and the now unemployed Dr Fiennes persuades Andy to join him on a very odd road trip, as his personal photographer, taking pictures of lobotomy patients in hospitals all over the country. He also performs this discredited operation as a roving freelance, often with disastrous results.Goldblum’s Fiennes is eccentric, dishevelled, garrulous and louche. His long grey hair is often disordered. He is in the habit of picking up women in bars with Andy as his mute wingman. There is a wonderful scene in which he mesmerises two women in a cafe by telling them which Hollywood stars they resemble. And it is during one such escapade that Andy has a sexual experience with a patient and conceives a new desire: to achieve a kind of telepathic oneness with his mother by undergoing one of Fiennes’s grisly procedures.Sexuality in this film is represented as transgressive and abusive. A miasma of denied shame is everywhere. Goldblum often relieves and redeems this unhappy atmosphere with his wit and droll elegance. I wonder if he improvised his comic set pieces. And yet his character turns out to have been going nowhere, like a preliminary sketch for a painting that we are not shown. It’s frustrating. A film with real cinematic language, but that does not say anything very convincing or substantial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d46dc6c9597726cbd818ea5e92d4426480cc0eb/0_213_3861_2317/master/3861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f114c946e024aac8079d3e0bc9b42956","title":"jamie oliver spent 13m to save italian chain hours before bankruptcy","story":"Chef reveals he still does not understand why restaurants ran into financial troubleJamie Oliver has revealed that his restaurant chain was hours from bankruptcy before he rescued it by injecting nearly £13m of his own money into the business.The celebrity chef and entrepreneur said he still did not fully understand why Jamie’s Italian ran into financial trouble and came close to collapse in September last year.He has since shut 12 of the chain’s 37 restaurants and made about 600 staff redundant in an attempt to save the rest of the operation.“We had simply run out of cash,” Oliver, 43, said in an interview with the Financial Times.“And we hadn’t expected it. That is just not normal, in any business. You have quarterly meetings. You do board meetings. People supposed to manage that stuff should manage that stuff.”Oliver got his big break when a visiting TV crew spotted him while he was working at the River Cafe in Hammersmith, leading to his own show The Naked Chef.Since then he has built a TV, publishing and restaurant empire, and amassed a net worth of £150m in 2017, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.Oliver said he injected £7.5m of this wealth into Jamie’s Italian, supplemented by a further £5.2m in the months that followed. The business had racked up debts of £71.5m.“I had two hours to put money in and save it or the whole thing would go to shit that day or the next day,” he said. “It was as bad as that and as dramatic as that.”The rescue plans also required £37m in loans from HSBC, as well as subsidies from other parts of Oliver’s businesses, among them Jamie Oliver Holdings, which oversees his publishing and media activity.But more than 10 months after the chain came close to bankruptcy, the chef said he was still unclear why it ran into difficulty.Jamie’s Italian was rescued via a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allowed for the closure of stores, a move Oliver insisted was necessary to save the remainder of the chain and 1,600 jobs.He also had to pursue a controversial “pre-pack” arrangement to save one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants, hiving it off into a new company with no responsibility for the original business’s debts.The group has said that suppliers initially left out of pocket have since been repaid.Oliver defended the business decisions taken by Paul Hunt, his brother-in-law and the chief executive of Jamie Oliver Group since 2014, who instigated a restructuring effort that was followed by allegations by former staff about a “bullying” style.He said: “Do you know why I chose him? Because he’s many things. But he’s honest, and he’s fair. I absolutely trust him.“His job was to come in and clean up. He has done the hardest and most fabulous job. I’m not saying that because he’s my brother-in-law. I’m saying it because it’s a fact.”Jamie Oliver has established a sprawling business empire since he was talent-spotted by a TV crew in 1997 while working at a restaurant in London.In 2015, Oliver shut the last branch of Recipease – his chain of cookery shops – and the last of his four British-themed Union Jacks restaurants went the same way two years later. Last October his food magazine, Jamie, ceased publication after almost 10 years, while his Jamie’s Italian chain was forced to cut jobs and close sites this year.But Oliver retains a wide range of lucrative culinary business interests, ranging from recipe books to wood-fired ovens.At Jamie Oliver Licensing, which covers his endorsements and range of products and tie-ups, pre-tax profit rose to £7.3m from £7m in 2016, according to accounts filed with Companies House.Profit at Jamie Oliver Holdings, which covers his media interests, rose to £5.4m from £1m.Oliver paid himself £10m in idends in 2016 – £6m from the licensing business and £4m from media. He has never taken any money from the restaurant business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea10cc2eeb3e54690d97eaf896303fb7e0ed1934/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=157bcf766064d9e24ecf318f19c32e04","title":"champions league draw clubs pots format when happening","story":"Liverpool, runners-up in the Champions League last season, will be in pot three in Thursday afternoon’s group-stage draw after Benfica saw off Paok Thessaloniki in the play-offs.Had Benfica lost then Liverpool would have joined Manchester United and Tottenham in pot two.

He will take up the space filled in Russia by the experienced Gary Cahill, who announced this week he wished to take a “step back” from England commitments as he seeks to regain a place in Chelsea’s lineup.“We’re obviously coming off the back of a successful summer, so I think there’s a good foundation for us to build on,” Southgate said. “With us only being three games into the season, I felt some continuity was important so those who were with us in the summer deserve the right to go again. Others haven’t really had the opportunity to force themselves ahead of those guys.“From here we have a two-year lead into the European Championship, so I want us to try to capture what we had this summer and why they felt it went well – but, once we’re through this camp, there’s going to be competition from others. People are going to have to play at a good level to retain their places.”Regarding players such as Manchester City’s Foden, Fulham’s Sessegnon and Sancho of Borussia Dortmund, Southgate said: “We had five changes anyway and we felt that was enough. We also won’t stand still. Luke Shaw is still only 23, Joe Gomez is 21 so we have lowered the age again. We are aware of the excitement around other young players but it might be a bit too early for some.”The defender Phil Jones has missed out through injury after limping away from Manchester United’s defeat by Spurs. Burnley’s Tarkowski, on standby in the summer, is his replacement.The England manager has not used Jamie Vardy’s retirement, as revealed by the  on Tuesday, to name another striker in the squad. Danny Welbeck has kept his place, as has Ruben Loftus-Cheek, despite limited game time for their clubs.Southampton’s Alex McCarthy has stepped in for Nick Pope, a long-term absentee after dislocating a shoulder in Burnley’s Europa League qualifier at Aberdeen. The manager and his assistant, Steve Holland, watched McCarthy’s games against Everton and Leicester. The goalkeeper, uncapped but called up by Roy Hodgson in 2013 and Sam Allardyce in 2016, has earned a recall ahead of Joe Hart, who is gaining regular playing time after moving to Burnley.

But for services to the field of unnecessarily inflammatory quotation, deliberately incendiary riffing and consequence‑disregarding button‑pressing, Mou is the spiritual love child of Mahatma Gandhi and bed-in era John Lennon when compared with Bob Lord.On Sunday, Mourinho takes his side to Burnley, Lord’s old fiefdom, for a fixture that 60 years ago sparked wild scenes. In 1958, Lord, a wholesale butcher, was midway through the process of turning Burnley into one of the most successful clubs in the country. As chairman, he oversaw the construction of a modern training ground, implemented a successful youth development programme and appointed Harry Potts as manager. Potts would lead Burnley to the title in 1960, while Lord would go on to commission a couple of shiny stands at Turf Moor, both opened by his pal Edward Heath. An admirable body of work Lord was an extraordinary man.But his intense focus sometimes led to his missing the bigger picture. Quite literally when he made the myopic decision to chase the BBC cameras away during the 60s, when Match of the Day was busy turning players into stars and local clubs into nationally beloved institutions. That decision was mainly based on a misreading of the eternal importance of gate receipts, though Lord – a bluff, tell-it-as-I-see-it Lancastrian straight from central casting – was also wary of “a move to get soccer on the cheap by the Jews who run TV”.That observation caused a mass walkout from the Variety Club dinner at which he was the guest of honour. Small mercies but at least he apologised later. No such mea culpa was forthcoming before Burnley’s match against United in March 1958, which in retrospect was always going to kick off thanks to Lord’s old-school approach to grief management. Following the Munich tragedy, the world of football had rallied round. Liverpool were straight on the phone offering help Aston Villa’s manager Eric Houghton drove Stan Crowther to Old Trafford and insisted his striker sign to ease the crisis. But when United inquired about the possible purchase of Burnley’s winger Brian Pilkington and striker Albert Cheesebrough, Lord’s response was short and not altogether sweet.“I am just sick and tired of the whole business,” he boomed, 10 days after the disaster. “United may be in a jam but if they think they are coming to Burnley to pick roses off the tree, they better have second thoughts. When clubs offered to help it was with players sufficient to keep them ticking over, not to supply them with the cream of the country’s footballers. They’ll just have to fight their way out of it. They went into this of their own accord.”Little surprise that when United rocked up at Turf Moor, they were ready to roll. Mark Pearson, the young left‑back, was sent packing for scything down the Burnley striker Les Shannon. Crowther picked up a booking, then went in for a finisher on the put-upon Shannon and was extremely lucky not to walk too. Harry Gregg responded to a penalty-area scramble by adopting a boxer’s stance and threatening to warm Alan Shackleton’s lugs Shackleton fell backwards in surprise and was pinned to the floor by the fuming keeper.At one point United’s stand-in manager, Jimmy Murphy, refused to return the ball from the dugout and was accordingly reprimanded by the referee. After the match he stormed into the Burnley dressing room to trade ideas and opinions with Shannon over a tackle on Bobby Charlton. Drinks sent to the United dressing room came whistling back in the saloon-bar style. Incidentally, the score was 3-0 to Burnley.Lord doubled down on his earlier pronouncements, accusing United of “running around like Teddy Boys. It looks as if they don’t like losing. If United continue to play like this, they’ll lose the sympathy the public have for them”. Murphy pointed out that defeat was not really the issue, as they had been expecting to lose every match after the crash anyway. Aggrieved, he described Lord’s views as “shocking and disgraceful”.The United-minded were in lockstep: the famous Times correspondent Geoffrey Green, who had fallen hard for the Babes and would later pen United’s official centenary history, delivered his verdict: “Matt Busby once said: ‘I aim to make footballers of my boys.’ They had better remember that … or tarnish a fine name. There is a limit to sympathy.”Eye-opening analysis by today’s mores. Post‑traumatic stress was almost certainly an issue Gregg, only 37 days before his donnybrook with Shackleton, was saving lives on the Munich runway. Then again, this was only 13 years after the second world war and generations had become inured to tragedy, the widespread loss of young life and the harsh necessity of carrying on regardless. In that context, Lord’s comments are perhaps easier to understand if not necessarily forgive.

It’s been a long time since I was part of an awards show like this. “I was very lucky to play with some of the biggest clubs, best players and greatest managers. Winning the treble was a great moment for me – it was a moment we created history.

Now posties have a new tool at their disposal‘This one will bite the letters and head butt the door,” smiles Charlie, a postal worker I am shadowing on his rounds. He slides a\u0026nbspcatalogue halfway inside the letterbox of a green door, and it is instantly snatched by jaws unseen. I\u0026nbspcan tell by the sound that there is drool on the carpet. “Good boy!” I\u0026nbspwhisper through the door.I am here to learn about the threat\u0026nbspof dogs to postal staff, as part of Royal Mail’s annual drive to raise awareness. Yet not only is my blindly\u0026nbsppro-dog prejudice part of the\u0026nbspproblem, I am too excited to learn anything. I have always been fascinated by the post, with its nostalgic link to national services – even after privatisation, the company has kept its government charter, the universal service obligation to deliver to 30m addresses for the same price.More than that, though, I am fascinated by the business of being a\u0026nbspcheeky postal worker. It is an alternative career I always wondered about. Now I am actually on a round, I can’t stop asking Charlie questions. What’s the most annoying thing to deliver? (The Harrods catalogue: too\u0026nbspthick.) Does he ignore signs that say “No junk mail please”? (Yes: it’s\u0026nbspnot his job to decide what is junk\u0026nbspmail or not.) What do his regulars say to him every day? (“One\u0026nbspof them says: ‘Morning Postman Pat, where’s your black and\u0026nbspwhite cat?”)Such a wholesome life, I think, picturing myself with the red bag, the red top, the company trainers with a red stripe on the tongue. On a nearby patch of grass, I see a handsome boxer, squatting. I beckon the good boy over and we fraternise. “That’s actually against the guidelines,” says Henry Perry, external relations manager for Royal Mail, who is also with us. In dog safety recommendations for staff, the company uses the acronym Avoid, in which the “A” stands for … well, avoid. (The others are Defend, Inform, Observe and Value Yourself, that latter of which sounds quite spiritual, but basically means don’t enter a garden with an unchained cockapoo in it.)Meeting dogs is one of the top five reasons I like to imagine being a postal worker. Isn’t the eternal rivalry between pooch and postie cute? Somehow very British?“This Dennis the Menace idea, that a dog hanging off the seat of your pants is an occupational hazard – I have a problem with that,” says Shaun Davis, global safety director at Royal Mail. “It’s like saying: ‘If you don’t want to get held up by a bank robber, don’t work in a bank.’” It turns out that dog attacks are one of the top five threats to postal staff. Fingers and thumbs have been bitten off, even a nose. Injuries to calves, buttocks and testicles are common. In 2017, there were more than six attacks a day. It’s a country-wide problem: last year, Sheffield saw the highest number of incidents, this year it was Taunton. As Davis describes the life-changing injuries that mean some postal staff are unable to return to their routes, and\u0026nbsprequire much mental health support afterwards, I realise that I\u0026nbsphave been naive.“I don’t use postal pegs they can’t\u0026nbsptake any weight,” says Charlie, dismissing the tongs staff are encouraged to use to deliver mail through letterboxes. Perry looks sad, because this is not a very on-message thing to say. (Thirteen per cent of dog attacks on postal staff\u0026nbspare of the fingers-in-letterbox variety.)Charlie is exactly what I like to imagine postal workers are like: an unnaturally fast mover, nipping over walls, earbuds hanging over one ear, trying to beat his personal best time for the round. Posties talk a bit like rappers: I ask Charlie where he is from, and he replies: “W7, but we’re in W12 now.” At just 20, he is one of the youngest in the game and, by his\u0026nbspcalculation, won’t see a good (ie\u0026nbspeasy) route until he is 40. He is also the least concerned person I have ever met. Inside a terrifying death-trap lift on an estate, he mildly observes that it often breaks down. He steps into the road the way\u0026nbspAchilles stepped into battle. “If\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspwaited, nothing would get delivered,” he says over his shoulder as a Ford Focus supplicates before him. Is he concerned about dog bites? He smiles, which I take to mean he is not.“The ‘young and invincible’ mindset is one of our challenges,” acknowledges Davis. It is why the company has developed a new virtual reality experience, to teach its frontline employees Avoid strategies. It is short and interactive, to better engage staff, who will have been pulled off the sorting floor for the training. I have a go myself later, at Royal Mail’s head office, in a swivel chair with a VR headset on. It’s fun – you get to follow a new postal worker, Mel, on her round, looking for signs of dogs and advising her what to do. I stare at poos hidden in the virtual garden, urine-faded grass, hung up leads and cutesy warning notices, while the program registers that I have clocked them. Occasionally, I misdirect Mel: telling her to feed a begging terrier, or not to bother reporting a new dog on her walk log. Then I am called into the office and reprimanded by a virtual manager. Royal Mail’s dog-awareness campaign has been a success. It’s not anti-dog it simply advocates for responsible dog ownership, and the\u0026nbsppublic have responded. Simple tips – such as securing excitable dogs\u0026nbspin other rooms at delivery hour,\u0026nbspand fitting letterbox cages or external post boxes, have halved the\u0026nbsp5,000 annual dog attacks of just five years ago. Approaching the end of the round, which I have slowed down immeasurably, I figure the time is now. Swallowing nervously, I ask if I\u0026nbspcan put one in.“Put one … what in?” asks Charlie, breaking stride for the first time. I\u0026nbspexplain that one of my lifelong ambitions has been to become a postie and deliver the mail. Charlie shrugs and hands me a bundle.“That’s definitely against USO guidelines,” Perry shouts, but he’s too far behind, and too late. It’s happening. I shove in a Boden catalogue, a penalty charge notification and some final demands. It’s a little underwhelming, to be honest. Post has got less interesting since the internet. Still, it\u0026nbspis satisfying to tick off the bucket list now all I need is to try becoming a town crier, and go hang-gliding. And get a dog."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99a9e826aeffec849c36e11947a87090c950641/0_275_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99599bdbb96e77c30df1c18375c002f5","title":"paw outcome new zealand council proposes banning all cats","story":"Under ‘pest plan’ Omaui residents will not be allowed to replace cats when they dieA regional council in New Zealand has proposed banning all domestic cats in an attempt to protect native animals.Environment Southland’s “pest plan” calls for all domestic cats in the region to be neutered, microchipped and registered. Then, when a cat dies, residents would not be permitted to have another.“We’re not cat haters,” John Collins, of the Omaui Landcare Trust told Newshub. “But we’d like to see responsible pet ownership and this really isn’t the place for cats.”Ali Meade, the council’s biosecurity operations manager, said that if the move was approved the improvement for the environment and bird life would be vast.Submissions on the pest management plan close at the end of October. However, not all members of the community are happy with the idea.Omaui resident Nico Jarvis told the Otago Daily Times that she was shocked and planned a petition against the plan. She said that her three cats were the only way to combat a rodent problem in the area. “If I cannot have a cat, it almost becomes unhealthy for me to live in my house,” she said.Jarvis likened the plan to living in a “police state … It’s not even regulating people’s ability to have a cat. It’s saying you can’t have a cat.”The move comes as New Zealand works on an ambitious goal to become predator-free by 2050. That plan is devoted to wiping out introduced species of rats, stoats and possums.The plan, announced in 2016, says that the government estimates the cost of introduced species to the New Zealand economy and primary sector to be NZ$3.3bn (£1.76bn) a year.Cats have also come under the spotlight for their tendency to target native birds.Kapiti Island’s Kotuku Parks subision has a no-cat rule and Auckland council is also looking at a plan to euthanise any cat caught in an “ecologically significant site” without a microchip.Economist turned parliamentary candidate Gareth Morgan has long proposed wiping out cats from New Zealand as a way to protect native species from what he called “natural born killers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7372a4da0b37fa476bf8ba95be4059324303a64/0_104_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72cb317a9772c927a051a74108cca961","title":"the rock star whisperer how one woman helps a list musicians survive","story":"Kathryn Frazier spent much of her career raising the profiles of clients like Justin Bieber and Miguel through publicity but now as a life coach she also helps them stay on an even keelIn the last 15 months, the suicides of Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington and Avicii have reinforced the notion that talent, success, wealth and worldwide fame do not assure happiness. In the wake of these deaths, mental health in the music industry has become a white-hot issue, with a genre-ning collection of artists coming forth to discuss their own struggles with depression, anxiety, addiction and the pressures of fame.And while her job has long been to help artists achieve such fame, Kathryn Frazier has more recently become a resource for them to figure out how to deal with it.Frazier, the founder and owner of the PR agency Biz3 – which has offices in Chicago and Los Angeles – has raised the profiles of hundreds of clients including Lauryn Hill, Miguel, Daft Punk, Justin Bieber, Skrillex and Migos. After 26 years in the business, Frazier has now expanded her professional offerings by becoming a certified personal and executive coach, a title often simple referred to as “life coach”.Frazier works in both coaching and mentorshipadvising capacities, doing sessions via Skype with clients in other countries and those out on tour. While she once scoffed at the idea of life coaching, she now evangelizes its efficacy – which she emphasizes is very different from traditional therapy – and is in the process of getting certified in relationship and addiction coaching. Altogether, she’s establishing herself as a resource for musicians looking to transcend the struggling rock star stereotype.Do you think people, and especially musicians, are now more in need of the kind of services you provide, or are we now just more aware that people are struggling?It was just sort of like, “well, artists party”, or “artists are crazy” or” artists are just so in their heads”. People writing it off like it’s a stereotype. There’s probably some truth to that, but for me it was not wanting to keep helping these people get more famous – because that is what my job is, to make artists get well known and help people know who they are – then watching them struggle and be held down by it.I do think people have certainly always needed the help. You go back to Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix. The list is long with people that probably needed a lot of help and maybe they got it, but couldn’t accept it. We have for a long time been watching our rock stars kill themselves. Of course, there’s a story behind every one of those, and some maybe had enablers. Some probably had some people really trying to help. But I think as a whole, we expect rock stars to be tragic and difficult. I don’t think it has to be that way.Do you find that artists have a typical set of issues they’re bringing to sessions that sets them apart from other clients who aren’t in the music industry?A common thing is that there’s a frustration – or they’re perplexed – that they achieved a bunch of things they wanted, yet they still feel judgmental and still have a lot of negative self-talk. They still compare and despair. They still have the same problems they had when they were trying to make it, and now you add in they’re kind of resentful … there’s a lot of people feeling like they take care of everyone. I hear frustration that they feel like they’re not – they don’t use the term “yes men” – but they want to be heard more and challenged a bit.Across the board, whether it’s an artist or a manager or the CEO of a media company or a college kid, a very common thing that comes up is this negative self-talk. A rock star might report as much negative self-talk as, like, a struggling college kid. I do a lot of very discounted or trade coaching for people who I think need it, because I feel like karmically I need to help support people who don’t have the means to have a coach or have therapy, because that’s a luxury. So I get the beauty of seeing these really different lives and it’s just so funny to see the lady that I’m coaching in Santa Monica who wants to have a mega church has the same issues and struggles as a well-known rapper living in the Hollywood Hills.You’ve seen the rise of social media during your career. Obviously it affects us all to a certain extent, but artists deal with such massive exposure. What effect is it having on them?We think people in positions of power are somehow above everyone else and free from the self-torture and negative self-talk, but they’re not any different than we are. They just have a lot more critics. It’s painful, and it’s actually really sad to watch. I’ve definitely had coaching sessions around how artists can use Instagram to their advantage, but also protect themselves.Are you seeing the results of your coaching on a mass level, where an artist puts out a project and you can sense the changes they’ve made through the music?There are two artists in particular that I have a good either coaching or this kind of advisingmentoring relationship with. The more they’re growing, the more their music is consistent with their thoughts. There’s a natural shift that’s going to happen, because if they’re being authentic to themselves and their mind state is shifting, of course they’re going to grow and shift.That’s what’s beautiful about artists, especially artists who’ve been around a long time. We can go back through many artists’ records and like, “This is a record where they got destroyed and had their heart broken. This is the record where they were angry and where they were funny and took everybody down. This is the record where they got spiritual.” You can see people’s growth.I imagine this work brings artists to a deeper level of their artistry.I feel like if we’re deeper and at better places as humans, we’re going to be better at our work. I just don’t see how there’s any way around that. I feel like we gawk at artists too much. We watch them be classic, messed up, wounded, depressed, hurt artists, because that’s what they’re supposed to do and we’re so into their music because it helps us tap into our stuff and to feel. But we’ve also gotta throw the life preserver out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9a25441d9173f1b312aa729f595dd703b2042c3/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a3f54911f72e811995a08b4d7d3c6e","title":"how the us fracking boom almost fell apart","story":"The wild tale of America’s energy revolution, and the cowboy who made and lost billions on shale. By  Bethany McLeanThis remarkable transformation was brought about by American entrepreneurs who figured out how to literally force open rocks often more than a mile below the surface of the earth, to produce gas, and then oil. Those rocks – called shale, source rock or tight rock, and once thought to be impermeable – were opened by combining two technologies: horizontal drilling, in which the drill bit can travel more than two miles horizontally, and hydraulic fracturing, in which fluid is pumped into the earth at a high enough pressure to crack open hydrocarbon-bearing rocks, while a so-called proppant, usually sand, holds the rocks open a sliver of an inch so the hydrocarbons can flow. A fracking entrepreneur likens the process to creating hallways in an office building that has none – and then calling a fire drill.In November 2017, US production topped the 10m barrel-a-day record set in 1970, back in the last gasp of the legendary oil boom. This year, it is expected to reach almost 11m barrels a day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The Marcellus Shale, which stretches through northern Appalachia, could be the second-largest natural gas field in the world, according to geologists at Penn State. Shale gas now accounts for more than half of total US production, according to the EIA, up from almost nothing a decade ago.The apparent new era of American energy abundance has already had a profound impact around the world. Economies that were dependent on the high price of oil, from Russia to Saudi Arabia, have begun to struggle. The situation would have been unthinkable in the pre-2014 world of $100-a-barrel oil, and is playing out in strange and unpredictable ways.Since the 1970s, US presidents from Gerald Ford to both Bushes emphasised the importance of “energy independence”, although the country had in fact become more and more dependent, particularly on the Middle East. Under the Trump administration, the longstanding dream of America’s energy independence has taken a grander, more muscular turn. Secretary of the interior Ryan Zinke talks about opening more federal lands, including national parks, to drilling in order to ensure “energy dominance”.“We’ve got underneath us more oil than anybody, and nobody knew it until five years ago,” Trump told the press aboard Air Force One in the summer of 2017. “And I want to use it. And I don’t want that taken away by the Paris accord. I don’t want them to say all of that wealth that the United States has under its feet, but that China doesn’t have and that other countries don’t have, we can’t use.”But the shale success story nearly became a disaster. While to date, most of the complaints about fracking have focused on environmental concerns, there’s a bigger and far less well known reason to doubt the most breathless predictions about America’s future as an oil and gas giant. The fracking of oil, in particular, rests on a financial foundation that is far less secure than most people realise.Because so few fracking companies actually make money, the most vital ingredient in fracking isn’t chemicals, but capital, with companies relying on Wall Street’s willingness to fund them. If it weren’t for historically low interest rates, it’s not clear there would even have been a fracking boom at all.‘You can make an argument that the Federal Reserve is entirely responsible for the fracking boom,” one private-equity titan told me. That view is echoed by Amir Azar, a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “The real catalyst of the shale revolution was the 2008 financial crisis and the era of unprecedentedly low interest rates it ushered in,” he wrote in a recent report. Another investor put it this way: “If companies were forced to live within the cash flow they produce, US oil would not be a factor in the rest of the world, and would have grown at a quarter to half the rate that it has.”Worries about the financial fragility of the fracking revolution have simmered for some time. John Hempton, who runs the Australia-based hedge fund Bronte Capital, recalls having debates with his partner as the boom was just getting going. “The oil and gas are real,” his partner would say. “Yes,” Hempton would respond, “but the economics don’t work.”Thus far, the fracking industry has been more resilient than anyone would have dreamed. But questions about the sustainability of the boom are no longer limited to a small set of skeptics. Those doubts now extend to the boardrooms of some big investors, as well as to the executive suites of at least a few of the fracking companies themselves. The fracking boom has been fuelled mostly by overheated investment capital, not by cash flow.If the story of the fracking boom has a central character, it’s Aubrey McClendon, the founder of Chesapeake Energy, a startup that grew into a colossus. For a brief moment in history, he most represented US fracking to the world. No one was more right and more wrong, no one bolder in his predictions or more spectacular in his failures, no one more willing to risk other people’s money and his own, than McClendon or, as one banker who knew McClendon well put it: “The world moves when people who like risk take action.”“He was the good face of the industry – the passion, the creativity, the daring,” another former investment banker told me. “But he was also the bad face.” And that duality makes him a perfect personification of the US fracking revolution.In the fall of 2008, Forbes had ranked McClendon No 134 on its list of the 400 richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of more than $3bn. But because he borrowed so much money and secured business loans with personal guarantees, lawyers were still wrangling over the remains of his estate two years after his death, trying to figure out which debts would be paid – from the $500,000 he owed the Boy Scouts of America to the $465m he owed a group of Wall Street creditors, including Goldman Sachs. Wall Street’s vultures – the hedge funds that invest in distressed debt – had descended, buying the debt for less than 50 cents on the dollar, essentially rendering a judgment that the claims wouldn’t be paid in full. If McClendon did die broke, it wouldn’t have been out of character. During his years as an oil and gas tycoon, he fed on risk, and was as fearless as he was reckless. He built an empire that at one point produced more gas than any American company except ExxonMobil. Once, when an investor asked on a conference call, “When is enough?”, McClendon answered bluntly: “I can’t get enough.”Many think that without McClendon’s salesmanship and his astonishing ability to woo investors, the world would be a far different place today. Stories abound about how, at industry conferences, executives from oil majors like Exxon would find themselves speaking to mostly empty seats, while people literally fought for space in the room where McClendon was holding forth. “In retrospect, it was kind of like Camelot,” said Henry Hood, Chesapeake’s former general counsel, who worked at the company, initially as a consultant, from 1993 until the spring of 2013. “There was a period of time that will never be duplicated, with a company that will never be duplicated.”“America’s Most Reckless Billionaire,” Forbes once called McClendon, and for many in the industry, that headline defined the man. But if it was a con, he was conning himself, too. Because he believed. He was, in many ways, the embodiment of a transformation that has changed the face of not just the oil and gas industries, but of geopolitics as well.In the darkest days of the collapse of oil prices in the mid-1980s, McClendon, as ever undeterred, saw an opportunity in assembling packages of drilling rights – for gas, not oil – either to be sold to bigger companies or to be drilled. In the mere existence of that opportunity, America is almost unique, because it is one of the few countries where private citizens, rather than governments, own the mineral rights under their properties. In order to drill, you just have to persuade someone to give you a lease. McClendon became what’s known in the oil and gas business as a “land man” – the person who negotiates the leases that allow for drilling. That, it turned out, would make him the perfect person for the new world of fracking, which is not so much about finding the single gusher as it is about assembling the rights to drill multiple wells. “Landmen were always the stepchild of the industry,” he later told Rolling Stone. “Geologists and engineers were the important guys – but it dawned on me pretty early that all their fancy ideas aren’t worth very much if we don’t have a lease. If you’ve got the lease and I don’t, you win.”In 1983, when McClendon was just 24 years old, he went into partnership with another Oklahoman named Tom Ward, “doing deals for scraps of land in Oklahoma, faxing each other in the middle of the night,” Ward said to Rolling Stone. Six years later, the two formed Chesapeake Energy, which was named after the beloved bay where McClendon’s family vacationed. They seeded it with a $50,000 investment.Neither Ward nor McClendon were technological pioneers. That distinction, most people agree, goes to a man named George Mitchell, who drew on research done by the government to experiment on the Barnett Shale, an area of tight rock in the Fort Worth basin of North Texas. Using a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, Mitchell’s team cracked the code for getting gas out of rock that was thought to be impermeable.“As oxygen is to life, capital is to the oil and gas business,” said Andrew Wilmot, a Dallas-based mergers and acquisitions adviser to the oil and gas industry at Purposed Ventures. “This industry needs capital to fire on all cylinders, and the founder and father of raising capital for shale in the US is Aubrey McClendon.”“To be able to borrow money for 10 years and ride out boom-and-bust cycles was almost as important an insight as horizontal drilling,” McClendon, with typical immodesty, said to Rolling Stone.On 12 February 1993 – a day McClendon would later describe as the best of his career – he and Ward took Chesapeake public. They did so despite the fact that their accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, had issued a “going concern” warning, meaning its bean-counters worried that Chesapeake might go out of business. So McClendon and Ward simply switched accounting firms. “Tom and I were 33-year-old landmen at the time, and most people didn’t think we had a clue what we were doing, and probably in hindsight they were at least partially right,” McClendon told an interviewer in 2006.In the decade before 2004, Chesapeake spent around $6bn acquiring properties, companies and leases. McClendon, who would later call these years the “the great North American land grab”, developed a reputation among his peers for overpaying. His aggressiveness didn’t endear him to the old-time oil men. “Everyone in Midland hated Chesapeake,” one said. “They came out here when land was leasing for $200-$300 an acre. All of a sudden, Chesapeake was paying $2,000-$3,000. They got in some good places because they shut everyone else out. Their attitude was: ‘We are Chesapeake, get out of our way.’”McClendon went on a corporate spending spree that would have put today’s Silicon Valley chieftains to shame. “Asking me what to do with extra cash is like asking a fraternity boy what to do with the beer,” McClendon told Natural Gas Intelligence in 2005. Nor was he frugal when it came to his personal life. He acquired multimillion-dollar mansions and resorts in Oklahoma, Bermuda, Maui, Vail, on Lake Michigan, and even in Minnesota. He had one of the best wine collections in the world.To Wall Street investors, McClendon was delivering on what they wanted most: consistency and growth. His pitch was that fracking had transformed the production of gas from a hit-or-miss proposition to one that operated with an on and off switch. It was manufacturing, not wildcatting. He became a flag-waver for natural gas – “Mr Gas”, as Fortune magazine once called him.“Aubrey was the first one to say, ‘Let’s create demand,’” Chesapeake’s Henry Hood said.Back in 2003, when McClendon was just getting started, the consensus view had been that the US was running out of natural gas. It became a fixation for Alan Green, the once-revered chair of the Federal Reserve, who warned Congress during a rare appearance that the shortage and rising cost of gas could hurt the American economy. Green recommended that the US build terminals to accept deliveries of liquefied natural gas from other countries. “We see a storm brewing on the horizon,” said Billy Tauzin, a Republican representative from Louisiana and the then-chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Such fears eventually helped push through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempted natural gas drillers from having to disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, thus averting costly regulatory oversight.McClendon’s bullish view on prices became the conventional wisdom in energy markets. In 2007, the supposedly smartest investors in the world – among them Goldman Sachs and the takeover titan KKR – structured their massive $45bn buyout of a utility called TXU in a way that was essentially a bet that natural gas prices, then around $7, were set to rise significantly.At the same time, Vladimir Putin was making similar bets. In an attempt to set up a cartel for gas, the Russian premier hosted a group of gas-producing countries, including Algeria, Iran, and Venezuela, in Moscow. The US was not among them. “Costs of exploration, gas production and transportation are going up,” Putin said. “It means the industry’s development costs will skyrocket. The time of cheap energy resources, cheap gas, is surely coming to an end.”When the going got rough, McClendon had always survived by borrowing yet more money to acquire more properties. “Simply put, low prices cure low prices as consumers are motivated to consume more and producers are compelled to produce less,” he wrote in Chesapeake’s 1998 annual report. But he had forgotten the flipside of that industry truism. Time and again, in commodity markets, high prices encourage more producers to produce, creating a surplus, that then crushes prices – and producers. “He was right that shale changed the world,” said one longtime gas man. “He should have listened to himself.”The price of natural gas began to plunge in 2012, and in 2014, the price of oil followed suit. Falling prices quickly exposed the weak underbelly of US shale – its high costs and ravenous need for capital. Once-booming US production hit the skids. The so-called rig count – the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas at a given time – fell from 1,920 rigs in late 2014 to a low of 480 in early 2016. “We think it likely that to find a lower level of activity would require going back to the 1860s, the early part of the Pennsylvania oil boom,” Paul Hornsell, head of commodities research for Standard Chartered bank, wrote in a research note. By mid-2016, US oil production had declined by 1m barrels a day.One after another, debt-laden companies began to declare bankruptcy, with some 200 of them eventually going bust. In a report released in the fall of 2016, credit rating agency Moody’s called the corporate casualties “catastrophic”. “When all the data is in, including 2016 bankruptcies, it may very well turn out that this oil and gas industry crisis has created a segment-wide bust of historic proportions,” said David Keisman, a Moody’s senior vice-president.Some of those who had bought assets from McClendon and others in the heyday also began to write down the value of what they had purchased. Statoil, the Norwegian energy giant, wrote down the value of its shale and Canadian oil sands assets by $4bn Royal Dutch Shell reported a write-down of more than $8bn. Most prominent was Australia’s BHP Billiton, which had spent $5bn investing with Chesapeake in the Fayetteville shale and ploughed another $15bn into the purchase of Houston-based Petrohawk. BHP put all the assets on the block in the fall of 2014, but found no buyers, and eventually wrote off more than $7bn – which begat the phrase “pulling a BHP”.As one investor put it: “All of the acquisitions of shale assets done by the majors and by international companies have been disasters. The wildcatters made a lot of money, but the companies haven’t.”The shale boom towns suddenly resembled their California counterparts after the gold rush. In the Cline shale east of Midland in Texas, Devon Energy decreased its rig activity and let its leases expire, citing “a lot of variability” in the formation. In the town of Sweetwater, “ambitions are fading fast as the plummeting price of oil causes investors to pull back, cutting off the projects that were supposed to pay for a bright new future,” wrote the Associated Press in early 2015. “Now the town of 11,000 awaits layoffs and budget cuts and defers its dreams.”Surveying the carnage in the spring of 2016, then ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told a gathering of analysts that due to the huge amount of debt most companies in the industry had accumulated, he couldn’t even find anything worth buying.When Aubrey McClendon died in his car, colliding with a concrete wall supporting an overpass at 90mph, it was hard not to see his death as the punctuation marking the end of an era. As the Australian hedge fund manager John Hempton asked: “Is Chesapeake the model for this business? It changes the world, but it ends in tears?”  This is an edited extract from Saudi America by Bethany McLean, which will be published by Columbia Global Reports on 12 September.

But Friday’s joint parliamentary meeting, to be held at Napier University in Edinburgh, is certain to be dominated by one topic.Alex Salmond’s dramatic resignation from the SNP, the party he led across three decades, turning it into a powerful electoral force and coming close to delivering a yes vote to independence in 2014, is the latest shockwave to hit Scotland’s governing party.A week after the former first minister launched an unprecedented judicial review of the Scottish government’s handling of two sexual misconduct complaints made against him, it is hard to avoid talk of a major split within the party as well as potentially seismic repercussions for the pro-independence movement itself.Observers of every stripe acknowledge Salmond’s continuing capacity to direct the news agenda with his usual hyperbolic flourish, but many also express deep regret that the discussion has already moved so far from where it began: two women’s allegations that he sexually harassed them while he was first minister, complaints that have now been referred to the police.In his resignation statement, which Salmond released alongside a crowdfunding appeal to support his legal action, he insisted that he was “conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal ision”.Beyond the retweeting of either Salmond or Nicola Sturgeon’s statements on the matter, it is notable how quiet SNP MPs and MSPs – well known for their embrace of the platform – have been on social media since the revelations first emerged.But the fact that a man with his evident resources was still able to reach his £50,000 target within hours of launching the appeal is evidence of the loyalty Salmond commands, among senior figures but also rank and file party members and across the wider yes movement – and of how speedily he can mobilise it. His successor may contemplate this as she prepares to update Holyrood on her position regarding a second independence referendum this autumn – something Salmond has taken a less gradualist position on.On their public reticence, SNP parliamentarians will say privately that there is a collective willingness not to stoke the fire of speculation while investigations and legal actions are ongoing. This is helped by a pragmatic recognition that the party has achieved much more in recent years as a broadly unified party, as well as the personal esteem that Sturgeon is held in. But there are also those who underline the serious disquiet among some colleagues at what they consider to be a lack of due process in the handling of sexual harassment complaints – including those which led to the resignation from the party of former minister Mark McDonald in March – and a culture of leaking to the media.Affection for Salmond is by no means universal, but he is frequently characterised as a “rough diamond” or a “street-fighter”, even by those who insist he should not be above the law.And there are those who insist that the spotlight must return to women. One prominent Scottish feminist Claire Heuchan questioned on Thursday morning how many people donating money to Salmond’s fighting fund had thought about how it would affect women who’ve been sexually assaulted, or how it might discourage women from coming forward in the future. Others noted that Salmond’s hashtag #forfairness appeared to imply that those bringing the complaints were somehow being underhand. Questions about the professional links of the husband of Leslie Evans, the country’s most senior civil servant, whose handling of the allegations Salmond is challenging, have left many women shaking their heads in despair about the progress of gender equality in Scottish public life. A consideration of the wider impact on female voters may well be crucial to the longer-term health of the independence movement. Throughout the Scottish independence campaign, much time was spent analysing why many women were unconvinced by the yes message, and how best to win them over. Groups like Women for Independence heard from women who said they were turned off by a largely male-dominated debate. As national coordinator Margaret Young told the  earlier this year: “What we found was not that women were risk-averse but that they didn’t believe there would be any change with independence because it would still be about people, mainly men, shouting and point-scoring whether in the newspaper, on television or on social media.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de0ae20513bed42f5c59d0bf014c832c271787d1/144_195_7752_4651/master/7752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aeca329114f955fe2fdcc8819cc1ef6","title":"calm down barniers words were not a brexit deal green light","story":"The EU negotiator’s remarks about an unprecedented partnership were nothing newThe flurry of excitement in national newspaper newsrooms and on the trading floors on Wednesday illustrated one thing: the Brexit summer holiday is over, and with negotiations at the squeaky-bum end of the process, the slightest indication of where this is all going to end up will be seized upon, make headlines and move markets. But it is worth looking at some facts – not always the highest-value commodity in the Brexit debate.Traders interpreted this to be an opening to Theresa May’s Chequers proposals, under which the UK would benefit from something akin to single market access for its traders in agricultural and industrial goods, and a friction-free customs border. But Barnier last uttered these words on 2 August during a press conference in Brussels in which he forensically tore apart the prime minister’s white paper, warning that its ideas on a new customs arrangement and trade in goods represented a threat to the integrity of the EU.Handily, Barnier himself explained a little better in an interview aired on Thursday with the German radio station Deutschlandfunk. “We have been willing to form a strong relationship from the beginning,” Barnier told the station. “Twenty-seven heads of state and government, including Angela Merkel and the French president and other heads of state, have proposed a unique partnership with the United Kingdom.”The deal was, he said, unprecedented in that it went further than mere agreement on tariff-free trade, taking in areas from “aviation to university and research cooperation, to internal and external security and foreign policy”. Barnier said of the EU’s offer: “It cannot be built to the detriment of who we are. The internal market, the home market, is indeed our most important asset ... We respect all the red lines of the United Kingdom. They do not want to abide by the rules of the court of justice, they do not want to follow our legal framework, they do not want to pay, they do not want freedom of movement. All of these are the cornerstones of the single market and the EU. So we have to preserve and protect what makes us.”The Chequers proposal is dead, the zombie white paper just doesn’t know it yet. So what to make of the suggestion in the Times (paywall) that because the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has a vision of a Europe of “concentric circles”, with the EU and the euro at its core and Britain in a second ring, there is reason to believe that Paris is softening to May’s proposals? The idea of a multi-speed Europe has done the rounds before. Macron raised it last September in a major speech outlining his plans for a “profound transformation” of Europe. But where does the UK really fit in? Again, handily, Macron gave a speech on Monday to French ambassadors gathered from around the world in which he spelled out what he actually thinks. It offered Downing Street little succour. Brexit, he said, was akin to the elevation of Donald Trump to the White House: an example of the “extremism” that prospers from the rage of those who feel they have lost to globalisation, and to which the French president has set himself in opposition. Of the deal that might be struck with the UK, the door to Chequers was firmly shut. “Brexit is a sovereign choice which must be respected, but it is a choice which cannot be made at the expense of the European Union’s integrity,” Macron told his diplomats. “It is what the British people have chosen for themselves, not for others, and France would like to maintain a strong, special relationship with London, but not at the cost of the European Union breaking up.”It was certainly London’s right to champion the benefits of Brexit, the French president said. That “is one thing ... but we have to defend the integrity of our values, of our foundations and of the European Union”. To echo the British prime minister’s words during her disastrous general election campaign, this time really nothing has changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2523745dbf4dbe81e71ed42f3e634621e15b66db/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14fe50a1fcc21c2596cfb53df28c6bc4","title":"jeremy hunt plays down brexit progress michel barnier poland","story":"Foreign secretary says Michel Barnier’s remarks do not show change to EU stance on UK planPoland’s nationalist government is seeking to persuade the EU to be more open to the UK’s Brexit plans as Jeremy Hunt said he had so far seen scant evidence of any hopeful movement from Brussels on the Chequers proposals.The British foreign secretary, meeting his EU counterparts in Vienna, downplayed any suggestion that recent comments from the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, offered any indication of a softening of the bloc’s resistance to the UK’s proposals.The value of the pound rose on Thursday after Barnier repeated his oft-stated hopes of a deal with the UK, interpreted by some as a sign that Brussels was responding to British lobbying in favour of a more generous deal on future trade.Hunt, however, offered a sceptical note on Thursday. “It’s going to be a very long, hard road ahead. Obviously, when there do appear to be signs of a change then that is encouraging, but I don’t think you can read too much into these,” he said.Austria’s foreign minister, Karin Kneissl, also dismissed the suggestion that the EU was ready to rethink its current position, which rules out key tenets of the Chequers proposals, including frictionless trade for goods across the Channel.“I think we still have to stick to the directives which were drafted in March 2017, namely the negotiating is all done by Michel Barnier. So when you speak of a more generous offer, it can only be within the marge de manoeuvre (room for manoeuvre) of Commissioner Barnier and his counterpart, the British government,” she said.The Polish foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, offered the British foreign secretary some hope, however, telling reporters that he would try to persuade his fellow ministers to shift their position, following an intense period of lobbying by British ministers in EU capitals in favour of the white paper on the future trading relationship.Asked whether a more generous deal could be offered by the EU, Czaputowicz, whose party has been in a long-running row with the European commission over the country’s judicial changes, and is facing unprecedented disciplinary action, told reporters: “I think that we have to discuss that issue. We are very pleased, Poland, that the white paper was presented. It is a good base for discussion.The struggle to get other member states onboard was nevertheless made clear by comments from other EU ministers in Vienna and Berlin, where Barnier was in talks with the German government.Annika Söder, the Swedish foreign secretary, suggested her central hope was that opinion on Brexit was changing in the UK in favour of a second referendum.“You know that we wanted to keep you and we look at the polls and we see that there may be some hesitation,” she said.“We hope that we can find a way forward to have a soft Brexit, because a hard Brexit wouldn’t serve anyone, but still – and this may be not very polite – we hope that there can be a solution where the UK will still be in the European Union.“Negotiations are important and Barnier and his team are working hard to find a good solution, so we will not give up on a soft Brexit, even if that tiny hope is still there.”The German economic affairs minister, Peter Altmaier, issued a statement following his meeting with Barnier reiterating Germany’s support for the EU negotiator and the guidelines offering the UK a free-trade deal, which Downing Street has already dismissed as lacking the necessary ambition to maintain economic prosperity on both sides of the Channel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/618cae7da05da9d36a3a84be1aed1599635c0bb5/9_6_2574_1544/master/2574.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9d385881449122b8843f809f91f56ae2 1000w","title":"sadiq khan bikini blimp to fly over central london","story":"Crowdfunding campaign raises more than £58,000 to help pay for balloon to highlight mayor’s record on crimeA blimp of Sadiq Khan wearing a yellow bikini is to fly over Westminster on Saturday morning in response to the Donald Trump baby balloon that the London mayor permitted in July.A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than £58,000 for the blimp, which references the bikini-clad “body-shaming” adverts Khan has vowed to ban on the tube. Organisers says they want to highlight the rise in violent crime in London this year.“In light of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon being allowed to fly over London during his visit to the UK, let’s get a ‘Baby Khan’ one and see if free speech applies to all and whether or not Mr Khan and the London assembly will also approve this.”Khan said: “If people want to spend their Saturday looking at me in a yellow bikini they’re welcome to do so. I don’t really think yellow’s my colour though.”By Thursday afternoon, more than 700 people had signed up to a Facebook event page calling for people to gather in Parliament Square to watch it, while about 4,800 indicated that they were “interested”.A city hall spokeswoman said the organisers of the blimp’s flight had been given permission to use Parliament Square Garden. “As always, city hall has been working in very close co-ordination with the politan police and other key agencies to ensure this protest is able to be carried out in a safe and secure way.”Trump supporters were infuriated when Khan allowed protesters to fly a blimp depicting the president as an orange-skinned baby clutching a mobile phone, in a nod to his outbursts on Twitter.Bruere’s blimp highlights Khan’s nose, and dresses him in a yellow bikini – a reference his 2016 call to ban “body-shaming” advertising on London’s transport network.

This was an uncomfortable compromise, absolutely, and it’s one of the reasons why I would love to get rid of this as quickly as possible – it is nasty and unfair.”Davey said the cabinet committee that made the final decision had been split, with one Conservative cabinet minister voting against the proposal. “I remember that moment so clearly I could not believe what some Tories were saying about immigration,” he said. “They were absolutely determined and they knew we were on the wrong side of public opinion.”Davey, whose party is set to propose stripping the Home Office of its responsibility for immigration policy, said the Windrush scandal and the wider debate about the future of immigration post-Brexit had shifted the debate.Ahead of its conference in Brighton this September, Davey said the party would propose a plan “a million miles away from a hostile environment, a million miles away from targets”.The policy paper on immigration is likely to draw criticism, however, because it does not address any form of post-Brexit immigration system or whether EU migrants should be given preferential treatment, because the party’s policy is to stop the UK from leaving the EU.The paper proposes taking away immigration policy from the Home Office’s remit, and instead iding the brief between departments.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would make policy on work permits, the Department for Education would oversee student visa policy, and the Department for International Development would make asylum policy.Assessment for visa and asylum applications would then be done by a separate agency, responsible to the Home Office, the paper proposes.“At the moment, the home secretary is under pressure the whole time from the tabloid media and certain parts of politics to stop immigration at all costs,” Davey said.“It permeates the whole administration of visas, of asylum applications. It creates perverse incentives, bad morale and a massive deskilling of people doing the work. The politics has changed the organisation dramatically.”The party would abolish the net migration target of 100,000, set under the coalition, which Davey said he had always opposed, as well as closing eight out of 10 detention centres, replacing them with detention in the community while cases are assessed.The MP, who won back his Kingston and Surbiton seat in June last year having lost to the Tories in 2015, admitted he had initially had concerns about a policy paper that did not address the future of immigration post-Brexit. Work had been started before he regained his seat, he said.“It’s a fair point to make,” he said. “I thought, why are we doing this now? But Brexit or no Brexit, the immigration system is broken.”Davey hints he is in favour of the preferential movement of EU citizens, should he have to really countenance the possibility that Brexit will happen. “The nearer you are to the status quo, the better,” he said.Senior Lib Dems have expressed concern in recent months that the party needs to broaden its reach beyond Brexit. The autumn conference is set to include radical overhauls of party structures, including giving non-MPs the chance to stand in leadership elections.The leader, Vince Cable, is due to make a major speech on 7 September, though he has denied rumours he is preparing to announce he will stand down.Davey said he was “really in favour of reform” of the party. “I think the party, unfortunately, while it has improved, is still too slow-moving, not engaging with members and supporters. We need to reach out to the public too, in a much broader way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ccf1943b5b7344bb826edcfdd3579f","title":"feline hungry an expert guide to feeding cats","story":"Your cat may act like it can look after itself but, like a teenager, it’s definitely underselling how much it needs you – especially when it comes to nutrition. Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

There’s no purrrfect answer, but the Celia Hammond Sanctuary manages to care for almost 300 if that’s a guide. Here’s how, plus an FAQ for every multi-cat householdThere is a place deep in the Sussex countryside where the four-legged residents reign supreme. They’re dozing in flowerpots, stretching in shady spots and exploring local woodlands at first glance, it seems like 100 acres of feline paradise. But the path to the Celia Hammond Rehoming Centre and Sanctuary has not been easy for the 120 cats who now roam free across the grounds, rescued as they were from often appalling conditions.“It all started during my modelling career, when a group of houses near us were threatened with demolition,” explains founder Celia Hammond, who graced the covers of Vogue during the 1960s. “There were cats inside, so obviously we had to do something. Some friends and I got some equipment together and saved them. Then people started calling me about other rescues, first every week and then every day, until it really started overtaking my work.”Celia first had the idea for a cat-friendly country house when she needed to move – accompanied by the rescue animals she had accumulated. It took her two years to find it: “We needed somewhere that was totally on its own. And then I found this place.”As the number of cats grew, Celia started looking for somewhere they could truly make themselves at home. Aptly known as Greenacres, the site took two years to find and includes stables, ancient and replanted woodland, a range of local wildlife including foxes and badgers, and (perhaps surprisingly) a wide variety of birds. At its heart is the 40-pen cattery, which currently holds around 150 cats waiting to become someone’s pet, and the main house, which live-in staff share with as many of the feral and semi-feral residents as want to join them – this central section is enclosed by a fence, designed to let cats through but keep other animals out.“The bulk of our work goes on in the rehoming centre,” explains Carolyn McBeath, the assistant manager at Greenacres. “That’s always our goal. It’s only when cats have multiple or chronic conditions and we haven’t been able to find the right place for them that they might get released into the sanctuary.” This is done slowly, first by housing a bonded group of cats in their own special “chalet” then setting them free once they’ve acclimatised.So what’s the secret to keeping the peace among this furry legion? “Primarily it’s only having cats here who are used to other cats, and using our intuition and expertise to know which ones will suit this environment,” says McBeath. “But another key consideration is space, so if they want to go off on their own and not see anyone they can. I think we all have days like that.” Neutering reduces their impulse to fight, and having adequate resources such as feeding stations, scratching posts and resting places ensures there’s nothing to fight over.There are those who believe cats are naturally solitary animals but, from its years of rescuing and rehoming family groups, the Celia Hammond Animal Trust has developed its own point of view. “All we can say is that our experience is very different,” says McBeath. “And while you can never generalise, we do find that most cats would like the opportunity of a mum or sibling playmate.”One such group is a young family brought in by their owner, who was facing eviction and unable to keep them. “The little ginger baby is just besotted with his dad and his dad is besotted with the mum, and they’re just so gregarious and happy and normal. We couldn’t split them up: we’re looking for a very special home that is able to love all three.”Clinical animal behaviourist Helen Greenley and Royal Canin scientific communications manager Vikki Anderson share their advice for a harmonious feline household.Are cats naturally sociable?“Research has found that cats will choose solitary or group living depending on availability of resources in their environment,” says Greenley. “In this way, the cat has become an amazingly adaptable and successful species – a sort of Bear Grylls among domestic animals.”How can I tell if my cats have bonded?“The group scent is the glue that bonds cats together and helps them feel relaxed in each other’s presence. This is transferred by touch against one another, so you may see them grooming or sleeping next to each other,” says Greenley. “Other affiliative behaviours include a chirruped greeting, bunting (bumping faces) and twining their tails together.”And how can I tell if they haven’t?“Non-bonded cats can live together in apparent harmony, but if you look closely, they do not display any of the scent-sharing behaviours. They have learned to tolerate each other – not ideal and can be a potential source of chronic, low level stress,” says Greenley.What’s the best way to manage feeding time?“It’s important to realise that in most group situations cats are not comfortable having to share water stations, food and litter trays, so it’s essential to have enough for each cat,” says Anderson. “It might be tempting to have their bowls in a neat row in the kitchen, but they should be an absolute minimum of one metre between them. Different rooms are even better.”What if one of my cats is eating all the food?“It can help to understand natural cat feeding patterns,” says Anderson. “They are natural grazers, eating lots of small meals throughout the day, but having multiple cats in the household can lead them to eat as much as possible in a sitting, leading to weight gain. To remedy this, activity feeders are great for encouraging cats’ natural grazing habits while meeting their need to play and hunt, making sure cats’ feeding stations are in low-traffic, possibly raised areas allows them to relax and eat their own food undisturbed.”Whether you’re the proud owner of a single pet or a burgeoning cattery, Royal Canin offers tailor-made breed-, age- and lifestyle-specific cat food, in wet and dry form, for optimum feline health.

Here’s what your cat’s age really means – and how to handle the changes that come with itOnce kittens pass the newborn phase, where they should be with their mothers, and begin to grow and engage with the outside world, they will discover play. Kitten play mimics moves that would be used for hunting such as stalking, ambushing and pawing. Help your kitten hone these skills, which also keep them active, by making time to play with them using age- and size-appropriate toys.TrainingToilet training should start using a size-appropriate litter tray as soon as your kitten comes home. Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat. For advice speak to your vet or consult a nutritional advice line such as Royal Canin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d2d44df3768c103aa3e2e2d53ddf8c0efb82fe/1087_420_2899_1740/master/2899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a28010abed1c7c64ca4d60ff2d8054ba","title":"premiership saracens exeter 2018 19","story":"The Strictly Come Dancing sequins and heels may be absent but in every other respect club rugby union is poised to strut its stuff. Rarely has a season offered such opportunity for those bold enough to reach out and seize it: a World Cup is on the horizon and a can-do attitude could yet transform the careers of players who put their best foot forward.What the English Premiership, now backed by the American insurance broker Gallagher, lacks in terms of healthy annual profits will not bother the warriors strapping on their body armour. By common consent the league is more cut-throat than ever, with no certainties beyond the fact Saracens and Exeter will again be near the top of the pile. Those embracing this liberating sense of possibility stand a better chance of success than those clinging to past\u0026nbspglories.Because, as the Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, pithily observed this week, this is shaping up to be a campaign unlike any of its predecessors. “I think it’s different to how it’s ever been. There are two teams head and shoulders above the rest – Saracens and Exeter – and then there is a pack of 10. I don’t think we can say who’s going to struggle with the same clarity we’ve always had.” Spot-on.Many are nominating Worcester as the favourites for the drop, even though they won at Sandy Park and had too much for Gloucester, Newcastle and Harlequins in the second half of last season. If anyone should be nervous it is surely Quins, beaten in their concluding five games of 2017-18 and just starting out under new management. Having rejected the high-class services of Ben Ryan and Shaun Edwards, the club’s hierarchy will be praying Paul Gustard proves a wise choice as John Kingston’s\u0026nbspsuccessor.In that regard the first three weeks will be hugely instructive, not least Bristol’s sparkly opener under lights against Bath at Ashton Gate on Friday. In their last Premiership incarnation two seasons ago Bristol did not register a victory until Boxing Day. This time the newly styled and beefed-up Bears have no intention of being prematurely stuffed, with their inspirational coach, Pat Lam, aiming for the top six. In that event, there will be some seriously displeased club owners in the table’s bottom half.Along with Bath, already without the injured Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph, even Wasps and Leicester have a battle on their hands to guarantee European qualification. Like it or not Wasps will miss Danny Cipriani’s wrists of gold, and Jimmy Gopperth’s season-ruining knee injury is extremely untimely. Leicester find themselves in even less familiar territory, having failed to reach the play-offs last season for the first time since 2004. A fit and firing Manu Tuilagi would help but the big man’s career now has an element of Waiting for Godot attached.Gloucester, on the other hand, are a side with the fresh artillery to surprise a few. Jaco Kriel and Franco Mostert will stiffen their pack, as will their fellow South Africans Franco Marais, Gerbrandt Grobler and Ruan Dreyer. Biltong sales in the Cotswolds could shortly soar and so, too, will Cipriani’s stock if he succeeds in putting his recent cameo role in Bergerac behind him.Newcomers to the world’s most unpredictable league such as Northampton’s Chris Boyd will find it a relentless experience, with last season’s pacesetters still out in front. The received wisdom that Exeter need to find a tactical plan B fails to reflect the certainty that Rob Baxter and his coaches will locate one. Stand by, too, for the sight of Matt Kvesic reminding everyone what an influential player he can be.Which leaves Saracens, title winners last season despite a string of injuries. In a league that could yet see a resurgence in specialist breakdown predators – Kvesic, Kriel, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Thomas Young, Lewis Ludlow, Heinrich Brüssow – keep an eye on young Ben Earl who, alongside a fit-again Michael Rhodes and Billy Vunipola, has the ability to propel Saracens to further silverware. The 2019 World Cup, for the moment, can wait.

A top-spinner rattles into Broad’s pads and, with the umpire unmoved, India review. The batsman was sweeping and the ball hit the back leg but I imagine it’ll be umpire’s call on impact … and, in fact, Hawkeye shows the impact was outside the line (though the umpires have taken the impact as being the front pad). Broad celebrates the reprieve by edging the last ball of the over between Pant and first slip, the ball trundling away for four.70th over: England 217-8 (Broad 6, Curran 61) Hardik Pandya, expensive earlier, returns to the fray and four leg byes take the extras column to a healthy 33. Broad joins in the fun with a thrash over the covers for three, and Curran pulls the last for a couple more.69th over: England 206-8 (Broad 1, Curran 59) Fifty for Sam Curran! A smashes a slog-sweep into the stands at cow corner for six, which also takes England to 200. And a couple of balls later he hammers four more to the same area. He’s been a nugget of diamante in an England batting order of gristle and twigs.“In the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, it is pointed out that those who most want to lead are usually those least suited to do so,” writes Andrew Benton. “On that basis, choose the person who least wants to be captain and you’ll get a brilliant one.” 68th over: England 194-8 (Broad 1, Curran 47) So Bumrah gets six balls at Broad. Four outswingers probe away at Broad’s outside edge … but Broad keeps out the inevitable inswinger (which, come to think of it, isn’t a bad name for a pub). Broad keeps out the last neatly enough. A maiden.67th over: England 194-8 (Broad 1, Curran 47) Sharma is frustrated with himself after straying on to Broad’s pads and allowing the England No 10 to escape to the non-striker’s end midway through the over. Pant is on his knees again a couple of balls later as Sharma strays down leg once more, the ball swings away, and for more byes zip past the outstretched keeper. Curran thunks the penultimate ball of the over for four through the covers to rub in a bit of salt.66th over: England 185-8 (Broad 1, Curran 43) Four more byes! More hooping swing from Bumrah, who has again strayed down the leg side. Poor old Pant, who has kept very well by and large (that slightly weird drop of Buttler notwithstanding), has 18 byes against his name.65th over: England 179-8 (Broad 1, Curran 42) There was no sense of permanence about Rashid at the crease there but it took a decent delivery to unseat him. It was swinging prodigiously and the replays show … it was missing leg. Broad gets off the mark with an inside edgeRashid clips a couple to fine leg Sharma responds with a rocket of a delivery that whistles past off stump. And follows that with a vicious inswinger that crashes into Rashid’s pads. Up goes the finger and, reviewless, Rashid has to walk.64th over: England 175-7 (Rashid 4, Curran 41) Bumrah returns and troubles Rashid with a bit of extra bounce, catching the leading edge and squirting away for a single through gully. “If we’re considering cricket captains as generals,” begins John Starbuck, “the Douglas Jardine was probably Alexander the Great, being complexly ruthless. His successors were the disappointing Ptolemies, making Rachel Heyhoe Cleopatra? Also, on TMS, Boycott talking about the number of Cookie’s partners: ‘There must be at least a dozen: count them on your fingers.’ It’s good to have him back.”63rd over: England 174-7 (Rashid 3, Curran 41) Curran is Playing A Few Shots now, though has picked up the unfortunate habit of finding the fielders in the last couple of overs. Sharma remains on the money.62nd over: England 172-7 (Rashid 2, Curran 40) Curran smashes a couple of loose Ashwin deliveries straight at fielders but squeezes a single away later in the over. Only three players have scored more runs in the series than the Surrey all-rounder: Buttler, Bairstow and Kohli. 61st over: England 171-7 (Rashid 2, Curran 39) Sharma thunders in once more, with India surely fancying their chances of keeping England to under 200. Rashid, though, gets off the mark with a whip through square leg. There’s a stifled appeal from the last as Sharma finds the pad, but it’s hooping down leg.60th over: England 168-7 (Rashid 0, Curran 38) A frustrating end for Moeen, who was going well but undone by a bit of extra bounce. His 40 has helped keep England in the game … for now. “Re Prince Eugene of Savoy: any historian’s out there able to confirm whether he came from the right sort of family?”wonders Matthew Valentine.Just when you thought it was safe … Moeen looks to slog sweep Ashwin away for his third six but top edges into the leg side. There’s a moment of concern as Bumrah and Pant threaten to get into a tangle but the former slides in to take a very fine catch.59th over: England 167-6 (Moeen 40, Curran 37) Ishant Sharma (11-6-11-1) returns with India’s stranglehold on the game loosening a touch. Curran has a big waft at a wide one without success but there’s four byes from the last!58th over: England 161-6 (Moeen 40, Curran 35) Ashwin drops a little short and Curran cashes in, smiting square of the wicket for four.“Prince Eugene was a very good general, but left nothing in the way of a succession plan for those to follow,” writes Kurt Baird, who seems to know about these things. “The poor lot that did succeed him had to contend with 80 years of military kings. Could I suggest Captain Strauss was our Eugene, and Cook and Root the poor successors. Which must mean Kohli is Napoleon ...”57th over: England 156-6 (Moeen 40, Curran 30) Shami again draws a play-and-miss, with Moeen this time lining up a booming drive and connecting only with Southampton air. Four byes add insult to injury, with Rishabh Pant left helpless by some on obscene movement on the ball. Still, he kips up like Bret Hart in his pomp to cheer himself up.“One of the many joys of OBO is you learn something new every day,” writes Brian Withington. “I must confess I had never heard of Prince Eugene of Savoy before. Never mind Mike Brearley, his Wiki resumé makes Napoleon look like a callow corporal who’d be lucky to captain Ilford Second Team.” 56th over: England 152-6 (Moeen 40, Curran 30) A huge appeal from Ashwin as he straightens one on to Curran’s pads. But has he straightened it enough? Dhamasena thinks not but India review … and it’s umpire’s call, with the ball clipping leg. To the naked eye, it barely turned at all, but it ended up very close. Nevertheless, a maiden.55th over: England 152-6 (Moeen 40, Curran 30) A rare play-and-miss from Curran as Shami continues. Just a single from the over, Curran cutting away to deep point from the last.54th over: England 151-6 (Moeen 40, Curran 29) Moeen dances down the pitch at Ashwin and launched him into the stands at long on for six. Super shot.53rd over: England 143-6 (Moeen 34, Curran 28) With the shine off the ball, the threat level has dropped considerably. Shami struggles to trouble either batsman here.“Are there any captains in county cricket with Brearley-like captaining skills, who’d be worth a place despite being inferior batsmen?” wonders Andrew Robinson. “I don’t know, and you don’t often see it written about. Would OBO readers know?” Given even wicketkeepers can’t get picked for Being The Best Wicketkeeper, you’d need to be some sort of tactician up there with Prince Eugene of Savoy to have a chance.52nd over: England 140-6 (Moeen 31, Curran 27) Ashwin continues after the tea break with England looking to continue this mini-fightback. It’s a little murky out there now, with the clouds having drifted over, though the forecast doesn’t suggest any rain in the offing. Moeen taps down the ground for one.And it’s time for tea. This partnership is now worth a handy 53. See you in 10.51st over: England 139-6 (Ali 30, Curran 27) This has been an excellent little spell for England – this pair have really managed to quieten the game down. They’re still in a hole, no question about that, but at least the sense of chaos has abated for now. And, predictably enough, just as I type that Curran has to e full length as he threatens to run himself out while attempting a panicky quick single. A play-and-a-miss follows a couple of balls later, then Shami is just off the mark with a yorker that Curran does well to deal with.50th over: England 135-6 (Ali 28, Curran 25) Ashwin (5-2-7-0) is proving difficult to get away but hasn’t bowled many wicket-threatening deliveries. A couple of singles.49th over: England 133-6 (Ali 27, Curran 24) Moeen tucks Bumrah away to backward square leg for a single and the bowler for the first time is a little loose at Curran, sending a couple well down the leg side, though the batsman can’t cash in.48th over: England 132-6 (Ali 26, Curran 24) Ashwin sends down a maiden at Curran.47th over: England 132-6 (Ali 26, Curran 24) Curran does well to shovel away a Bumrah inswinger while Moeen jumps all over a bouncer and toe-ends a hook away for six!But also …46th over: England 125-6 (Ali 20, Curran 23) Ashwin once more and Curran pushes into the on side for one. Moeen bottom-edges slightly tentatively at a full delivery but otherwise is solid in defence. 45th over: England 124-6 (Ali 20, Curran 22) Moeen pulls Bumrah gently away for a single but is discomfited by an inswinger a few balls later and straightened up by another cracker from the last.“Picking a captain at all levels of cricket is the same,” reckons Dave Brown. “They have to be a guaranteed pick for the side which narrows it down to four or five players. Then you choose the most sensible one that is least likely to make an arse of themselves away from the game.” That, or you can go down the whoever-has-the-best-appetite-for-admin route.44th over: England 122-6 (Ali 19, Curran 21) Despite the state of the England scorecard, there’s a happy hum at the Rose Bowl now, as lunchtime fades away and late afternoon drifts into view. Ashwin finds Curran’s edge but sees the ball pop too square for the man at slip. Another maiden, despite Curran’s clear eagerness to get after the spinner.43rd over: England 122-6 (Ali 19, Curran 21) Curran now has more runs in this series than Joe Root (and Cook, Stokes and Jennings for that matter). And, at 36, this is already England’s best partnership of the day. A maiden from Bumrah at Moeen on this occasion.42nd over: England 122-6 (Ali 19, Curran 21) Ashwin returns for his second tweak of the day – his first spell consisted of one over just after lunch. A couple of singles from this one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73b02dc783fbddf53c9a2deab30199a4844893b8/128_200_3160_1896/master/3160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6438e12768561fd432919c9ef0858a2c","title":"us open 2018 day four roger federer kerber kvitova zverev kyrgios cilic live","story":"The resourceful Daria Kasatkina has realised that Plan A and Plan B weren’t working so she’s on to Plan C and is about to serve to level her match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich, leading 5-4 in the second set. Hyeon Chung, a big talent who reached the Australian Open semi-finals but has had an injury-hit season since, has lost out in a first-set tie-break to Russia’s Mikhail Kukushkin. Vera Zvonareva’s a set down to Aryna Sabalenka, 6-3, while Dominika Cibulkova, who was on the warpath at Wimbledon after losing her seeding position to Serena Williams, is striding through the opening tie-break against Hsieh Su-wei, leading by five points to two.Osaka’s win means the Nick Kyrgios show will be commencing shortly on Court 17. Consider this your 10-minute warning. Kyrgios is one of five Australians to feature in the singles today – the others are De Minaur, Ebden, Millman and Tomljanovic – but that’s nothing compared to the French, who are staging something of a revolution with no fewer than nine players in action: Paire, Gasquet, Monfils, Garcia, Mladenovic. Benneteau, Mahut, Pouille and Herbert. And it’s Herbert who’s up against Kyrgios.Naomi Osaka hasn’t had too much to shout about since winning Indian Wells earlier this year but, back on the hard courts, the 20-year-old can be a real danger. She’s the first player to put a W by her name today, allowing Ukraine’s Julia Glushko only two games in a 6-2, 6-0 rout. That leaves the fifth seed serving for the set but again it’s a mixed bag. A wild drive volley and double fault is followed by an ace. 30-all. Wang then goes long and Kvitova has set point. Wang finds the corner with a forehand cross-court winner! Deuce. A nervous smash from Kvitova but she gets another chance to finish off the rally and here’s a second set point. Double fault! Deuce. A third set point. Kvitova miscues with her forehand! Deuce. A fourth set point. Deuce. A fifth set point. The game and set finally come to a close when Wang whacks out. Kvitova roars from the depths of her being. She’s extremely relieved. She’s taken the set 7-5.There’s been some turnaround on Louis Armstrong, where Petra Kvitova, having led 4-1, is powerless to stop Wang rattling off four games on the spin as the scoreboard tips in the world No 90’s favour for the first time. But from 5-4 down there’s another momentum shift as Kvitova climbs 6-5 up.A result from yesterday that perhaps didn’t get the attention it deserved, given it happened after 1am, was the surprise defeat of the former Wimbledon and French Open champion Garbine Muguruza to the Czech qualifier Karolina Muchova. It’s Muguruza’s second consecutive second-round defeat at a grand slam. Does it represent a couple of poor results or something more significant? Muguruza has always been a streaky player, as capable of winning slams as losing in the early rounds, but Daniela Hantuchova had some interesting thoughts on Amazon Prime a little earlier. The former world No 5, who was worryingly thin at times during her playing days, reckons Muguruza has lost too much weight and perhaps has been taking her eye off tennis and focusing on the media side a little too much. “I saw her for the first time in a while on the practice courts and I was shocked,” Hantuchova said.Kasatkina still can’t figure out the best approach to this match. Serving at 5-2 down, the Russian’s facing a third set point. Sasnovich smacks the winner and that’s that. But Sasnovich isn’t the first player to get a set on the board today Naomi Osaka just beat her to it, taking the opening set also 6-2 against Ukraine’s Julia Glushko.Kvitova is still going strong on Louis Armstrong and has the double break for 4-1. When her game is on she makes it seem so easy. Over on Grandstand, however, the 11th seed Daria Kasatkina is in early trouble, 5-2 down to Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus. The 21-year-old Kasatkina has such huge variety to her game, it sometimes takes her a few games to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Weather watch. Federer will be pleased to hear it won’t be quite as hot as yesterday. But it’s still hot enough for the heat policy to be in effect for the third day in a row. Temperatures are forecast to reach around 33C.Kvitova has been in fine form away from the grand slams this year, winning five titles, but she’s struggled in the majors, admitting the nerves have got to her. But she’s looking sharp early on against the New York-based Wang Yafan of China, breaking in the opening game. The second game isn’t quite so straightforward, with the Czech having to recover from 0-40 down to back up the break. It’s 2-0.And they’re off ...! Among the early runners and riders: the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, the bright young things Hyeon Chung, Daria Kasatkina and Naomi Osaka, plus Dominika Cibulkova and Vera Zvonareva, the 2010 finalist who came through qualifying and is making her first main-draw appearance since 2011 after giving birth to her daughter a couple of years ago. The Russian is one of seven mothers who started in the draw.Before we focus on today’s proceedings, there are a couple of talking points from yesterday, because there were strong words from Andy Murray and Alize Cornet.Murray was less than impressed after his loss to Fernando Verdasco, accusing the Spaniard of talking to his coach during the heat break and then lying about it. After Verdasco said: “I don’t want to say that Andy lied but I didn’t talk one word with my coach,” Murray wrote on Instagram: “I’m off to get a health check as apparently I’ve started imagining things. #liarliarpantsonfire.” So it doesn’t look like Murray’s lost any of his competitiveness despite his year off tour ...As for Cornet, she took aim not at the US Open after her code violation for taking her shirt off on court, but at the French federation president following the decision to ban Serena Williams from wearing a catsuit at future French Opens, despite Williams saying it helped protect her against blood clots. “Bernard Giudicelli lives in another time,” Cornet said. “What he said about Serena’s catsuit was 10,000 times worse than what happened to me on the court on Tuesday, because he’s the president of the French federation and because he doesn’t have to do that. These kind of comments are totally shocking for me.”Courts start at 11am ET4pm BST unless statedRoger Federer loves perfection but it’s been an imperfect couple of months for the GOAT. First there was the Wimbledon quarter-final defeat, where he’d been putting on an exhibition against Kevin Anderson before losing from two sets to love and match point up. Then there was Cincinnati, where he was outclassed and outmoved by Novak Djokovic in the final, leading some to question the 37-year-old’s confidence and suggest his extraordinary revival over the past two years may be starting take its toll on his energy levels. And now there is this. Because instead of being given a second consecutive night match as both Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal were yesterday, he’s going to have to mix with the commoners on tour and play in the hottest part of the day session this afternoon. The indignity! Who knows, the man who does not perspire may even sweat. Federer is one of four former US Open champions in action on Arthur Ashe today. He follows the 2016 winner and current Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber against Sweden’s Johanna Larsson, whose match in the first round hit the headlines because of the Alize Cornet shirt-changing row. Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova play in the night session, with Djokovic facing the American Tennys Sandgren and Sharapova, the champion of 12 years ago who has been far from grand-slam winning form this year, taking on Romania’s Sorana Cirstea.Over on Louis Armstrong, Caroline Wozniacki will be sipping imaginary margaritas later, but not before Petra Kvitova, Alex Zverev, Madison Keys, Gael Monfils and Kei Nishikori all play. Monfils and Nishikori face each other in one of the standout matches of the second round, while the battle of the young guns between the 19-year-old Australian Alex De Minaur and the 20-year-old American Frances Tiafoe could be tasty too. And there’s also the 2014 champion Marin Cilic, Nick Kyrgios, Jelena Ostapenko, Caroline Garcia and Naomi Osaka to throw into the day four mix.

Google Assistant sorts voice commands, controls and questions exactly the same as Google’s smaller smart speaker offerings, but the way it sounds couldn’t be more different.The Home Max is relatively large box speaker, by smart speaker standards, with a white or black smooth plastic body and grey or charcoal coloured fabric front. In white and grey it’s simple fabric front and rounded corners make the Home Max look a bit bland up next to a Sonos Play:5 or an Apple HomePod, but it might be easier to blend in with soft home furnishings. It is about the size of a large bookcase speaker, but weighs over 5kg.White dots in the centre of the fabric front show when the Home Max is actively listening to you, when it’s working on a query or speaking to you, or shows the volume level when you adjust it.It can be stood up vertically or placed horizontally with a little rubber foot that attaches to the bottom magnetically. When horizontal the hidden touch strip on top acts as a pause-play button and a volume slider, both of which work well.A mute switch on the back allows you to turn off the microphones if you would like a little privacy from Google Assistant’s listening out for its wake words, which are either “Hey Google” or the older “Okay, Google”. When the mute switch is flicked the dots light up red until you turn the mics back on.An analogue 3.5mm line-in socket and USB-C port round out the back, alongside the figure-of-eight power cable. There’s also Bluetooth for streaming your music directly from a phone, tablet or computer if you need to.Setting up the Home Max is super easy, but requires an Android or iOS device. Just plug it in, open the Google Home app on your smartphone or tablet, tap the button to set up a new device and follow the instructions. It took about five minutes to get the speaker out of the box and playing music.Google Assistant is the same on the Home Max as it is on any other Google Home smart speaker. Since the original Home launched in May 2017, Assistant has become smarter answering more and more questions, and is impressively able to not only recognise the words you’re saying but also what you’re trying to say – when you butcher a question, Assistant will still be able to work out what you want, more often than not.Assistant also has the ability to recognise inidual voices using Google’s Voice Match – a feature still not available for Amazon’s Alexa in the UK – so when you ask for an update on your calendar or music from your library you get your stuff, rather than stuff belonging to someone else who lives in your house.Google has also continually added to Assistants smart home device control, which now rivals Amazon’s Alexa in most categories.But it is Assistant’s ability to control a wider range of music services, including Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music and Deezer – combined with the best voice recognition – which has made it the one to beat.The Home Max certainly produces a big, aggressive sound and is loud enough as a single unit to fill even large rooms. It’s front-facing two 4.5in woofers and two tweeters produce fairly direct sound, making the Home Max a speaker to put at the end of a room rather than in the middle of it like Apple’s HomePod or the cheaper Amazon Echo. It doesn’t really have a sweet spot, however, sounding pretty uniform no matter where you sit in front of it.It has an intelligent audio tweaking system called Smart Sound, which uses the mics and AI to adjust the music as you play to a account for location, noise sources, track and even the time of day. Apple’s HomePod has a similar system built in, but Sonos’s Play:5 and others require an iPhone or iPad to tune the speakers each time you move them.The Home Max sounds punchy, producing music with lots of attack in the mids and deep bass. If you like big booming bass, you will love the Home Max, but I found the bass a bit loose in some tracks, missing some subtlety – turning the bass down in the equaliser helped a little.Rap tracks such as Dr Dre’s Still DRE, Forgot About Dre or The Next Episode sounded really aggressive and great. Jazz tracks such as Moanin’ by Art Blakey sounded warm and punchy, and it even did a fairly good job with Holst’s Jupiter performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.It seemed most at home with pop tracks such as In My Feelings by Drake or Anywhere by Rita Ora. But playing tracks such as Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys, where the intro drum beats lost a bit of their alternating rhythm, or a live version of Hotel California by the Eagles, which lost clarity and separation between inidual notes and vocals, showed the Home Max’s weakness.It has a big, powerful sound, but it lacks the sparkle and subtlety something like the Sonos Play:5 or Apple’s HomePod brings, which allows you to discover new parts of your favourite tracks you might not have been able to hear before.The Smart Sound tuning improves over time, and I found that the sound was a little more room dependent than others, sounding better in the longer, more open kitchen than the living room.Volume consistency between tracks on Spotify was also weak, with some tracks drastically louder than the previous. Dynamic range is great, but feeling like you have to jockey the volume between tracks isn’t. I also found thedirect, aggressive nature of the sound a little wearing over extended listening sessions compared to some more immersive rivals.The Home Max can also play in multi-room audio groups with other Google Home or Chromecast devices, which makes filling your whole house with the same music easy. Stereo pairing is also available, but I did not have two to test.The Google Home Max costs £399 and comes in two colours: chalk or charcoal.For comparison, the Google Home costs £99, the Home Mini costs £39. Apple’s HomePod costs £319, the Sonos One costs £199 and the Sonos Play:5 costs £499.The Google Home Max is one big sound upgrade for Google Assistant, producing powerful, room-filling sound and booming bass.While Google Assistant is the best voice assistant available right now, with the widest range of music services and most capable voice recognition and understanding, the Home Max doesn’t quite match the exquisite audio produced by the likes of the Apple HomePod or Sonos Play:5.If you want a speaker to blast out music at a party or in the kitchen, the Home Max is brilliant. If you want a top-end living room listening experience to replace a great hi-fi, then at £400 this isn’t quite there yet.Pros: Google Assistant is great, multi orientation, loud and punchy, can always hear you, Bluetooth and analogue in, native Spotify and multiple other music services, adaptive sound, granular volume control via percentage, good touch controlsCons: variable volume in playlists, not much good for a non-Google user, smart speaker privacy concerns, better for some music genres than others, expensive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabbc26b55415263acbebbe4fdbf110c0fc76d84/0_539_5164_3098/master/5164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332ec8d8ba8ab339e4263f4a54e4e83d","title":"whats the best laptop for university under 600","story":"Linda’s history-studying son needs a portable computer. Which model would deliver value for money on a budget?My son is off to university and needs a laptop for his history course. His needs are coursework, watching movies, listening to music and gaming. Our needs are best value for money on a budget of £600 or less. What do you think of reconditioned laptops? We are not a poor household, but we are going to have to make a few sacrifices to get him through university. LindaIt’s always a good idea to see if the university andor department have any recommendations, discount deals or special requirements. This can be important for courses that use professional software, though I don’t expect history needs anything that won’t run on most laptops.In fact, any mainstream machine should suffice for most undergraduate purposes. Just make sure it has at least 4GB of memory and a 128GB SSD or larger hard drive, with 64GB of eMMC storage being the minimum. Also, aim for a processor that scores at least 2,000 on PassMark’s list of CPU benchmarks.More is better. If possible, double all those numbers. Don’t halve them.A fast PC could be considered a luxury for a student, but it saves time – and the extra cost per week is relatively small over a three- or four-year course.However, gaming could still be a problem. A £600 laptop will run games, but it won’t run AAA games at high frame-rates with all the graphical effects. In student flats, the best answer is usually a communal Xbox One or PlayStation 4.Traditionally, students have used mainstream laptops with 15.6in screens. They are cheap and do the job. However, they are too bulky to carry around all the time, and tend to have poor battery life.If your offspring wants to take a laptop to classes, it would be better to buy an ultraportable, or a convertible machine that doubles as a laptop and a tablet. There are plenty of cheap 2-in-1s and convertibles around but the powerful ones tend to be expensive.Microsoft Surface Pros are good for students because they are very robustly made and work with pen input: you can take handwritten notes and annotate things. However, they are beyond your budget, and there’s no point in paying for extra functionality if your son wouldn’t use it. Lenovo Yoga and HP x360 laptops are more affordable alternatives.You can also do quite a lot with a 6in smartphone and a small Bluetooth keyboard. Indeed, Android speech recognition is now so good that you don’t always need the keyboard. The smartphone also works as a note-taking camera, voice recorder and music player.Refurbished laptops are a good option for students and may look less nickable than shiny new ones. Ideally, buy direct from the original equipment manufacturer, such as Dell Outlet, or from refurbishers such as Tier1Online, which sells ex-corporate business laptops. These are built to a higher standard than consumer designs. However, you won’t save much unless you buy quite an old machine. A third-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon from 2015 could still bust your budget.I often suggest Tier1Online because the company will upgrade most laptops. You can usually get 8GB or more memory or swap a hard drive for an SSD at extra cost. It also guarantees laptops for up to three years for a small fee.In general, you should look at refurbished ThinkPads, particularly the X and T ranges. Dell Latitude and HP EliteBook laptops are also worth considering.For more tips, see my earlier answer to the question: would a cheap refurbished laptop run Photoshop?The best support option is a next-business-day on-site service from a supplier such as Dell or Lenovo. My son went through university with Dell’s on-site service and they came and fixed it both at home and at university. However, the cost varies. It can be cheap on desktops but expensive on cheap laptops that are more likely to break.Lenovo’s IdeaPad 3xx machines have recently been good choices, being better than the entry-level 1xx versions and cheaper than the more upmarket 5xx models. Today it looks as though the popular 320 and 320S are making way for the 330 and 330S so you may get an older one for less. Prices vary depending on the processor, memory, storage and screen size, but most fall within your price range.Check the screen and keyboard quality in store and try other retailers – such as John Lewis, Argos and local shops – for possible alternatives. The HP Pavilion and Envy, Acer Swift and Asus ZenBook ranges may have laptops with your target specs.Have you got a question?

He is attacking everything we believe in in New York. He has to be stopped. I’m going to fight with him,” Cuomo declared.“When it comes to opposing Donald Trump in New York state, we already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House. We don’t need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main opposition,” she said.Nixon, Broadway actor and former Sex and the City star, and Cuomo, son of the former New York Democratic governor Mario Cuomo, got into sharp spats at their debate on Wednesday evening.At one point Cuomo barked: “Can you stop interrupting?” at Nixon, who snapped back: “Can you stop lying?”Polls suggest the governor has a more than 30 percentage point lead over his opponent, who also trails substantially in fundraising.But Nixon has garnered plenty of attention with her famous name. And, with her leftwing platform of education reform and social and economic equality, she is seeking to ride a populist wave of candidates assailing establishment figures with challenges from the left.As a political ingenue who has not held office at any level before, she represents an audacious, if outside, threat to establishment figure Cuomo who has powerful standing in the party.Her campaign finally drew Cuomo into a debate at Hofstra University on Long Island. Nixon went after Cuomo early in the exchange, calling him corrupt and a liar and saying experience doesn’t matter if a politician is ineffective.“I’m not an Albany insider like Governor Cuomo, but experience doesn’t mean that much if you’re not actually good at governing,” she said, referring to the seat of New York government in the state capital.Cuomo responded that Nixon did not understand the challenges of leading the nation’s fourth largest state and lived in a “world of fiction”, while he resided in the real world where you don’t just “snap your fingers” and change happens.“That’s the art of government. I can get it done,” he said.The fireworks began even before the debate kicked off, with Nixon, who would be the state’s first female governor, complaining that Cuomo had imposed a series of demands on the debate’s organizers – and then making a request of her own.The challenger asked that the temperature in the room be set at 76F (24.5C). Campaign adviser Rebecca Katz wrote that workplace conditions are “notoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature”, according to an email obtained by the New York Times – referring to air conditioners being set on high to cater to suited men.Cuomo – who in recent weeks got in a heated spat with Trump after saying that America “was never that great”, comments he later walked back – has been discussed as a possible 2020 presidential contender for his party. But he pledged definitively during the debate to serve a full term if re-elected, which would preclude a presidential run. “Yes, yes, and double yes,” he said. “The only caveat is if God strikes me dead.”Also Wednesday, it was revealed that Cuomo received a $25,000 campaign donation from a law firm that formerly represented the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, six days before the governor called off an investigation into the Manhattan district attorney’s handling of sex abuse allegations against Weinstein, according to a report on the websites Capital \u0026amp Main and Sludge.The winner of the Democratic primary on 13 September will face the Republican Marc Molinaro and independent Stephanie Miner in November."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Tributes paid to Child and Family Agency boss after announcement of his departureOireachtas committee told State funding is falling well short of the real cost of educationMinister insists incoming Garda chief will bring experience and expertise to forceJudge told patient who weighs less than four stone five pounds has a long history of anorexiaThe National Lottery reveals there is one winner for Wednesday\u0026rsquos top prizeShauna Dunworth had fallen from Sydney\u0026rsquos Harbour Bridge in JulyM7 towards Stradbally being widened in Co Kildare section of M8 closed in Co CorkJudges at Special Criminal Court said all strands of evidence pointed towards his guiltChild and Family Agency launches \u0026euro10m childcare database to replace 17 separate systems across the StateTwo children have been charged over death of Kildare schoolgirl (14) in MayWoman from Co Antrim was refused benefit after her partner of 23 years died from cancer in 2014Store in Tallaght suffered significant damage when looters used excavator to access storeThe latest potential candidate is a Jaguar-driving US-based businessman from DerryDisadvantaged areas set to receive higher priority following Wesley grant controversyAhead of planned closures, Naughten says An Post will not be withdrawing contractsTemperatures are set to reach 20 degrees during a period of warm, settled weatherDragons\u0026rsquo Den investor becomes 11th potential candidateNew Horizons aims to rendezvous with Kuiper-Belt object on New Year\u0026rsquos Day 2019"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612583.1535631243!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unmarried mother siobhan mclaughlin wins right to widow s allowance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFile photo of Siobhan McLaughlin (centre) with two of her children Billy and Rebecca Adams. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA An unmarried mother from Northern Ireland has won a British Supreme Court battle to access a widowed parent’s allowance for her bereaved children.Siobhan McLaughlin (46) was refused the benefit after her partner John Adams died from cancer in January 2014 because the couple, who had four children and were together for 23 years, were not married or in a civil partnership.Ms McLaughlin is a special needs classroom assistant from Armoy, Co Antrim. The late Mr Adams was a groundsman. Their children are Rebecca (15), Billy (16), Lisa (21) and Stuart (23).Following Mr Adams’s death, Ms McLaughlin had to take on an evening job after being refused widowed parent’s allowance by the Northern Ireland Department for Communities.She initially won a case after claiming unlawful discrimination based on her marital status, but that ruling was later overturned by the British Court of Appeal.But, by a majority of four justices to one, the British Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the current law on the allowance is “incompatible” with Human Rights legislation.Giving the lead judgment, the court’s President Lady Hale said: “The allowance exists because of the responsibilities of the deceased and the survivor towards their children.“Those responsibilities are the same whether or not they are married to or in a civil partnership with one another.“The purpose of the allowance is to diminish the financial loss caused to families with children by the death of a parent.“That loss is the same whether or not the parents are married or in a civil partnership with one another.”However, Lady Hale said not every case where an unmarried parent is denied the allowance after the death of their partner will be unlawful.The court also said it is up to the British Government to decide whether or how to change the law.Speaking outside court after the April hearing in the Supreme Court, which sat in Northern Ireland for the first time, Ms McLaughlin thanked supporters.Attending with two of her children, she said: “This case was never about me. I would love to be recognised as a widow but I accept in the eyes of the law and the Government that I am not.“What I wasn’t prepared to accept was how the Government viewed my children — how they could treat my grieving, bereaved children as insignificant.“I am such a private person but to sit and accept that this is how it is made me say, ‘No, this is wrong’.“I want to look my children in the eye and say it is the Government at fault here, not you, and because of this I have tried to rectify this for you.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612425.1535637401!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"so who is presidential hopeful peter casey","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Peter Casey: “I had to buy a Jaguar as they are owned by my largest client, Tata.” \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Peter Casey: “I had to buy a Jaguar as they are owned by my largest client, Tata.” Peter Casey, who is probably best known for his role on RTÉ’s Dragon’s Den series, is the founder and chief executive officer of the global recruitment business Claddagh Resources. The firm, which was set up in Atlanta in the US in 1995, operates from five locations worldwide and its European base is located outside Buncrana, Co Donegal. He has previously had business interests in Australia and Ireland.  Casey (60) is one of nine children from a Co Derry family. He is a graduate in business and politics from Aston University in Birmingham, England. He and his wife, Helen, who is from Crumlin in Dublin, have five children. In recent years, Casey bought a home in Donegal and considered standing as a general election candidate in the northwest. However, he decided not to as he wanted his youngest child to finish school in the US. He attempted to win a seat in the Seanad in 2016 after being nominated by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec) for a place on the House’s Industrial and Commercial Panel.When outlining his agenda as a Seanad candidate, he said he intended to support foreign direct investment, indigenous businesses and job creation. He called for a greater focus on rural Ireland, citing a need to address the concentration of commercial activity and the administration in central Dublin.However, he did not secure one of the nine seats on the panel. Casey appeared on two season’s of Dragon’s Den, alongside Gavin Duffy, who is also seeking a nomination to contest the presidential election. His time on the show did not crossover with that of Seán Gallagher, who is trying to run for the presidency again after losing out to Michael D. Higgins in 2011. In an interview with The  in 2016, Casey said he had bought a farm in Derry a decade earlier for €1.4 million. He said the most expensive thing he owned was his car, a Jaguar XJL Supercharged Supersport. “I had to buy a Jaguar as they are owned by my largest client, Tata,” he added. He said he had bought and lost a lot of money on Apple shares. Asked if he had ever lost money, he replied: “Loads of times. I made many bad investments, but I have selective amnesia”. Casey has previously bought houses in Derry that were under threat of being repossessed by banks and then leased them back to the occupants. In January 2015, he said he held 16 such properties.“We basically buy them before the banks foreclose and we enter into a long-term lease with the tenants,” he said at the time. “It’s a win-win. It means people are able to stay in the property. I get a much better return than what I was getting on money sitting in the bank and I’ve got an appreciating asset.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611674.1535566439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk says no deal brexit the only alternative to chequers plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab at the parliamentary committee on Wednesday. “You have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said.  Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesBritain has warned the European Union that a no-deal Brexit is the only alternative to Theresa May’s proposal for partial membership of the single market. Cabinet secretary David Lidington, Ms May’s de facto deputy, told a French business conference that it was too late to come up with alternative proposals for a future economic relationship.“With exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission, or the risk of there being no deal,” he said.“The alternative models do not meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered. So, we need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.”Ms May’s proposal, agreed at Chequers last month, would keep Britain in the single market for goods and agricultural products but not for services. Britain would follow EU regulations for goods but would not offer free movement to EU citizens and would leave the customs union.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday that the EU was prepared to offer Britain a partnership “such as has never been with any other third country”. But he stressed that Britain must respect the EU’s core structures, saying that “single market means single market”, before adding that “this is not negotiable”.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab dismissed reports that Mr Barnier was not making himself available for negotiations and expressed confidence that a deal can be agreed. He acknowledged that the issue of a backstop to guarantee no return to a hard Border remained the biggest stumbling block in the negotiations.“The prime minister has been clear . . . that the EU’s proposals are unacceptable, mainly because of the effect they would have on the UK common market and the constitutional integrity of the UK,” he said.Mr Raab told the House of Lords EU committee that Britain continued to insist that the backstop must be time-limited and he suggested that EU law might also require it to be temporary.“As a matter of law under article 50 there are constraints on the period of time for which a backstop could last. Obviously, ultimately that has to be tested,” he said.The Brexit secretary said that votes in the House of Commons on amendments to Brexit-related legislation demonstrated that opposition parties shared the government’s determination to reject any backstop that could undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the UK.\u0026nbsp“It was quite a good opportunity to reinforce the fact that we don’t just have a Conservative and unionist government, but we also have a unionist parliament. On all the amendments that would have risked the concern that we have around a customs border in the Irish Sea, parliament clearly supported the government’s position. So you have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The fashion industry in Rome is not what it used to be,” Simona Belcastro, the great-granddaughter of the founder of the business, told The .“The rent is far too high and we are six to seven months in arrears. Then there are bills to pay, accountants’ fees … we just can’t manage it any more.

The collection has been given an estimated value of £24,000. A letter, dated June 2, 1986, sent to the Emmanuels by Diana\u0027s lady-in-waiting, Anne Beckwith-Smith, outlined the strict requirements for her garments during the tour.She wrote: Certain special requirements concerning dress need to be observed and I am writing to ask if it would be possible to submit to The Princess of Wales a few sketches for day and evening wear from which Her Royal Highness could select items for this tour.Their Royal highnesses will be visiting Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In all cases modesty is the order of the day.An invoice for the dresses also features in the sale revealing they cost between £275 and £450 each. The collection has been consigned for sale by a private collector and it is believed that this is the first time it has emerged on the market.A letter to Princess Diana\u0026#39s wedding dress maker Elizabeth EmanuelBobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auctions, said: Princess Diana tried to conform to local customs by wearing concealing clothes, but still exposed her neck and left her head uncovered.At evening banquets, she appeared in the long sleeved demure dresses made especially for the tour.

Sterling fell by as much as 0.3 per cent against the dollar\u0026nbspafter the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in a German radio interview that the bloc is prepared for a no-deal Brexit. “After the sterling bounce yesterday,\u0026nbspBarnier has used a German radio interview this morning to remind the market that the EU is also planning for a no-deal scenario,” Jeremy Stretch at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, told Bloomberg.“This suggests they are not intent on a deal at all costs and that sterling gains may prove tough to hold onto.”The pound was boosted on Tuesday, rising 1.2 per cent against the dollar, and 1 per cent against the euro, after Mr Barnier said the EU is “prepared to offer a partnership with Britain such as has never been with any other third country. His positive remarks came as Brexit secretary Dominic Raab told the Lords EU committee that he was “confident a deal is within our sights”“We\u0027re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal,” he said. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said many investors would be wondering whether Mr Barnier’s positive statement on Wednesday could be a turning point for the pound. “Although many issues related to trade and the Irish border are far from being resolved, it currently seems that negotiations may begin moving in the right direction. However, expect volatility to surge in the coming weeks as we get closer to the Brexit deadline,” he said.The pound remained up against the euro, trading up 0.02 per cent at €1.1128 by mid-morning.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/19/energy-drinks.jpg","title":"energy drinks ban caffeine under 16 government theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.Scheme will see retailers blocked from selling the drinks to under-16s and possibly even under-18sClick to followThe IndependentSome energy drinks contain exceptionally high levels of sugar, with on average 60 per cent more calories and 65 per cent more sugar than other regular soft drinksShops will be banned from selling Red Bull and other drinks “packed to the brim with caffeine” to teenagers, under plans announced by Theresa May.The scheme will see retailers blocked from selling energy drinks to under 16s and possibly even under 18s.Insiders told The Independent the intention is to use the same sanctions as selling cigarettes to children – meaning shops could be slapped with fines of\u0026nbsp£2,500.Energy drinks set to be banned for under-16s as part of obesity planAldi and Asda to restrict sales of energy drinks to under 16sEnergy drinks cause dangerous side effects in half of young peopleJamie Oliver urges Government to ban selling energy drinks to childrenMs May said she was acting as evidence shows excessive consumption of the drinks by children is linked to serious health problems. Some deaths are even connected to them.The move was welcomed by campaigners including Jamie Oliver, but there will be a backlash from manufacturers and even some ministers who see it as “nanny-statism”.Speaking during her trip to Africa, the prime minister said: “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children. \u0026nbsp“It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life.”She launched a consultation on exactly how the ban should work, though the intention is it will apply to drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre.\u0026nbspConfirming the measure will now be pushed through, one government insider said: “It is a question of how, not whether we do it.”\u0026nbspOne 250ml can of Red Bull contains around 80mg of caffeine – the equivalent of nearly three cans of cola.Some energy drinks also contain exceptionally high levels of sugar, with on average 60 per cent more calories and 65 per cent more sugar than other regular soft drinks.\u0026nbspWith more than two-thirds of 10 to 17-year-olds and a quarter of six to nine-year-olds consuming energy drinks, they are likely contributing to both obesity and tooth decay.Officials argue that excessive consumption has already been linked to health issues in children, from headaches and sleep problems to stomach aches and hyperactivity.The death of Irish 18-year-old Ross Cooney in 2000, after he drank four cans during a basketball match, led to calls for more research.Health news in pictures152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1452 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1552 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1652 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1752 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1852 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1952 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2052 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2252 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2552 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2652 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2752 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2852 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2952 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say3052 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3152 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3252 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3352 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3452 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3552 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3652 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3852 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3952 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).4052 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.4152 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4252 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4352 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4452 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4552 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4752 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4852 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4952 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.5052 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 5152 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.852 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.952 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.1052 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1152 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1252 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites.

They even say ‘not for children’ on the labels.”Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics, and Public Health England chief executive Duncan Selbie also backed the ban.But Ms May is likely to face push back from the drinks industry already subject to sugar restrictions. \u0026nbspOne senior minister also hit out last night that government policy has been reduced to “a ban a day”.The frontbencher fumed: Every day, something else banned. It\u0027s just so depressing.The consultation launches on Thursday lasting 12 weeks and invites views on the age from which restrictions on buying energy drinks should apply – either 18 years old or 16 years old as options.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/26/09/Housing-market.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/26/09/Housing-market.jpg","title":"london house prices no deal brexit latest housing market","story":"Created with Sketch.One expert\u0026nbsppredicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent in the event of a disruptive exit from the EUClick to followThe IndependentUK asking prices fell by £7,000 in August, recent figures showedHouse prices in London are set to fall this year and next, and could crash if a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspoccurs, according to a Reuters poll of property experts and analysts.

The national average price for a property was £301,973 in August, and in London it rose to £609,205. “The weight of evidence suggests that housing is overvalued once more,” said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics.Experts said there was a one in three chance of a “significant correction” in the London market. When asked what effect a disorderly Brexit would have on prices, answers ranged from “short term fall” to “damaging” to “disaster”. When asked about the likelihood of a significant correction in London’s housing market before the end of 2019, the specialists gave a relatively high median of 29 per cent, with the highest response 75 per cent.One respondent predicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent. “We see little upward or downward pressure on house prices at current near-zero interest rates.

The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/31/16/ISSgulfmexico.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3682066  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Earth from the ISS  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/31/16/ISSgulfmexico.jpg","title":"nasa international space station leak iss latest alarm soyuz module","story":"Created with Sketch.Nasa working to contain small leak on International Space StationEngineers are working to fix the holeClick to followThe Independent TechNasa\u0026nbspis working to contain a small leak onboard the International Space Station.The issue appears to be contained and the people on board the station do not appear to be under any immediate threat.

They are the only known fossils of babies from an extinct mammal relative that lived during the early Jurassic periodA “rarest of the rare” fossil of an enormous fanged rat-like animal surrounded by a litter of 38 hatched and unhatched offspring has been unearthed in Arizona, offering new insight into the transition between reptiles and mammals during the Jurassic period.Mammals are today distinguished by their means of reproduction in which they produce relatively few, live young. In comparison, reptiles lay large clutches of eggs. The discovery of a baby snake fossil offers a clue on their evolutionDinosaurs are much weirder than we ever thoughtHow did birds survive the dinosaur-killing asteroid?Birds ‘had to learn to fly again’ after meteor killed dinosaursThe creature, named Kayentatherium wellesi, and which was a forerunner to modern mammals and belonged to a group known as the tritylodonts, was about the size of a small dog, and had large fangs on both its upper and lower jaw. \u0026nbspDespite its appearance, it was herbivorous, and would have lived alongside dinosaurs about 185 million years ago.The remarkable discovery of the animal’s offspring comes a full 18 years after the initial mother’s remains were found, when palaeontologists re-examined the sediment sample and carried out CT scans to reveal the huge litter. “Looking at the CT scans I was able to discover baby after baby after baby,” said study leader Eva Hoffman, who led the research as a graduate student in geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin.“These babies are from a really important point in the evolutionary tree,” she added. “They had a lot of features similar to modern mammals, features that are relevant in understanding mammalian evolution.”Kayentatherium. It is about 1 centimetre long (Eva Hoffman  The University of Texas at Austin)Zhe-Xi Luo, a palaeontologist and professor at The University of Chicago, described the discovery as “stunning” and said\u0026nbspthey would\u0026nbspprovide scientists valuable insight into mammal evolution.“These great fossils really gave us a rare glimpse of how early mammals evolved from their ancestors,” he said.The highly detailed scans allowed Ms Hoffman to examine the shape of the offsprings’ skulls, which appear as “scaled down replicas” a tenth of the size of the adult and with all features in proportion - a trait typically seen in reptile offspring. In modern mammals, young are born with shortened faces and bulbous heads to account for big brains.The discovery that Kayentatherium had a tiny brain and many babies, despite otherwise having much in common with mammals, suggests a critical step in the evolution of mammals was trading big litters for big brains, and that this step happened later in mammalian evolution, the study said.Ms Hoffman co-authored the study with her graduate adviser, Jackson School Professor Timothy Rowe, who unearthed the fossil in 2000. Sebastian Egberts, a former graduate student and fossil preparator at the Jackson School, spotted the first sign of the babies years later when a grain-sized speck of tooth enamel caught his eye in 2009 as he was unpacking the fossil.“It didn’t look like a pointy fish tooth or a small tooth from a primitive reptile,” said Mr Egberts, who is now an instructor of anatomy at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. “It looked more like a molariform tooth (molar-like tooth) — and that got me very excited.”Kayentatherium was a forerunner to modern mammals (Eva Hoffman  The University of Texas at Austin)A CT scan of the fossil undertaken in 2009 revealed a handful of bones inside the rock. But it took advances in CT-imaging technology during the next seven years, the expertise of technicians at UT Austin’s High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility (UTCT), and extensive digital processing by Ms Hoffman to reveal the rest of the offspring - not just their jaws and teeth, but complete skulls and partial skeletons - the University of Texas said in a statement.Dinosaurs in the Wild Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the Wild“There are additional deep stories on the evolution of development, and the evolution of mammalian intelligence and behaviour and physiology that can be squeezed out of a remarkable fossil like this now that we have the technology to study it,” Professor Rowe said.To find so many offspring together from the Jurassic period is unprecedented as young animals would tend to have been destroyed or eaten in the event they had not made it to adulthood.University of TexasEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/11/POLITICS-Drinks-07003013.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/11/POLITICS-Drinks-07003013.jpg","title":"emails commuting office should count as work university west england","story":"Created with Sketch.More than half of people use their smartphones for work activities while travellingClick to followThe IndependentRelated: Messy desks could be a sign of geniusChecking emails on commute should ‘count as work’, researchers sayGoing through emails on your commute into the office should “count as work”, researchers have said.\u0026nbspA study conducted by the University of the West England looked at 5,000 rail passengers and found that 54 per cent spent their journey into work looking at emails.Researchers concluded that smartphones and widespread internet access on journeys had caused a “blurring of boundaries” between life at home and work.Third of Britons ‘so stressed they have checked work emails in night’Work email could be banned outside office hours by New York CityTaking days off work can help you live longer, new study findsThe 9 most annoying phrases people use in work emails“How do we count that time?

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its GDP is growing rapidly. Similar to India, its middle classes are rocketing. And its workforce is estimated to be larger than China’s by 2035.Over 17 millions Brits voted for a Brexit that would make us a freer, richer country.This is exactly the type of buccaneering move that will make that vision a reality.THE EU’s threats regarding a No Deal Brexit are total bluster.The bloc claims there will be chaos if we leave without a deal, that the impact on trade and travel will be so severe we will crawl back to the negotiating table.But behind closed doors, the EU admits this is codswallop.The EU Commission has drawn up secret No Deal plans that are “very similar” to Britain’s Brexit preparation.In other words, in the event of a No Deal they will keep things almost exactly the same because they don’t want to be hit.What a surprise.WHEN will Labour moderates realise their party is beyond repair?Jewish Labour MPs need bodyguards for the party conference next month. There is a backlog of anti-Semitism complaints that could take YEARS to probe. And their leader is an ­anti-Semitic IRA-apologist, who counts the former BNP leader and the KKK among his cheerleaders.By staying in the party, Labour MPs signal that they want Corbyn to be PM.No amount of tribal loyalty can make them think that is a good idea.IT is shocking that deadly diet pills are being brazenly flogged on Instagram.The Facebook-owned company must better protect youngsters.It should hire a proper workforce to establish oversight of what is put online.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He puts my needs first.”Legendary singer Prince, who passed away in April 2016, converted to the faith in 2001 following the death of his mother.He described his conversion as: a realisation. Its like Morpheus and Neo in The Matrix.A committed Jehovahs Witness to the end, a memorial for the star took place at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovahs Witnesses near his Minnesota home to commemorate his life.Canadian model Coco Rocha has opened up about her life as a devout Jehovahs Witness saying: faith is everything and despite her fame, she still preaches door-to-door.The whole purpose is to inform people. Some people think we’re a pushy religion, but if you’re not interested, just say so, she explained to luxury magazine Dujour.Naomi Campbells mum Valerie is also a follower, telling Vogue: I brought up Naomi as a Jehovahs Witness, but she must choose her faith for herself. I do give her literature on the subject though when she asks for it.However, the model has not followed in her mothers footsteps by becoming a believer.Other A-list celebs, including Janet Jackson, Ja Rule and actress Michelle Rodriguez were raised in the faith as children, but no longer practise it.Members follow their own version of the Bible called the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.They say our world now belongs to Satan, and because of this God  - who they call Jehovah - will end it very soon in order to create a new kingdom.Jehovahs Witnesses are not meant to make friends with people of other faiths, as non-believers are considered to belong to Satans world - although this isnt always strict as their celebrity followers show.Many followers say there is a a sense of community that can come with being a Jehovahs Witness - as they are tight-knit and have respect for each other.The easy-to-follow belief system is also a big draw for people interested in the faith, and the organisation has a lot of literature providing what they believe to be the answers to lifes big questions.A Jehovahs Witness church: followers of the faith reject blood transfusions as they are seen as sinfulJehovahs Witnesses are barred from having blood transfusions - which makes operations like Caesarean sections - that often require them - more difficult to complete, as blood products are linked to immorality.As one Jehovahs Witness told the New Yorker: It’s as much a sin to take a blood transfusion as to have an extramarital affair.This has led to several deaths - and ious court battles between Jehovahs Witnesses and doctors seeking to treat them.Last Autumn, a 27-year-old Canadian new mother, Éloïse Dupuis, died a week after giving birth due to haemorrhaging - but despite doctors pleas for her to have a blood transfusion she refused.Jehovahs Witnesses dont believe in sex before marriage - and dating isnt condoned unless they bring along a chaperone as well.So its likely that the first person you choose to date will be the person you marry.And after marriage, theres still restrictions on sex - namely anal and oral sex which are strictly forbidden, something that is also frowned upon in religions such as Islam and other forms of Christianity.Followers are peaceful - even refusing military service - but are suffering from persecution in some countries.Earlier this year, they were declared as an extremist group in Russia with raids on their churches and several arrests - its thought hundreds have fled the country and applied for asylum in Finland since.Other things they are prohibited from doing include being patriotic, as it is seen as worshipping an idol, or voting or canvassing for political parties as they remain politically neutral.As Jesus never celebrated his birthday, Jehovahs Witnesses dont mark theirs either, and they dont acknowledge the major Christian holidays of Christmas Day or Easter, as they believe these festivals are based on pagan customs.On the plus side, it means they probably save a lot of money due to not having to fork out for expensive gifts.Their beliefs in the end of the world have led to a series of unfulfilled prophecies.In 1975 they were told the world would end and members of the church were encouraged to preach full-time and get rid of their possessions.Thousands of them quit their jobs and sold their homes - but Armageddon didnt come leading to a drop in membership, something which has remained in decline ever since.Armageddon was also promised before the start of the Millennium, but again never materialised.There has also been other controversies: the Charity Commission are currently investigating claims that some followers were abused as children by fellow members of the faith.Members are known for their recruitment drives: previously, they would go door-to-door to try and recruit new converts, handing out literature that explains their beliefs.However, people who have left the church have described this as being exhausting.One said: I barely got any sleep when I was a Witness...I needed the weekends to catch up on my sleep debt, but instead I had to get up at the crack of dawn to go out preaching.Followers of the religion are now more commonly found preaching outside train stations across the UK, and in London alone their volunteers give out an estimated 100,000 magazines every month.The publication, Awake!, has been running since 1919, and with a global circulation of 65 million they show no sign of stopping recruiting any time soon. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In return, they must respect what we are.Single market means single market ... There is no single market a la carte.In response to Mr Barnier’s change in stance, sterling rallied sharply against both the dollar and the euro this afternoon as the markets reacted to the decreasing chance of there being a “no deal” Brexit.His comments came just as the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was appearing in front of Lords Committee to answer questions about how the EU negotiations were going.He rejected suggestions from a Labour peer that Theresa May’s Chequers agreement amounted to “begging for a deal, saying: “I don’t beg.”And he said he was prepared to play hardball with Brussels over our £39billion “divorce payment”, suggesting the UK could choose to withhold some of it if a long-term agreement cannot be agreed.The Cabinet minister added: Im confident that a deal is within our sights. Were bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.There was a light-hearted moment when Lord Liddle’s mobile phone went off in the committee room and Mr Raab joked: Its probably someone from Brussels trying to check in on the money.He had been speaking about the UK’s plans for providing the EU with a the financial settlement, saying a “no-deal” scenario could affect arrangements over payments to the EU.Mr Raab said: The financial settlement, as its calibrated in the withdrawal agreement, reflects a whole range of considerations not just the strict legal obligations.“And if we left with no deal then not only would there be a question around quite what the shape of those financial obligations were as a matter of strict law, but secondly on the timing.Remember that the timing of payments is actually - we overlook it on our side - rather important on the EU side because of the way money is distributed.“But I dont think it could be safely assumed on anyones side that the financial settlement as has been agreed by the withdrawal agreement would then just be paid in precisely the same shape or speed or rate if there was no deal.As I said that would be a peculiar position for the UK to take because we view the package as a whole.It comes as Mr Barnier was accused of avoiding having more Brexit talks with Mr Raab because of diary issues - while also posting pictures from his holidayHe previously said he is available 24-7 for discussions with the Brexit Secretary – but the minister has complained his requests for discussions have been knocked back by Brussels.Earlier this month the pair vowed to speed up the drawn-out process of debating Theresa May’s Chequers plan with the autumn deadline for a deal looming.They said they would have “continuous talks” from then on, but today there are reports UK officials are “tearing their hair out” at the EU’s failure to live up to this promise.The two sides were due to spend this week locked in negotiations, but Mr Barnier only offered Mr Raab a three-hour slot this Friday because of his schedule commitments.It came after he tweeted an image of himself in the sunshine in eastern France on Sunday.The  reported that after complaints from the British side that has been extended to five hours, but it says diplomats have raised this issue several times.The newspaper reports that the EU commission’s claim, repeated by a spokesman on Tuesday, that Mr Barnier was available day or night has been proved to be false.Mr Raab hinted at his frustration when at a press conference last week he expressed hope for a longer meeting this week.And he also suggested a deal would require “energy on both sides”, as they admitted the October deadline for hammering out a deal had slipped to the end of the year.In response an EU official said: “The commission is working for a deal. Negotiation agendas, including meetings between principals, are decided jointly.“The aim of the meetings between the principals is to take stock of progress made at technical and coordinator level.”The Department for Exiting the European Union said: “Both the secretary of state and Michel Barnier are committed to weekly discussions to ensure that both sides get a good deal.”Responding to todays story Mr Raab said: I shall be over in Brussels tomorrow evening for a long, substantive meeting on Friday, I hope that gives you the facts directly with Michel Barnier.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Let them form their own party, we will work with them, and we’ll try and do it together.Top Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun the plotters reminded him of the Japanese officer who continued fighting WW2 until 1974.He said: They want to turn the heroic mistake of the Japanese soldier Hiroo Onoda into public policy.He spent 29 years in the jungle before recognising defeat - perhaps the Lib Dems and their friends will be in the wilderness for longer."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429208376.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside north korea pictures everyday life","story":"A country shrouded in secrecy, emerging sporadically from its inward-looking society to take over our headlines with aggression and absurdity.Admittance to the country is difficult and often impossible, but from time-to-time Western photographers are allowed in.Earlier this month Getty photographer Carl Court was granted permission to document the Communist state, following its citizens at work and at play.Families relaxing at arcades, kids swimming in water parks, women spending time at the beach and a bloke getting his haircut are just some of the intriguing snaps.Whether it is news of its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons capability or its leader Kim Jong-Uns to-and-fros with US President Donald Trump, North Korea remains fascinating.Their unknown way of life, reports of poverty and prison camps, international hostages and hostile borders make it a country that is truly unique.Even the date in North Korea is unique: it is 106, not 2018, with the country basing its calendar on Kim Il-Sungs date of birth, 15th April 1912.The country is considered the worlds only necrocracy, with North Koreans claiming they are governed by someone who is dead - Kim Il-sung himself.It is also home to the worlds biggest sport and events stadium, boasting a capacity of more 114,000. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004225921841.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm bans sale of energy drinks kids","story":"The sweeping ban will also cover higher caffeine drinks like Monster that have been blamed for suicides and will apply to all retailers.The crackdown comes after supermarket regulations prohibiting under-16s from consuming the dangerous cans was branded a failure by health chiefs.Almost a third of teens have consumed the drinks - with a quarter of 6 to 9-year-olds admitting to buying the high-sugar beverages.The government is to launch at 12-week consultation on whether to set the ban at 16 or 18.Speaking during her Africa tour, the Prime Minister Theresa May said: “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children.“It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life and I encourage everyone to put forward their views.”A Downing Street source added that on the ban that “it is a question of how, not whether we do it.”Existing industry labelling guidelines require any high caffeine drinks to carry a warning and state it is not recommended for children.But now the sale of any drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre is to be put under similar restrictions used to protect kids from fireworks and cigarettes in shops.Red Bull has more than 80mg of caffeine in a single 250ml can - putting it well within in the scope of the ban.Monster Energy which comes in 440ml cans has 140mg caffeine per serving.Ministers claim that excessive consumption of these drinks has already been linked to health issues in children like headaches, sleep problems, stomach aches and hyperactivity.And teachers claim the drinks lead to bad behaviour in the classrooms - with British adolescents consuming 50 per cent more cans than European school kids.Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: “We all have a responsibility to protect children from products that are damaging to their health and education, and we know that drinks packed to the brim with caffeine, and often sugar, are becoming a common fixture of their diet.Chief Executive of Public Health England Duncan Selbie added: “Children do not need energy drinks to get through the day – they offer nothing more than unnecessary sugar“Restricting the sale of these drinks is another bold step needed to turn the tide on childhood obesity.”The measure comes in the next wave of the Childhood Obesity Strategy, but last night sparked an angry backlash from some in Government.One senior Minister hit out last night that government policy has been reduced to “a ban a day” after electric shock dog collars and clampdowns on single use plastic.They fumed: Every day, something else banned.

It is a place he and his disciples return to when they encounter resistance in Judea.I would argue our excavations warrant at least a reconsideration of the historical value of Johns references to Cana and Jesus."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429857131.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"moment cops kick travellers out of town plagued by gypsies just hours after they moved in using legal loophole","story":"More than 50 cops were called to the popular dog walking site after around 20 caravans set up camp in Woodford Green this morning.Pictures show the officer swiftly ordering them to move on from the field next to Winston Churchills statue.The travellers were in breach of a High Court order granted to the local council in June aimed at protecting parks, school grounds and industrial estates.It came after taxpayers were forced to fork out £350,000 to clear up 52 illegal sites across the borough over the past two years.Travellers have plagued the borough and cost the council £50,000 per site by dumping asbestos.But often it can taken authorities weeks to turf them out.A spokesman for City of London Corporation, which owns the land, said: We are aware that a number of travellers set up a temporary camp on Woodford Green.Our team of staff on site responded quickly and worked closely in partnership with Redbridge Council, the politan Police and social services to move the travellers on.

She talks repeatedly of the \"opportunities\" of Brexit, of executing \"the will of the British people\" but she can never bring herself to confirm that she believes Brexit will make Britain better - or even that it is a good idea.Other politicians - I suspect fundamentally less honest politicians - would dextrously sidestep the question or  implore that \"yes! The sunlit uplands await!\".Mrs May will not.Her refusal to do so so many times must, I think, inevitably lead us to conclude that she thinks the opposite.In other words, the British prime minister - uniquely in history - is pursuing a cardinal policy in which not only does she not believe, but that she thinks could do her nation harm. Her Remainer backbenchers will see it as vindication of her pusillanimity, her Brexiters as vindication of her view that she is a Remainer in Brexiter clothing.In raw policy terms too, the picture is mixed.Theresa May wants to show that Britain has a bright future in emerging markets, like Africa. But there are four important caveats.Firstly, African trade is a tiny percentage of our exports.The three countries she has visited this week only account for \u0026#16317.5bn of our trade. Compare that with \u0026#163240bn with the EU.Even belting top-drawer trade deals or big percentage increases in trade between Britain and Africa will not fill even relatively modest gaps in reductions of European trade flow.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"African economies are growing quickly - they are diversifying, no longer reliant only on agricultural products but expanding into services and technology, too.But this is a long process.Nigeria is now Africa\u0027s biggest economy and its most populous.It is developing fast - but walk around Lagos even for half an hour and you can see profound poverty.It is a long way from becoming nearly as developed as even the least developed European state.Indeed the economy of the whole of the African continent does not - in sum - equal that of France.Our specialities of services and advanced manufacturing aren\u0027t necessarily the most important sectors for countries like Nigeria in the coming years.Moreover, its legal systems and ease of doing business are far removed from that which many British firms are accustomed, especially by comparison with the uniform regulation of the European single market. Thirdly, Britain may eventually find itself on the wrong side of future African trade negotiations.At a time when Britain is divorcing itself from an economic trade zone, many African states are trying to marry up.Regional customs zones have either been created or are in the process of creation, some of which have ambitions for a common currency and single market - not entirely dissimilar to the EU.Britain may find itself on the less powerful side of the table during any trade negotiations, with countries against which it has long thought itself dominant to.And fourthly and finally, Mrs May is not the only poacher in this reserve, far from it.There is a new global \"scramble for Africa\" - from China , the US and the EU itself.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been conducting her own parallel Africa tour this very week.The Kenyan Standard newspaper carries a cartoon today with Mrs May entering the room while President Kenyatta sat around a table playing cards with Donald Trump and President Xi of China.Kenyatta looks at the door, staring at an embarrassed May holding a binder marked \"Brexit\":"},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated17:00, 28 AUG 2018Newscaption:  News letter\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDo you want to hear about breaking news as it happens?

On Monday, 6,000 far-right protesters were involved in clashes in Chemnitz in Saxony, Germany. In Italy, the right-wing League is in government with the populist Five Star movement. The far-right Sweden Democrats could hold the balance of power after elections this autumn. It is a similar story in Hungary, Austria and Slovenia. Some fear the “great peace” – the 70-plus years of co-operation and security in Western Europe – is now under threat. The rise of the far-right has co\u0026shyincided with a decline of the centre-left. Of the 28 EU states, only six – Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece, Sweden and Slovakia – have left-wing governments. The right’s tough line on migration has played well with some of the left’s traditional supporters. Prof Matthew Goodwin, of Kent University, says: “We have centre- left parties struggling with a new agenda of terrorism, immigration and the refugee crisis.” There are fears for the future of the EU. A poll for Reuters suggests far-right parties could increase their seats in the European Parliament from 80 to 122 next year. Prof Goodwin says: “The issue of the refugee crisis is massive for the EU. If they cannot be seen to respond effectively to that issue and they cannot come up with a unified plan, that is going to cause the EU major, major problems.” So what is the current situation? HUNGARY At the vanguard of the populist surge is PM Viktor Orban. In power since 2010, he has exploited unease over immigration to whip up nationalist sentiment. He casts himself as the defender of Europe against Muslim migrants, saying “a Europe with a mixed population” has “no sense of identity”.  Hungary is now described as an “illiberal democracy” due to its suppression of free speech and political cronyism. Allies of Orban, 55, have been appointed to key positions in the courts, media and civil service. In June, a law was introduced so that anyone “facilitating illegal immigration” could face prison. Another crackdown, a swipe at billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a fierce critic of Orban, aims to curtail the activities of charities and civil rights groups. Hungary has been referred to the European Court of Justice for “non-compliance” with EU law but Brussels has done little to tackle corruption in the country and allegations that billions of euros in EU funding goes to Orban’s cronies. GERMANY The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party entered parliament for the first time in last October’s elections, winning 12.6% of the vote and more than 90 seats. Preying on fears about immigration and Islam, one of its leading figures, Alexander Gauland, 77, has talked of fighting an “invasion of foreigners”. The party has also been accused of anti-Semitism.  Traditional Conservative parties have shifted to the right to head off the threat. Angela Merkel’s government almost collapsed this year when her coalition partners the Baian-based Christian Social Union demanded a tougher line on immigration. SWEDEN The Sweden Democrats, who are anti-immigration, are now polling a record high of 20 per cent. The party, which has roots in neo-Nazi organisations, is pushing an agenda of “Swexit”, halting migration and outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to beyond Europe’s borders. Its focus on crime and immigration has found appeal among voters who previously supported the centre-left Social Democrats. It could hold the balance of power after next month’s election. POLAND The right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015 and promotes a hardline nationalist and religious agenda. The Government has alarmed the EU by taking control of state media and granting itself powers to hire and fire the previously independent judiciary.  Exploiting unease about immigration, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 69, claimed that migrants could  cause “epidemics”.    The Government made it illegal to accuse the Polish state of complicity in the Holocaust, leading to accusations  that it is trying to cover  up collaboration with  the Nazis.  AUSTRIA The anti-immigration Freedom Party was given several key cabinet posts as part of a coalition deal with the majority People’s Party. Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, the Freedom Party wants a tough line on asylum seekers and immigrants. Legislation before the Austrian parliament would force asylum seekers to hand over their mobile phones and surrender cash to pay for their upkeep. Other proposals include a ban on girls aged 10 and under from wearing headscarves at school. A leading party member caused controversy by demanding a law requiring permits for kosher meat. The Government had to reassure the Jewish community the suggestion was not official policy. BRITAIN There are fears that a failure to deliver the Brexit promised by the Leave campaign could fuel far-right tensions here. UKIP has made a mini-recovery in the polls off the back of its claim that PM Theresa May is “betraying” voters with her soft Brexit. Leader Gerard Batten has taken the party further to the right with anti-Muslim \u0026shyrhetoric, calling Islam a “death cult” and talking of an “explosion” of mosques in Europe.

If follows a ferocious engagement on Tuesday that saw vessels being rammed, emergency flares used as weapons, and bottles and rocks thrown. The French – who are banned by their own government from touching the mollusks between May and October – accuse the British of greedily hoovering up as many as they can.  Now Dimitri Rogoff, the President of the Normandy Regional Fisheries Committee, has stepped up the confrontation in a series of outspoken interviews with French media.  He said it was becoming more complicated to talk to the English because of Brexit , and that previous informal deals with ‘the looters’ were being ignored.  Mr Rogoff said: ‘This tension returns because we’ve not managed to find a satisfactory agreement with the British on the sharing of scallops.  We have two totally different flotillas. On one side are the small Norman boats, and on the other side, factory ships which come from Scotland freezing scallops on board.  This is about looting. We have been talking for years to try to share better, but we cannot do it currently.’ While previous agreements were reached informally, there were serious problems this year. The problem is that the scallop is not a species managed by Europe and subject to quotas,’ said Mr Rogoff. Each country does what it likes. And suddenly, some fishermen are concentrating on this species because it\u0027s easier and freer. The solution is to get along with your neighbours, but with the Brexit coming, it\u0027s more complicated to talk to the English.  Talking about the day when Britain officially leaves the EU next year, Mr Rogoff said: Ideally, on March 29, if Brexit is introduced, the English sailors will not be able to come because they will be excluded from the community waters, but it will also present other problems for our boats.  The confrontation on Tuesday was between around five UK boats and 40 French ones, just off the coast of Normandy. There are now fears that the British will return , and the French have pledged to do everything possible to stop them.

Kira Aldcroft, 22, had a healthy pregnancy before son Leo Aldcroft was born nine days premature on August 9. The bar worker had never experienced symptoms of genital herpes apart from thrush, which she claims nurses told her was a common side effect of being pregnant, and so did not know she was harbouring the dormant virus.  But just eight days after Leo\u0027s birth, Leo was rushed to hospital with suspected sepsis after he began to bleed from his mouth.  Leo deteriorated and was placed in an induced coma before doctors discovered Kira was carrying the Herpes HSV2 virus - a type of genital herpes - which she had unwittingly passed to her son during his delivery. Kira is now speaking out to raise awareness of the deadly virus - just days after Leo died on August 19 - and is calling for herpes tests to become obligatory for all mums-to-be.  She said: I\u0027ve always wanted to be a mum so being able to bring Leo home was just a dream come true, everything was finally perfect and everyone was happy. But as Leo was laid there in hospital with doctors and nurses surrounding him, it was a mother\u0027s worst nightmare. I was physically sick when the herpes test came back positive, as I had done everything humanly possible to give my son the best start in life. I could have contracted it before or during the pregnancy, as it can be dormant for months or years so there\u0027s no way of telling. I had no knowledge I had the virus, as there were no symptoms other than thrush, and if I had been offered a test during my pregnancy all this heartache could have been avoided. I\u0027m now urging men and women to get tested. That\u0027s my message to everyone - not just pregnant women. I hope sharing Leo\u0027s story will save other lives.  Herpes has two strains, which are both dangerous to babies as their immune systems are yet to have fully developed to fight off the virus.  Type 1 can cause cold sores , while Type 2 typically causes genital herpes, and the virus can be passed onto newborn babies during vaginal delivery.  As Leo fought for his life in hospital, medics told Kira her son\u0027s odds of surviving were dropping by the minute. Unable to hold her baby boy, Kira and her mum had to look on helplessly as doctors fought to save his life. But on the Sunday morning - just hours after he was first rushed into hospital - doctors told her his liver and kidneys were failing and that they would have to put him on a dialysis machine in order to keep him alive. Leo was then moved to a private room as Kira was told it was time to get her baby boy baptised. Soon after, Kira and her mother were given the devastating news that medical staff had found a clot and swelling on Leo\u0027s brain and that all his organs were failing. It was then that Kira decided that her brave boy had suffered enough and she made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support machines. Kira said: As Leo lay in hospital, all I wanted to do was to hold and to kiss him and to tell him that everything would be alright.  I told my baby boy to fight and that we were all on his side, and how much I loved him and wanted to return home with him. Leo\u0027s baptism was a nice moment to know I could bless him before he passed. I wanted to get him christened at Christmas, but obviously his time came a lot sooner. The consultant then told us his condition had worsened. Once I knew the status of Leo\u0027s health, I knew it was time for me as his mother to say \u0027enough is enough\u0027. Once I\u0027d decided that, I was then allowed to be next to him and be by his side. I fell asleep with my head on his incubator and held his hand and when it was time to stop the machines, they let me hold him. It was heartbreaking, as he took his last breaths in my arms, I held his hand and held him so close, and told him how proud I was of him. The doctors then left the room, and let me and my family have our time alone and a chance to say goodbye. Despite his short life, Kira is adamant her son touched the lives of everyone he met.

Some Derby residents described the pong as smelling like sick, manure, and drains. One business owner said the odour grew worse overnight and throughout the day, leaving her heaving because it was so bad. Robbie Bunting, 23, who works as a digital artist for Bloc Digital, said: “I could smell it on the way to work by the Silk Mill. It smells like the whole of town went out last night and threw up everywhere! It’s like the same smell as manure. It was really unpleasant.”  Tom Clarke, 73, said he travelled to the city centre today and told Derbyshire Live he could also smell it all the way here.   He said: “I recognise the smell from when I was in Lincolnshire, it smells just like liquid manure. “I was on the bus and could smell it from Chellaston all the way here and a lady asked me what it was - I said liquid manure. “Don’t know where they are spreading it but it smells really bad.” Many people turned to the council for answers, before Derby City Council confirmed it had not received any complaints this morning about the smell. Water company Severn Trent said: We’ve not had any reports about smells in Derby and are not aware of anything that could be causing it.

Dad Haydn Brown described the apartment they were given at Pontins Prestatyn Sands resort in Wales earlier this month as a hovel and said it was worse than a detention centre. The 38-year-old said he was then moved to another apartment which was just as filthy and claims he even had to clean up dried faeces off the floor while the bathroom was strewn with what looked like used toilet paper. Former firefighter Haydn booked the \u0026pound100 last-minute stay at the resort with carer partner Kylie Cox, 29, and children Eve, 12, Noah, 6, and one-year-old Amelia, so they could visit a sick relative living nearby.  Haydn, from Manchester, said: I\u0027ve slept in hostels all over the world and I\u0027ve stayed in some absolute hovels but this is by far the worst. I remember going to Pontins as a kid and it was always clean and tidy. It was actually a nice place to be. Not any more. The site itself was vile. There was a smell of weed blowing through the arcade and the lockers in the swimming pool area were broken. One lady was in tears saying she didn\u0027t feel safe there. We were staying for two days to visit a sick relative nearby. I\u0027d tried everywhere else but it was the only place that had spaces. We were supposed to have a ground floor apartment because of the baby but they didn\u0027t give us one of those.  The first room we went into was filthy, it was like a crack house. There were empty beer bottles, dirty nappies on the floor, takeaway containers and old cigarette packets on the sofa. I poked the takeaway packets and a load of flies came out, the smell was awful. It was really upsetting, we didn\u0027t need the stress what with visiting our poorly relative. It hadn\u0027t been professionally cleaned. We didn\u0027t even look in the other rooms, I just went straight to the manager and asked to be moved. After complaining, the family were given a different ground floor apartment but Haydn said from then on it was a \u0027comedy of errors\u0027. Haydn said: We got to that room and there was ketchup on the kitchen floor and I could actually write my name in the dirt that was on the cooker.  I went back to speak to the manager and told them the room was a mess and asked if they could send someone to clean it.    They sent a man with a dustpan and brush and a mop and bucket but no cleaning products. I asked him where his cleaning products were and he said he was going to clean it with water. I couldn\u0027t believe it, I thought it was disgraceful. We went to the restaurant and when we got back he\u0027d made a half-hearted attempt with the dust pan and brush. They didn\u0027t clean any of the kitchen, the grill pan and kettle were rusty. They told us they\u0027d cleaned it but they didn\u0027t. They cleaned the front windows and the sofa and picked up the loo roll but that was it, it was filthy. I\u0027ve spent 20 years as a firefighter and I\u0027ve come out of houses that have been on fire that have been in a better condition. Haydn said he was forced to buy his own cleaning equipment and spend four hours tackling the vile mess himself.  Haydn said: There was even a piece of old poo on the floor of the bathroom, I think it had been there a long time. I tried to scrub it up with baby wipes but it didn\u0027t work. The bedrooms were horrible. I pulled one of the beds out and you could see it had not been cleaned for a long time, there was so much dust. I even bought my own bleach and actually spent the first four hours cleaning the apartment myself. It was an absolute dump, it looked like how I expect a detention centre would. Haydn complained numerous times but said he was only given a \u0027solutions form\u0027 and told he would have to send it in the post to request a refund. Hayden said: If they would have refunded me maybe we could have found another hotel room but we had no choice but to stay there for two nights.  There were so many people in the reception area crying and getting upset. I know it\u0027s not a posh place but you expect it to be clean. One woman was saying that there was somebody else in her room, another said she couldn\u0027t stay there because she felt unsafe. She said she had a horrible time and was going to book into another hotel. None of the televisions worked. There were signs in reception saying they know there are issues with the signal and they\u0027re in the process of fixing it but you could tell those signs had been there a long time. The whole place was deteriorating.

A poll of 1,000 parents found the top concerns among those with kids starting school, with 71 per cent citing ‘settling in’ as their biggest worry. Three in 10 stress about their little ones being able to manage going to the toilet by themselves, and a fifth can’t guarantee their kids will behave all day. The research was conducted by Disney Junior’s show Vampirina, who also produced a video guide to help kids make new playmates. Psychologist Linda Blair said: “To make friends children must be able to consider life from other people’s points of view so they can appreciate and react to what others want to do and enjoy. “Although young children show they’re capable of appreciating other viewpoints, they don’t normally apply this skill until they’re about five years old.  “This is why it’s important to start introducing them to this skill at a young age. Once they can understand empathy it will feel like second nature to them to behave in those adaptive ways. “It’s natural for the whole family to feel nervous on your child’s first day at school—and remember, other parents will be feeling nervous as well. “You can help create a welcoming atmosphere by offering a genuine compliment to another parent about their child’s behaviour and/or appearance.” The research also found 70 per cent of parents cite confidence as a key quality in making friends, while 53 per cent think shared interests is the best way to make a new pal. It is not just the children that parents and s worry about, with 55 per cent saying they themselves are anxious about making new adult friends. Well over half of adults admit they lost friends as they got older, and 36 per cent confessed they wish it was as easy to make friends as an adult as it was during childhood.

David and Elizabeth Emanuel , who created her stunning wedding dress, were among her favourite designers and were often tasked with coming up with new looks for the princess.  Before Diana and Charles\u0027s tour of the Gulf states in 1986, the duo were asked to come up with a series of dresses which \u0027conformed to local customs\u0027. They came up with four demure, long-sleeved outfits and a fifth \u0027reserve\u0027 outfit - a burka that would have covered Diana from head to toe with only a gap for her eyes.  It is not believed that Diana wore a burka during the trip, but the fact she was willing to consider it shows her sensitivity to other cultures. Diana\u0027s lady-in-waiting Anne Beckwith-Smith wrote to the Emanuels explaining exactly what the princess needed from their outfits. The letter, dated June 2, 1986, said: Certain special requirements concerning dress need to be observed and I am writing to ask if it would be possible to submit to The Princess of Wales a few sketches for day and evening wear from which Her Royal Highness could select items for this tour. Their Royal highnesses will be visiting Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In all cases modesty is the order of the day.  The sketches, and fabric samples for the outfits, have now emerged for sale with US auction house RR Auctions. The collection is tipped to sell for \u0026pound24,000. . An invoice for the dresses also features in the sale revealing they cost between \u0026pound275 and \u0026pound450 each. The collection has been consigned for sale by a private collector and it is believed that this is the first time it has emerged on the market. Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auctions, said: Princess Diana tried to conform to local customs by wearing concealing clothes, but still exposed her neck and left her head uncovered.  At evening banquets, she appeared in the long sleeved demure dresses made especially for the tour. She did not have to wear the \u0027reserve outfit\u0027 burka depicted in this archive. It\u0027s a remarkable, comprehensive archive from the famously stylish royal. Diana and Charles made a whistle stop six day tour of Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in November 1986.

Sarah McGill had been facing up to 15 years behind bars, but was instead given five years\u0027 probation and ordered to leave America immediately. The ruling came after she was found guilty of lewd or lascivious battery - - known as statutory rape in the UK. As the probation was terminated upon her leaving the US, her sentence was effectively deportation. The sweetheart deal with prosecutors means that the the 28-year-old hypnotherapist, from Galashiels, Selkirkshire, could be back in Scotland as soon as today, though her travel plans are unclear.  McGill\u0027s case was unexpectedly resolved on Wednesday, three days after details of her police interviews were published in which she said she felt terrible the boy was underage. She had denied lewd or lascivious battery - which is similar to statutory rape in the UK - and was due to stand trial next month. But the prospect of a long jail term left her scared, she said in a police interview, and prosecutors were apparently willing to cut her a deal.  McGill had been due to appear before Judge Marc Lubet at the Orange County courthouse in Orlando, Florida, for a pre-trial conference on Wednesday but instead she was sentenced later that day. Julio Semino, court support manager for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, said in an email: Ms. Mcgill received 5 years sex offender probation. She was adjudicated guilty as a sex offender. Her passport was ordered to be returned to her and she was directed to immediately leave the country. Her probation is to terminate upon her leaving the US. Under Florida law, when a person is adjudicated guilty by a judge they are convicted of the crime. A note in the court calendar says: Court designates the defendant a sex offender\u0027.  McGill had been arrested on April 6 after having sex with the 14-year-old in a Courtyard Marriott in Orlando. The victim had found her profile on Quora which listed her under the name ‘Sophie Belle’ and texted her to set up the liaison for which he paid her 480 . The incident came to light when the boy\u0027s father found out what he had done and went back to the hotel where he called the police. It later emerged that the boy had lost his virginity to McGill when they slept together. The arrest shone a light on McGill\u0027s bizarre double life as she claimed to be a hypnotherapist with an office in Edinburgh. In her police interview McGill admitted she had been travelling alone across the US - visiting San Francisco, New Jersey, San Diego and Tampa before Orlando - but claimed she was sightseeing. When it was put to her that she is a prostitute who is paid hundreds of dollars an hour to sleep with men, she said there is truth in that. McGill sobbed during the two hour interview and said that I swear I didn\u0027t know the boy was under 18.  She said: We didn\u0027t just talk. He wanted to touch me. We were talking and one thing led to another. That was it. I wish that I never took him upstairs. I feel like such an idiot. McGill added in her thick Scottish accent that she didn\u0027t come here to do anything wrong. Through tears she said: Whatever happened, I never had any ill intention. I\u0027m just a very down-to-earth, normal person. I\u0027ve never been in handcuffs or anything like that so it\u0027s scary for me. I think I should leave the country and I think I should be told off. I don\u0027t want to go to jail. I\u0027m really scared.

Paul Hind, 38, wrote offensive material on the page dedicated to Hannah, from Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, who were brutally beaten to death. Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo have since been sentenced to death after being found guilty of murder. As well as trolling the page set up by loved ones in their memory, Hind, who admitted posting the material, targeted Olivia Burt, a Durham University student who died from head injuries after an incident outside a nightclub in February. He called her a sex worker and prostitute on the social media site.  South East Northumberland Magistrates\u0027 Court heard on Thursday that Hind, of Westacres in Wark, also doctored an image of the dead woman and posted pictures of children who were clearly terminally ill on her Facebook page on April 20. Hind admitted four separate offences of conveying false information which was indecent or grossly offensive, relating to four dead people.

He said the posts made him and Paula Burt, Olivia\u0027s mother, feel physically sick.

The baby, known only as \u0027Child M\u0027, is one of three of the couple\u0027s seven children to tragically die in the space of two years. A Wigan Safeguarding Children Board report reveals only four have survived longer than 16 months - and they still live with their parents. The shocking report revealed how Child M perished on the third day of the high risk family\u0027s holiday, in July 2016. It contains 11 recommendations which, if applied at the time, may have prevented the infant\u0027s potentially predictable death. The probe revealed how the parents had left three babies for six hours while they went boozing - only checking in on them occasionally. Authorities were aware mum and dad both struggled with alcohol, but early interventions were stood down as the mum refused permission for help. The tragic event unfolded during a four-day holiday, for which the parents had taken their six children to a resort just 35 miles from Wigan, Greater Manchester.  Both the mum and the dad, a violent offender released from a 30-month jail stint for robbery just before the relationship started, were known to social services. The authorities were aware of reports of potential domestic violence after the mum turned up at her nursery job with two black eyes. Staff at A\u0026ampE also reported her after she turned up drunk at the hospital when 20 weeks pregnant with her first set of twins. At the time of Child M\u0027s death, the dad was described as unsupportive and would often go off for days at a time on drinking binges. The doomed holiday included three children - all primary-school age and younger, a 13-month-old child and the 10-week-old twins. At around 10am the dad found his youngest daughter unresponsive in a baby car seat in the hotel room next to her twin sibling. Twenty minutes later the dad carried his lifeless infant down to the hotel reception where paramedics arrived after just two minutes. Paramedics noticed signs of rigor mortis, which sets in as soon as four hours after death, and the heartbreaking decision was made to discontinue resuscitation. She was pronounced dead at 11.23am. The report states: Child M\u0027s death occurred in the morning, following the second night of the family\u0027s holiday. The three youngest children were settled for the night in the attic bedroom anytime between 7pm and 7.30pm the previous evening. The twin infants were placed to sleep in their car seats which were upright on the bottom bunk bed. The parents had planned to use a sleep system which included carry cots, but this was reported to be too heavy to carry up the three sets of stairs to the attic room.  Child M\u0027s parents and their three older children then went downstairs to the hotel lounge to socialise. The parents were reported to have been checking on the three younger children every 30 minutes. Police, who later carried out a criminal investigation, were able to verify the parents had checked on their children. According to the parents, they returned to the bedroom at around 1am after drinking in the hotel bar, and Child M was fed by her mother at 2.30am. After the tragedy, blood tests were taken from the parents after police found empty cans of lager and beer bottle in the bedroom. The report revealed how the couple\u0027s both sets of twins suffered a series of health problems. Of the first set born in June 2015, one child died after three days and the other suffered from complex needs. Child M was also considered to be high risk who needed to be resuscitated at birth and weighed just 920g. She remained under the care of the Neo-Natal Outreach Team  who worked with the family to prepare for their holiday. The following review into Child M\u0027s death read: NORT members believed the children would be sleeping in \u0027carry cots\u0027. But the parents did not follow through with this original plan as they were \u0027too heavy\u0027 to carry up the three flights of stairs to the family bedroom. Describing how the family had four referrals to child social care in a 10-year period, the reviewers stated: Mother\u0027s use of alcohol was a repeated focus of concern. There was some evidence that professionals attempted to work with the parents to assess their alcohol use.

The 33-year-old dad is accused of killing his wife Shanann and girls Bella, four, and Celeste, three, at their Colorado home earlier this month.  He went on TV pleading for their safe return before their bodies were found, and then claimed to police that he had caught his wife strangling the children. But detectives rejected his story and arrested him - and it is now claimed that he showed no emotion as he had his fingerprints taken, posed for a mugshot and was put in lockup.   People magazine has said it spoke to someone who is close to the investigation into the shocking triple murder and was present when Watts was processed following his August 15 arrest.  The unnamed source gave a chilling account, saying Watts “showed no emotion the entire time. The source added: “He looked like he couldn’t be bothered by the whole thing. After police learned that Mrs Watts, 34, and the girls were missing, her husband went on a local TV station on August 14 pleading for their safe return.  He was arrested on suspicion of murder the following day. Neighbours claim his behaviour was strange amid the search for the mum and daughters. Terry Witt told People: “He didn’t seem upset at all. After reviewing the TV interview, one expert claimed Watts was showing all the traits of a psychopath, including being overtly winsome and charming.   Kim Gorgens, a clinical professor of professional psychology at the University of Denver, told Fox 31: It\u0027s not a personality characteristic that you can pick out of a lineup.  It\u0027s not like someone wears a sign that says you can\u0027t trust. In fact, it\u0027s the opposite of that. Police have said Mrs Watts, who was 15 weeks pregnant with a boy, was murdered after she returned to the family\u0027s home in Frederick, Colorado, in the early hours of August 13 following a business trip to Arizona. Detectives believe the girls may have been killed before their mum came home.  Officers went to the home on August 13 after Mrs Watts, who worked in sales for the nutritional company Le-Vel, didn\u0027t answer a friend\u0027s text messages or calls, and failed to show up for a doctor\u0027s appointment. Police went to the house, but they didn\u0027t notice any obvious signs of foul play and left. But detectives dug deeper into the disappearance and Watts quickly became their prime suspect. CCTV from a neighbour\u0027s home showed him backing his truck into his garage at 5.27am on the day his wife vanished, and then driving away. Police also learned that he was having an affair with a colleague.

Pamela Carter, 28, and her husband Rick Carter, 36, noticed what they believe to be a spirit earlier this month when a man paced down their street before seemingly disappearing into thin air. Two nights later, Pamela looked at her CCTV again and the same figure was marching ‘like Caesar’ up and down the street before disappearing once more. The hairdresser has now admitted she is so petrified she will consider moving house and claims it feels ‘eerie’ when she’s alone. Pamela, from Henderson, Kentucky, said: “I have considered moving out if things keep happening. I\u0027m very frightened.  “A couple of days before this clip, we were up really late at around 3am. Rick and I were sitting inside and I noticed something weird on the camera. “It looked like the same guy from the video. It was really faint. “I said ‘Ricky, look at that. He looks funny on the camera.’ He was just marching like Caesar down the pavement outside. Then all of a sudden he just disappeared. “He was gone and I can’t explain it. “I told Rick to rewind it and that’s when we saw him just disappear into thin air. “I went outside to look if he was up the street and no one was there.  “He didn’t walk back down because my cameras would have caught it. “I fear this man will start appearing more often.” Since the two sightings of the unexplained figure, Pamela claims she and her husband were sitting outside when they heard the sound of running from one end of their neighbours’ trailer to the other while they worked a late shift. After worriedly fetching the neighbour’s grandmother in fear of a break in, they discovered the trailer empty. The next day, Pamela’s neighbour and her girlfriend admitted to having a ghost in their trailer. Pamela said: “One night my husband and I were outside enjoying the weather when we heard something coming from inside the neighbours’ house. When you live in a trailer you hear everything.  “Our neighbours work nights and we heard someone running from one end to the other. “We went over to get the woman’s grandmother who owns their trailer and no-one was in there. “The next day, my neighbour said ‘we heard that you heard our ghost.’ “She said ‘there’s a ghost that lives in our house.’” Although Pamela has shown her children the video of the strange apparition and said it’s ‘not a big deal’, she admits she is now scared after hearing bumps in the night.  She has admitted that if the strange happenings continued, the family may be forced to move. Pamela said: “It’s been mad. Since then I’ve heard sounds in my house and stuff is being moved around. “I’ve been waking up at 3am in the morning hearing my dog growling at the back of the house. “It’s just weird. Whatever it is, I don’t want to mess with it. “I haven’t been staying up late at night anymore.

The 32-year-old woman - who appeared to have restraints around both of her wrists - is now safe and detectives believe she was the victim of domestic violence. Her 48-year-old boyfriend was found dead at home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, along with a suicide note linking him to the woman seen in the video. Police had launched a desperate search for the woman after CCTV emerged showing her ringing a doorbell while partially dressed and barefoot. There are now suggestions that he was holding her against her will and she managed to escape through a window.  The video was recorded on a home surveillance camera at 3.20am on Friday in Sunrise Ranch, Montgomery, Texas. The woman can be seen walking up to the door emerging from behind a bush, ringing the bell, then walking away. She is wearing a white t-shirt and has unknown objects, which appear to be restraints, dangling around her wrists.  An anonymous neighbour told ABC News that she rang the doorbell of several different neighbours but disappeared by the time they answered their doors. The look on her face, but she was being very very quiet… she just looked distressed, one neighbour who saw the footage told the broadcaster. After police posted the video online, local residents got in touch with speculations that she may have been abducted - pointing to missing persons in the area.  But police have since confirmed that they have identified the woman and she is safe with her family. They said she wasn\u0027t missing, but they believe she was a domestic violence victim. Officers were able to confirm the woman\u0027s safety after they were called to a suspicious shooting at a home in Sunrise Ranch at 11am on Wednesday.  Police were performing a welfare check after a friend of the woman\u0027s boyfriend had received a text message from the man, who was threatening to kill himself, ABC News reported. But it was too late by the time officers arrived at the home. The man\u0027s body was found inside from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, it was reported. Police told local media they found a suicide note linking him to the woman, who they say was his girlfriend.

Ms Jewison said the drug may have altered her sex drive and affected her state of the mind. The court also heard Hays suffered from a borderline personality disorder. Magistrate Robert Stone said there was no medical link between the drug and Hays\u0027 behaviour. The only evidence was from a psychological report completed by the defence in which some of Hays\u0027 friends observed she was off the planet after taking the drug.  Ms Jewison said Hays\u0027 crime was at the lower end of the scale but Mr Ogilvy disagreed and said she tried to get the boy to sneak out at night. Mr Ogilvy urged the magistrate to jail Hays given she was 47 when she started to send explicit messages to the teen. Mr Stone gave numerous reasons why the case could not be dealt with under mental health provisions. He said: The issue is whether proceedings will produce a better outcome for individual and the community.  I do not consider a dismissal is warranted because of the serious nature of offence. There is an issue of deterrence. In general terms, the community would expect better from people who work at school with children. Mr Stone also said he could not consider a non-custodial sentence. She knew it was inappropriate, she knew it was illegal to have sex with the boy, he said. I think it breaches the threshold, and she is not eligible for an intensive corrections order. Hays faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting, too. . .”We’ll stop there because, to be honest, classic work that it is, it does drone on for a bit.And those opening lines do, pretty much, show the ability demonstrated by the Dundee United gaffer over the opening weeks of the season.As his new team struggled to get going during a difficult Betfred Cup group campaign, Csaba was as disappointed as anyone.But he remained calm, didn’t panic and showed an understanding of the criticism that came his way from a support he knows is as desperate as he is to see the Tangerines back where they feel they belong.Most important of all, he stayed firm in his belief the changes he’s been at the centre of over the last few months were both necessary and the right ones.And while that process still has a long way to go before it’s been successfully completed, after two big Championship wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle, now there are at least concrete signs United are heading in the right direction.The success in Dumfries just over a fortnight ago brought a first three vital league points and with them a needed boost to morale.After the toils in the Betfred Cup were followed by a hugely- disappointing home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline, that something was done to lift spirits was vitally important.Having done that, last Saturday saw United seize the opportunity to send a message to the rest of their division that they can live up to their pre-season billing as one of the promotion favourites.The 3-1 win over Partick Thistle, another side expected to challenge near the top, was as convincing as could be hoped for from a side that remains in the middle of the rebuilding process.From the moment defender Paul Watson headed the first of his two goals inside the first 10 minutes, they were in control.It did take them longer than they would have liked to seal the win via Watson’s second fine header in the 78th minute but by the end Craig Curran had added a third.Over the 90 minutes they bossed the proceedings and looked every inch serious promotion contenders.As well as having some exciting attacking talent like Fraser Aird, Yannick Loemba, Craig Curran and Pavol Safranko, the team as a whole turned in a strong display.Almost as importantly, and whether conscious or not of those words written over a century before, the manager kept his head. As was the case when he didn’t panic when things were not going so well a few weeks earlier, he was not going to get carried away by this performance.He knows there is a long way to go in this most difficult of leagues and as he poetically puts it himself, there will be more stones along this rocky road.But he will stay calm and focused and, for United fans, that has to be encouraging.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b8663e0afab6-491x564.jpg ","title":"fit again striker craig curran believes dundee united are showing positive signs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStriker Craig Curran admits if he’s learned one new thing since joining Dundee United, unfortunately it is what a real dead leg is like.The man who got his first Tangerines goal in the impressive weekend victory over likely promotion rivals Partick Thistle admits he’s still feeling the “charley horse” he picked up in the final pre-season friendly almost a month-and-a-half ago.And that left him frustrated and, quite literally, out in the cold.“Now I do know what a proper dead leg is. I’ve had them before and I think they cleared in a couple of days but this one blew up double the size,” said the Liverpudlian.“I was living on the ice machine for weeks but it just wouldn’t come down. It was purely a time thing and I just had to wait. It’s still not fully healed, that’s how bad it was.“It was tough to have played all the pre-season friendlies and then get hurt in the last one. It was tough to take but it’s a long season so there will, hopefully, be plenty games for me.“Because of my injury I missed all the Betfred Cup games. That was a few competitive games, which was frustrating because I did all the work and was ready to go in them, then got the dead leg.“It was hard watching but it’s nice to be back and that was, near enough, my first full 90 minutes against Thistle so that was good.”He suffered the injury in an accidental collision in a friendly against Cowdenbeath just days before the cup action kicked off.A few other players also suffered problems around that time and it did not help the gelling process for Csaba Laszlo’s new-look squad.Curran believes that contributed to the teething problems in the opening weeks of the season but believes wins in the last two league outings have shown United are on the right path.Saturday’s 3-1 Tannadice success over the Jags was an impressive win and he reckons the team will only continue to improve in the coming weeks and months. He added: “I think it was another marker down in the league, against the side that came down with Ross County, to show where we’re at.“We obviously didn’t get off to a great start against Dunfermline in the league but you’ve seen how well we’ve bounced with two big wins in those last two games.“That’s massively important, especially at home. With the crowd and support we get it is important that we put performances on for them and get wins like this one.“I thought we controlled the game against Thistle but, look, we’re still improving and everyone has to understand that.“There are so many new players. If you look at the starting line-up on Saturday, most of them were new, apart from a couple of the boys. The fans probably still don’t know all our names there’s been so many of us coming in!“It’s important that we keep winning while we’re improving. We’ll take any win in the league, 1-0 or 4-0, but it was nice to play well against Thistle and it was good to get some goals. Everyone is gelling well and it is a good dressing-room here.”Saturday saw another recent injury victim, full-back Callum Booth, make a brief appearance near the end.With him and others returning, Curran feels the improvement will only accelerate.“It’s been some important players who have been missing. Boothy’s back now and we are still waiting on Fraser Fyvie – he is going to be a very big player for us.“Like I say, I’ve missed a large portion of the work myself and, although I’m playing again, I am still catching up with fitness and things.“The boys are heading in the right direction and we are looking for a full squad to go and get promoted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"motorists urged to avoid local road after tractor knocks out telegraph pole","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local road has been closed off by police after a tractor knocked over a telegraph pole.Officers are in attendance on Balmachie Road in Carnoustie following the incident around 4pm.No one is believed to have been injured in the crash but the pole is said to be \u0026#8220across the road\u0026#8221 near to Carnoustie High School.BT engineers are on the scene.A statement from Police Scotland read: \u0026#8220Balmachie Road is currently closed near to the High School due to a telegraph pole being across the Road having been knocked down.\u0026#8220Police are in attendance as are engineers.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed.

Whether that was for the first team, boosting sport science or towards the youth development academy.“You see what we have been able to achieve with bringing the likes of James Wilson to Aberdeen in the last couple of weeks.“It is money from DNA that has gone towards that player and bringing him to Aberdeen.“James has only had a couple of minutes on the pitch against Hibs at the weekend but I think we will start to see the fruits of his labour and the efforts of DNA in the fixtures ahead.”Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne revealed in July that AberDNA had already raised £600,000 for the first team which will be used over the course of the next 12 months.Asked if there was still DNA money to secure further signings Wicks said: “Very much so.“But it is important for people to realise that the DNA scheme is subscription based so all that money is not sitting with the club in a bank account earning interest every day.“It is subscription-based income that comes in on a monthly basis so we have to be conscious of that as things develop. We are delighted with how the scheme has rolled out and how it has been received.”Aberdeen have secured seven signings in the summer with McInnes set to add to that tally before the window shuts tomorrow.During the summer window the Reds also rejected a £3.5m bid from Celtic for Scotland international defender Scott McKenna. Did the funds generated by AberDNA put the Reds in a stronger financial position where they could knock back Celtic’s overtures?Wicks said: “To some extent.“We know Scott’s worth, we have a value in our mind.“He has demonstrated in the way he has played not only for Aberdeen but also captaining Scotland that he has an enormously bright future.“I would say it is less about DNA but more about Scott’s ability and value.“Right now he is not a player who is for sale.“The DNA funding is more there to enable us to attract players who can strengthen the squad rather than be a pot at the end of the rainbow that we can keep in reserve and knock back the likes of Celtic and anyone else who comes knocking at our door for the time being.“But we think Scott has an enormously bright future and would like to think he would be at the club for some time.”AberDNA was launched this summer with four packages that come with ious benefits – Premium , Standard , International  and Under-12 .Hearts run a similar scheme. Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5m.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Wicks said: “The manager has said how much he values the support of the fans and what they have done to secure those funds for him to use.“We look to build on that.“This is not a membership programme that is going to come and go.“It is going to grow and build.“We have only scratched the surface of number of members, particularly from an international perspective.

This is our annual survey.“But the most recent information showed we had vacancies running at about 1 to 1.5% in Scottish education.“So clearly where we have vacancies it is unacceptable but it is at

on the north-east of Scotland through the partnerships that exist in that respect.“I’m very focused on trying to identify how we can secure the additional teachers into the teaching profession and to

give a little bit more which they did. We were 1-0 up and then 2-1 down in the space of a few minutes.“It takes character to come back from that and they certainly showed it.“During the season there are always points where you need to dig in.“It can be getting a draw from a losing position or turning a draw into a win like last night.“We were pushing to get the goal and it was a fantastic move and a tremendous finish from Mitch to win it.”Inverurie boss Neil Cooper was proud of his players and said: “We had an early penalty against us which I thought was harsh.“But we came back with a good move to equalise and then got in front.“We wanted to get in at half-time but they scored just before and went in level.“Cove had the better chances in the second half with Andy Reid having a couple of very good saves.“But I can’t fault my players, their attitude was excellent and Cove are a good team.“They probably just deserved to edge it, but I can’t fault the performance the boys put in.“We want to test ourselves against the top teams like Cove and others.“We’ve still got a bit to go and players to come back from injury, but we gave a good account of ourselves.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/08/18, 1:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Well done to young Ella Pollock for recognising that she can make a difference.Something as simple as baking cakes can be all it takes to make another\u0026#8217s life a little better.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes.

Email and SMS notifications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identification. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly different in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"junior championship at lochgilphead golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/08/18, 6:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe juniors took to the course last Thursday and Friday August 9 and 10 to compete for the coveted title of Junior Champion for 2018.Day one saw Ruan McKellar finish with a fantastic gross 92, giving him an eight shot lead over his brother Kern.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

Its dual focus is to create highly engaging exhibitions and to provide a unique platform for arts education.Douglas became interested in the operation and upkeep of the vehicle itself and, as a performance artist, what acts of maintenance go into performing the narrative, social collaborations and technologies of the gallery.Using the literal mechanics of the bus to create a personalised birthday celebration, Douglas has created an entertaining exhibition which also explores bigger questions about the sustainability of the organisation.Claire Craig, curator of The Travelling Gallery said: ‘It has been hugely enjoyable, inspiring, and fitting to work with Gordon Douglas in Travelling Gallery’s 40th year.‘The exhibition continues Travelling Gallery’s excellent history of collaborating and commissioning new work by young Scottish artists, and Gordon has grabbed the opportunity with both hands and worked incredibly hard to produce work that on the surface is vibrant and playful but underneath is very intelligent and asks bigger questions about the future of our organisation.‘We can’t wait to take Black Box Take Stock on the road and celebrate our birthday with audiences across Scotland.’The Travelling Gallery will visit Lochgilphead schools on Wednesday August 29 and Thursday August 30, then will move on to Tarbert’s Templar Arts and Leisure Centre on Friday August 31 and Saturday September 1.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrating befrienders with the easy club","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 28/08/18, 2:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA group set up to encourage folk to get together, relax and have fun is hosting a special celebration.The Easy Club, based in Lochgilphead, holds regular music evenings where the format is relaxed and informal.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym.

collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment. He also enjoys the open, figureless, landscape.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"from our facebook beautiful and impressive sunflowers","story":"Below are some of their comments.Jane Wykes, from Dunoon, said: \u0026#8216Loved this on our arrival.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats Protection.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter school governance reform","story":"Deputy first minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch,Longniddry.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"nurserys outdoor play recognised","story":"Play More was set up to help deserving nurseries improve their outdoor play areas with financial support or murals.It is an initiative which was set up by nappy cream manufacturers Sudocrem to encourage parents and children to get back in touch with nature and explore the greatest playground on earth- the outdoors.As part of the campaign a survey asked 200 children, between the ages of four to eight-years-old, to identify some of the creepy crawlies in Britain.The survey revealed that nine out of 10 children were unable to recognise a butterfly even though there is an abundance of native British insects, with around 27,000 insect species calling the UK home.Moreover, 51 per cent did not know what a Bumblebee looks like.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.

She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people. That is the best way to learn what makes the school tick, the young people and the staff tick.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, East Lothian Council spokeswoman for education and children\u0026rsquos services and a Haddington ward councillor, said: \u0026ldquoI was delighted when Susan Cook was appointed as headteacher of Knox Academy.  \u0026ldquoShe brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the school from her posts in Edinburgh, which include Trinity Academy.  \u0026ldquoI welcome her to the East Lothian team and look forward to supporting her at the school as the local ward councillor."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-grammar-school-headteacher-hails-magical-community","story":"  Claire Slowther took the helm on Monday after succeeding the now-retired Paul Raffaelli, who had been headteacher for more than a decade.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy.

With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.

The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

They said CPR would be futile and unnecessarily burdensome for her.  But Mr Justice Keehan on Thursday rejected an application by hospital bosses after the woman\u0026rsquos children raised objections and said she should be given a chance to make a recovery.  He said it was too soon to make a do-not-resuscitate decision.  The judge said a time might come when CPR would not be in the woman\u0026rsquos best interests, but\u0026nbspthat stage had not yet been reached.  Mr Justice Keehan had analysed evidence at a hearing in the Court of Protection, where judges consider issues in relation to \u0026nbsppeople who lack the mental capacity to make decisions, in London.  The judge said bosses at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust had made the application.  He said neither the woman nor her location could not be identified.  Doctors told Mr Justice Keehan how the woman had lost consciousness after suffering a cardiac arrest in July.  She had been diagnosed as being in a vegetative state.  Experts said she could not be diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state until six months had passed.  Specialists overseeing her care said she was immobile and bed-bound and needed \u0026ldquo24/7 nursing care.  She could not communicate and specialists said there was no evidence that she was aware of her surroundings.  They said she opened her eyes and occasionally responded to pain.  She would remain bed-bound and specialists said it was \u0026ldquovanishingly unlikely that she would be able to live outside a \u0026ldquo24/7 nursing environment.  They also said it would be wrong if the woman\u0026rsquos life \u0026nbspended during CPR, and distressing for relatives.  But the woman\u0026rsquos children said she should be given a chance to make a recovery.  They said she held strong religious beliefs and would have wanted CPR.  An independent medical expert, not involved in treating the woman, also said it was too soon to rule out resuscitation.  Mr Justice Keehan said he understood arguments put forward by doctors caring for the woman.  But he said he had to take into account the \u0026ldquowishes and feelings the woman had previously expressed to family members.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself.

Mr Logan quoted advice from the Society of Local Authority Lawyers in Scotland  stating: \u0026ldquoSolar have advised us that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments, explaining that all children ... will participate.  However, a spokesman for Solar told The Herald the body did not provide a view to the Scottish Government on the literacy and numeracy assessments.  He said: \u0026ldquoSolar has not advised the Scottish Government that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments. Solar does not have an agreed position on this matter and has therefore not provided any formal or informal view.  \u0026ldquoTo clarify, Solar works alongside other stakeholders, including the Scottish Government, on a number of matters, but we cannot and do not provide any stakeholder with legal advice.  Last night, the Scottish Government said they had worked closely with Solar during the development of the assessments.    A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoHaving asked Solar for a view, we received a response and communicated that to directors of education in good faith.  The confusion over where the opt out advice had come from provoked a backlash from opposition politicians.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said it was \u0026ldquoutterly unacceptable for parents to have been misled and called for an apology.  He said: \u0026ldquoParents and teachers who were appalled when Mr Logan told them pupils could not opt out of these tests will be further shocked to discover the letter was based on an assertion which does not appear to be true.  Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said the government \u0026lsquos position on P1 testing was in \"utter confusion\".  She said: \"Worse still, it seems the Scottish Government has issued misinformation to the directors of education and has therefore confused matters even more. This is wholly unacceptable.\"  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Logan\u0027s letter to be withdrawn immediately.  He said: \"It is absolutely unacceptable behaviour by the government and yet another incident from blundering ministers intent on  making life difficult for parents.\"  There was also concerns from the members of a campaign set up to encourage parents in P1 to opt out of the assessments.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent organisation Connect, described the revelation as \"shocking\".  She said: \"It is very disturbing that this misinformation was used to support the government\u0026rsquos stance on standardised assessments.  \"Schools acting on this advice might find themselves in direct conflict with parents at what should be an exciting time for new P1 families.\"  Sue Palmer, chair of literacy charity Upstart Scotland, said: \"Parents have the right to withdraw their children from the P1 tests, but thanks to this strange letter many headteachers are under the impression that this right doesn\u0026rsquot exist unless there are exceptional circumstances.\"  A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said the episode was \"very concerning\" and confusing for parents and teachers.  She said: \"We fully support the right of parents to opt their children out of standardised assessments. Where parents have concerns or state a clear wish to opt their children out we would advise that parents make this known to the headteacher.\"  Jackie Brock, chief executive of Children in Scotland, said: \"There is no legal basis for insisting that P1 children be tested. There is also zero credible evidence that children will benefit from being tested at this early age.  \"It\u0027s time to call a halt to this wasteful and damaging approach, which is opposed by organisations across the education sector.\"  The government stressed that parents had no statutory right to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling - other than some parts of religious education.  The Scottish Government spokeswoman added: \"If a parent does not wish their child to take part in an aspect of teaching and learning, they can discuss this with their school. This is the same position as has existed for decades.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils with feedback highlighting cases where pupils were left distressed - particularly when whole groups were assessed together."},{"url":null,"title":"angela-haggerty-let-the-orange-lodge-step-back-but-continue-marching","story":"  It released a statement last week declaring it had fallen victim to a \u0026ldquoreligious no-go zone after it was ordered to re-route a parade away from St Alphonsus church in Glasgow, after reports last month that a priest had been attacked and parishioners heckled as they left mass during an Orange Walk. In response, Glasgow City Council insisted the lodge change the route of a later march, which was again due to pass St Alphonsus church. Unhappy with the request, the lodge cancelled the march altogether.  In its subsequent statement, the lodge said: \u0026ldquoIn order to offer concessions \u0026hellip we identified the times of the service in the church and proposed times to avoid this. All of this was rejected. We were simply told that some streets are now no-go zones based simply and horrifically on religious beliefs.  \u0026ldquoThis is religious intolerance, nothing less.  It went on to suggest an alternative approach: that the parade should be allowed to pass St Alphonsus\u0026rsquos and parishioners should all come outside to greet the march. They could all \u0026ldquowish each other well and carry on with our own lives, it said.  I must admit, I didn\u0026rsquot realise the lodge had a sideline in comedy. The notion that an Orange march passing a Catholic church, where only recently a priest was reportedly attacked in similar circumstances, could magically become an exercise in religious harmony was truly brilliant. It\u0026rsquos impressive spin, I\u0026rsquoll give it that.  If it\u0026rsquos genuinely interested in improving relations with the Catholic Church as an institution and public perceptions of it, perhaps it should consider how Catholics feel about these marches.  As a Catholic who grew up on the Isle of Bute, I hadn\u0026rsquot encountered an Orange march in the flesh until I moved to Glasgow a number of years ago. However, I\u0026rsquod met and known plenty of people who would strongly identify with the lodge, which describes itself as the \u0026ldquooldest and biggest Protestant fraternity in Scotland, and organisation of people \u0026ldquobonded together to promote the ideals of our faith.  It would be an understatement to say I did not have good experiences with those people. It was abundantly clear that I was considered inferior and problematic. These views and attitudes may not reflect how the lodge would like itself to be seen in the modern age, but there\u0026rsquos no denying it exists among its followers.  During my first summer in Glasgow, I\u0026rsquod find myself awoken at the weekends by the banging of drums and the sound of flutes. It\u0026rsquos a very odd experience to wake to the beating of a drum I felt was designed to let me know my place. As I became used to the schedule of marches, I\u0026rsquod purposely avoid certain areas. On the day of the biggest Orange march in Glasgow \u0026ndash the week before the 12th of July events in Belfast \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod avoid going out altogether or leave the city. I know many other Catholics who do the same.  On one occasion, I stepped out of the house and accidentally right into the oncoming path of a parade. I initially froze, and then in a panic, ran. Was it likely that anything untoward would happen? No. But that wasn\u0026rsquot the point. These events instil a certain fear among many Catholics. The lodge can argue until its heart is content that there\u0026rsquos no danger, but it is simply wrong to dismiss how Catholics feel about it. We are a minority in Scotland and, according to hate crime statistics, a highly targeted one.  For me, it\u0026rsquos a no-brainer that the lodge should avoid being part of the intimidating atmosphere created by marches passing Catholic churches. If it is serious about exhibiting good relations with Catholics it shouldn\u0026rsquot be calling on us to step out of churches, while fearing for our safety, to help it prove a point.  But all of that said, there\u0026rsquos an element of the lodge\u0026rsquos concerns that I do sympathise with. Amongst the debate about all of this, it\u0026rsquos clear that some of the condemnation of the lodge does not originate from a place of concern about balancing religious freedoms, but rather of religious intolerance.  I may not like Orange walks, but in principle I support the right of its members and supporters to march. The Orange Lodge is an easy target for those who do not believe the state should accommodate expressions of religious freedom. Just as they\u0026rsquod decry Orange walks, these are often the same people who would have complained that the visit of Pope Benedict to Glasgow in 2010 cost too much money and disruption to justify.  And so, to an extent I actually do share the lodge\u0026rsquos concern, and that\u0026rsquos why I hope it will step back from this ludicrous determination to march past Catholic churches. In the end, all it will be is a gift to those who really want to see the end of the lodge, and it may be surprised to find that this attitude isn\u0026rsquot coming from Catholics."},{"url":null,"title":"its-pragmatic-chequers-plan-or-no-deal-david-lidington-tells-french-business-leaders","story":"  And his Cabinet colleague Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, told a House of Lords committee that the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill through Westminster showed that Britain not only had a Unionist government but also had a \u0026ldquoUnionist parliament.  Speaking in Paris at the Mouvement des Entreprises de France conference, Mr Lidington said: \u0026ldquoWith exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission or no deal.  The Cabinet Office Minister explained that the suggested alternative models did \u0026ldquonot meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered.  \"So, Mr Lidington urged, \u0026ldquowe need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.\"  He then warned: \u0026ldquoI truly feel that we are at a fork in the road. There are trends on both sides of the Channel, both sides of the North Sea, and both sides of the Atlantic that could see us drift apart.  But the Cabinet minister also sought to allay fears within the EU27 that Britain\u0026rsquos desire to have a close relationship on goods but a looser one on services would reduce red tape for British businesses, enabling them to undercut their continental competitors, and give them a \u0026pound6 billion Brexit dividend.  \u0026ldquoOur proposals would ensure a level playing field, declared Mr Lidington, \u0026ldquowith commitments on areas like state aid, environmental, social and employment protections and other regulatory standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe understand that the EU is concerned that we could lower our standards to gain a competitive advantage but these concerns are completely unfounded. Like France, we view economic growth, consumer and worker protection and sustainable development as going together hand in hand, not as trade-offs.  At Westminster during a one-off session of the Lords EU Committee during the summer recess, Mr Raab again insisted he was confident that a deal was \u0026ldquowithin our sights.  He told peers: \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.\"  The Brexit Secretary also confirmed that the deadline for a deal, once put at the October 18/19 European Council, could \u0026ldquocreep beyond that, and slip into November.  On the Northern Irish border, he suggested there was still no agreed solution but stressed how Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, had confirmed he was open to new solutions on the backstop.  \"He has acknowledged the position could be amended or improved. What I can say is we\u0027re both committed to a solution and there is a lot of interesting, innovative technical work to make sure we resolve it,\" explained the Secretary of State.  He made clear nothing had been ruled out on the Northern Irish border.  \"We\u0027re not going to see a customs border drawn down the Irish Sea. We\u0027re not going to do anything which would imperil the Belfast Agreement. We want to make sure, in a positive sense, that the solution works for the communities on both sides,\" declared Mr Raab.  He insisted the UK had a \u0026ldquoUnionist Parliament, as indicated in the latest Westminster votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill.  \"For all the din you get around parliamentary votes, actually it was quite a good opportunity to reinforce the fact that we don\u0027t just have a Conservative and Unionist government but we also have a Unionist Parliament.  \"Because some of those amendments - in fact all the amendments - that would have risked the concern that we have around a customs border on the Irish Sea, Parliament clearly supported the Government\u0027s position.

Now the pupils at one school have voted to turn their back on their daily fashion parade after voting overwhelmingly to adopt a uniform of for the first time.  Youngsters of Westhill Academy, Aberdeen, even turned their backs on the chance to opt for a more smart-but-casual outfit of polo tops and sweaters, and instead picked formal shirts, ties and blazers for their daily attire.  The school has had a permanent \u0027come-as-you-please\u0027 dress-code since it opened 1979, but plans were made to change tack for the start of this academic year.    The pupils voted for shirts over polo tops   Alison Reid, the new head teacher at the 1,000-pupil secondary school, decided to make the switch after noticing a growing interest in uniforms among her pupils.  She said: \"I took over as head teacher in August this year, and from when I was appointed I saw there was an appetite for introducing a uniform at the school.  \"Instead of taking the decision to introduce one I decided to have a consultation which asked all the stakeholders in the school if Westhill Academy should have a uniform.  \"I thought this was a good idea as I felt like I was hearing just one side of the argument.  \"When I spoke to some of the pupils in the school their biggest concern was when they were representing the school at events and didn\u0027t seem to have an identity.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchool uniform policy \u0027creating inequality amongst children\u0027  Ms Reid added: \"The school\u0027s been open for 39 years, and we had hoodies and a dress code, but this is the first time that they\u0027ve had an actual uniform.\"  The results of the vote were decisively in favour of bringing in a smart uniform, with pupils backing the proposal by three to one.  Students were consulted throughout the process and the new uniform came into force on the first day of the new academic year last Tuesday.    Sajiyah Zahara, an S2 pupil at the school, said she thought herself and her classmates look \"a lot smarter\".  She said: \"When I found out that we were actually getting a uniform, I was quite excited.\"  Orlagh Fraser, an S6 pupil, added: \"It\u0027s definitely different, because you don\u0027t have to think about what you wear in the morning, which is definitely a good thing.\"  However, S6 pupil Shaan Singh was originally against the idea.  He said: \"I did say that I didn\u0027t want it, but after wearing it, I feel like it\u0027s better.  \"Previously I was at another school where we did have to wear a uniform and I wasn\u0027t a big fan of it.  \"When I came here we were given a bit more freedom, and I didn\u0027t want that to be taken away, but I\u0027ve come around to the idea.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchools told to ditch blazers in purge on expensive uniform  Uniforms have become a thorny issue for some families in recent years, with the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee urging schools to step back from insisting upon expensive blazers and other items when setting out their dress code in an effort to spare less-well-off families budgets.  This year Headteachers were also told to stop sending pupils home if they have missing or dirty school uniform, after a wide-ranging inquiry into the impact of poverty on education.  Yet this follows a resurgence in school uniform within the state sector, with many adopting expensive policies of the private sector such as the introduction of more formal clothing.    Each of Scotland\u0027s 32 councils are responsible for the schools in their area, and there is no national policy on uniforms.  The Scottish government said that about 120,000 families would benefit, with eligibility decided at a local level.  Annual costs for the change will be about \u0026pound12m, with costs split between government and individual councils.

At Edinburgh Waverley, less than half of services were on time. At Glasgow Queen Street, just 55.8% were.  Abellio took over the ScotRail franchise in 2015, but Scottish ministers are now putting together a public sector bid for the railways.  Last week it emerged the state-owned company behind CalMac is exploring bidding for the ScotRail franchise when it ends in 2025.  A ScotRail spokesman said it knows performance need to be better and it shares the frustration of its customers when things don\u0026rsquot go according to plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe investment we are making in new and upgraded trains, and our recruitment drive to increase the number of people working on our frontline, will help us significantly in enhancing the day-to-day running of services.  \u0026ldquoWe are building the best railway Scotland has ever had and service performance is a huge part of this delivery.

Now a campaign questioning the concern\u0026rsquos monopoly over both the Clyde and the Mersey has been endorsed by politicians from the SNP, Labour and Green parties.  Campaigners allege Peel Ports are letting key pieces of infrastructure lie idle that could help Scotland compete for shipyard and port jobs with north-west England.  Peel Ports dismiss this claim and point to investments approaching \u0026pound900m on the Clyde in the last two decades.  The row comes amid a long-standing conflict between two multi-millionaire tax exiles over one of the biggest marine assets on the British coast: Inchgreen Dry Dock in Inverclyde.  Three years ago this newspaper revealed one tycoon \u0026ndash Jim McColl of Ferguson Marine, Scotland\u0026rsquos last commercial shipbuilder\u0026ndash wanted to lease the 1000ft long facility from another, John Whittaker of Peel Ports.  The Save the Inchgreen Campaign, in a letter sent yesterday to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs and MSPs across Western Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe Inchgreen Dry Dock is being sacrificed to protect The Peel Group\u0026rsquos Investments on Merseyside.  \u0026ldquoThe Peel Group acquired vast areas of industrial land from Glasgow to Ayrshire when they bought Clydeport in 2002.

The \u0026pound1.34 billion crossing over the Firth of Forth opened to traffic on August 30 last year as a replacement for traffic using the Forth Road Bridge , coming in under budget but completed eight months later than first estimated.  Since the new bridge opened, there have been 14 occasions when the FRB would have had to close to high sided vehicles, Transport Scotland said.  On the Queensferry Crossing it typically takes around one hour to restore normal traffic conditions following an incident, compared to one to five hours on the FRB.  An Audit Scotland report published earlier this month found the Queensferry Crossing project was managed effectively and delivered value for money.  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"The recent Audit Scotland report recognised the Queensferry Crossing as having delivered its objective of providing a more reliable road link between the Lothians and Fife.  \"One year on since opening the new bridge, we are today providing further evidence that shows how reliability of journeys over the Forth have improved in the last twelve months.  \"This is in sharp contrast to the lengthy delays seen in the past on the Forth Road Bridge, where an accident or breakdown resulted in huge tailbacks and much longer journeys over the bridge and the surrounding road networks.  \"The impacts of incidents on the Queensferry Crossing have been much reduced by making use of the hard shoulders to assist in quicker response times in the recovery of vehicles and allowing for the ability to maintain two lanes of traffic.  \"There are clear and significant economic benefits from this reliable crossing for both industry and commuters alike, I am pleased to see this has been recognised by the road haulage industry today.\"  However he said the fact the contractor is still carrying out remedial and finishing work at night has an impact on those travelling outside of peak hours and has asked Transport Scotland officials to obtain an update on the work.  The road haulage industry said the new bridge has been of benefit to the Scottish economy.  Seamus Leheny, Freight Transport Association policy manager, said: \"At a time when reliable trading links across the country, and with the rest of Europe, are more critical than ever before, the Queensferry Crossing has quickly established itself as a vital component in the UK\u0027s supply chain.  \"Its ability to remain open when other options are closed by the severe weather conditions frequently experienced in this part of the world are a godsend for businesses on both sides of the border.\"  Martin Reid of the Road Haulage Association added: \"The importance of road transport to the Scottish economy and its supply chain cannot be overstated and so the Forth Crossing is a vital route to cities and major conurbations along the East Coast.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-benedetti-unveils-plan-to-expand-music-education-programme","story":"  However now Nicola Benedetti, fresh from two lauded concerts at the Edinburgh International Festival, said she is to increase and intensify her emphasis on music education.  She is to juggle new education projects with her glittering professional career beginning with a new series of masterclasses, called Super String Sessions, in four cities in Scotland next week.  An outspoken advocate of music tuition in schools, Ms Benedetti said her future plans for education works are \"if anything, way too ambitious.\"  Benedetti is to help teach 500 young people in the fundamentals, and finer points, of strings at four events in Scotland, with the Super Strings events, staffed with teachers from the Big Noise youth orchestras, in Aberdeen, Stirling, Dundee and Glasgow.  There will be more next year, and she has ambitions for more - and her educational drives will be \"formalised\" next year.  Last month, she became President of the European String Teachers Association, and is also involved in bodies such as the National Children\u0027s Orchestra, the National Youth Orchestras of Scotland and Music in Secondary Schools.  Ms Benedetti has long campaigned against cuts to instrumental teaching in schools, and earlier this year said music learning had been \"left to decay in many British schools.\"  She said: \"My plans are, if anything, way too ambitious.  \"There will be many, many more workshops, and not just for students, but for teachers too.  \"I just prioritise, and schedule it. It\u0026rsquos not easy, because different things come at different times, and it is hard to resist things that you want to do professionally, but its just really that much of a priority for me.\"  Of the Super String sessions, she said she wanted to connect with young musicians not directly in the catchment areas of the four Big Noise orchestras, for which she is a patron.  The violinist said: \u0026ldquoIt stems from a general desire from me that the expertise that Sistema Scotland [which runs the Big Noise] has built up over the last ten years is shared with more and more children.  \"It\u0027s something that I\u0026rsquove really desperate to happen more and more.\"  The increasingly uneven provision of music tuition continues to concerns her.  She said: \"That is our society: that is British society, it is an uneven one: it is not one that gives equal opportunity to all children, and that affects music - insofar as music is absolutely not taught in a high number of schools.  \u0026ldquoTo teach an instrument is hard, to teach it well is even harder, and to make sure that a teacher is equipped with what is needed to teach a child the violin - a lifetime of study is required for that.\"  Super Strings will culminate in a festival of Strings Day at the Caird Hall, Dundee on 9 October.  Ms Benedetti said she will also continue to speak out about music tuition and the value of music to children and to society.  She said: \"I think, with the exception of the post-World War Two period, money for anything that does not seem absolutely necessary and immediate is something that you constantly have to fight for.  \"I do think that some very strong arguments are being made for it in Scotland, and some of them are being won.  \"But we do hear, week in and week out, of a new council that is in danger of losing its ability to give children music lessons for free, which of course just exacerbates the difference in experience from those who have, and those have less.  \"Music and the arts, because its so difficult to quantify, because it deals with a lot of invisible things, it fits less neatly into charts and tables and statistics.  \"All of these decisions are detrimental to putting music and creativity and the arts, never mind at the heart of education, or anywhere close to a priority in education.\"  In the last year she has taught more than 1000 children in workshops, masterclasses, partnership projects, and school visits, and estimates she has met more than 100 teachers.  However Ms Benedetti does not plan to set up an educational institution, like the Yehudi Menuhin School, which she attended as a young musician.  She said: \"I don\u0027t want to lose my mobility.  \"I don\u0027t want to lose the unbiased collaborative spirit, I want to be able to be putting on workshops up and down the country, with people I can work with collaboratively, with charities, primary school teachers, and institutions of all types.\""},{"url":null,"title":"paul-sweeney-make-clyde-shipbuilding-great-again","story":"  But nearby underutilised infrastructure such as Inchgreen Dry Dock and Hunterston offer huge potential for the Clyde to expand towards large-scale shipbuilding as seen in Finland, France, Italy and Germany \u0026ndash which between them build around 90 per cent of the world\u0026rsquos complex cruise ships \u0026ndash and where average wages are actually higher than in the UK.  Those countries have succeeded in this competitive market because they viewed it as a long-term national industrial objective to patiently support investment in infrastructure and skills and they have captured the world market in the process.  Ferguson Marine is the country\u0026rsquos only remaining player in what is one of the most competitive and capital-intensive heavy industries in the world.  From dominating world shipbuilding a century ago, when the Clyde alone built more tonnage than the whole of Germany, the river today accounts for less than1% of global tonnage.  The success of the Port Glasgow shipyard is therefore critical as it is a platform from which to rebuild the country\u0026rsquos global market share and form the basis of a renaissance in commercial shipbuilding.  The two new dual fuel ferries under construction there for CalMac are crucial to this objective. The delays encountered by the yard during their construction are not unexpected due to the complexities of re-scaling the industry from near extinction just four years ago, but also because of design changes made by the customer, which have added to the cost.  In a feast and famine industry like shipbuilding, the competing pressures of maturing the ship\u0026rsquos design but also of keeping the workforce on the shop floor gainfully employed can be a difficult balancing act for shipyard managers, especially when scaling up the yard\u0026rsquos workforce from almost scratch and building what is essentially a working prototype.  Delays by the Scottish Government in signing the contract initially also added to costs, as the integrated propulsion system has been designed, manufactured and imported and has been subject to unfavourable currency fluctuations.  If we are to commit to a credible and sustainable commercial shipbuilding industry in this country, then the Scottish Government must accept that there will be risks of delays and snags as we re-learn the complex operation of large-scale shipbuilding and work collaboratively with our industry to learn those lessons.  Public sector contracts like the new CalMac ferries are an excellent way for the industry to develop the necessary resilience and efficiency in design, build, testing and commissioning vessels of this size so that it can then tender competitively around the world for contracts in the future.  The Germans Finns and Italians have shown the way. We need to do the same. We have done it before and we must now view this project at Ferguson Marine as a national mission to reinvigorate commercial shipbuilding and associated industries in Scotland.

A significant change is needed to make Scotland both more low carbon efficient and also a more resilient, desirable place to do business. Therein lies the opportunity - Scottish businesses that gain strengths in resource efficiency and environmental innovation will become increasingly valuable in global markets.  Scotland\u0026rsquos ambition is to be at the forefront of social and technological progress. In May the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced new funding to support Scottish entrepreneurs, with a \u0026pound650,000 investment into Entrepreneurial Scotland .  The Scottish Government is keen to encourage an entrepreneurial focus in Scotland\u0026rsquos future, through individuals, social enterprises and across government and the public sector.  ES is at the forefront of this movement and its strategy \u0026ndash A Vision for 2030 \u0026ndash positions the entrepreneurial virtuous cycle as a key tool for success. The cycle is a simple one \u0026ndash entrepreneurial leaders drive changes which create value for society, which are embedded in the culture and go on to inspire future entrepreneurs.  One way Scotland is engaging its entrepreneurial community is through the Saltire Fellows, the next generation of Scotland\u0026rsquos brightest entrepreneurs. They are being tasked with tackling some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time to see how that virtuous cycle can unlock Scotland\u0026rsquos potential.\u0026nbsp  Entrepreneurial Scotland has recently partnered with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency  on a Sustainable Growth Agreement to create further opportunities for environmental and social success in Scotland. Last year Fellows were set the challenge of looking into the global issue of waste tyres, with the outputs feeding directly into the forthcoming sector plan that SEPA will be consulting on soon. This year the Fellows will focus on the global issue of plastics  James Stuart, managing director of ES, believes that a cooperative approach is vital to tackle a challenge that affects every business sector. \u0026ldquoA year ago we took the opportunity to work together with SEPA, recognising that while there is much talk about the scale of the problem it\u0026rsquos much more difficult to actually engage effectively with it. This joint approach allows us to look through a different lens and bring an entrepreneurial mindset to the project    Terry A\u0026rsquoHearn, chief executive officer at SEPA, agrees that there is a real challenge. \u0026ldquoIt is estimated that if everyone lived the lifestyle of us in Scotland, we would need almost three planets. We only have one. If we are to make a shift to a one-planet lifestyle we will need massive change. Everything we do has to be reinvented and reshaped and as a species we need to become more entrepreneurial.  Scotland needs to be more innovative and more collaborative, and it needs new, and perhaps unusual, partnerships to succeed.  Stuart believes the partnership between ES and SEPA is important for success: \u0026ldquoWe have the corporate knowledge of a big team with superb expertise and SEPA brings its own particular skills with people trained to think in a particular way to address the challenge of climate change. With a united approach we can bring things into the crosshairs of where these skill sets come together.  A\u0026rsquoHearn agrees: \u0026ldquoThe scale of environmental challenges facing humanity is enormous, with a real urgency to act. Poor leaders are going to pretend it isn\u0026rsquot a problem, good leaders will face the reality of the situation. Great leaders will understand that it is an opportunity. Only those that embrace the economic opportunity of sustainable solutions to environmental challenges will thrive.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firms\u0026rsquo branch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

Mr Salmond has been heavily criticised over his decision to crowdfund his legal fight with the Scottish Government, with opposition parties accusing him of \u0026ldquoabusing his power, and dragging Scotland into the gutter.  Ms Sturgeon stressed there was an \u0026ldquoobligation not to discourage women from raising complaints.  She told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWhatever any of us do and say in the context of this very high profile case, we must absolutely make sure we don\u0026rsquot make it harder for \u0026ndash or discourage \u0026ndash women from coming forward in the future.  \u0026ldquoI think that\u0026rsquos an obligation on all of us right now. And what we should be focusing on is that fairness of process that is now important to all concerned.  Mr Salmond announced he was resigning from the SNP last night, insisting he wanted to avoid splitting the party.  He has been a member of the SNP for 45 years and its leader for 20, taking it to its greatest electoral heights and closer than ever to realising its goal of independence.  His crowdfunding appeal was set up to cover the costs of taking the Scottish Government to court to challenge its handling of the complaints, and has already smashed its target of \u0026pound50,000. By 2pm on Thursday, it had raised almost \u0026pound80,000.  But opposition figures criticised the fundraiser as \u0026ldquoastonishing, and suggested Mr Salmond was \u0026ldquosending a signal to those who have made allegations that he has the upper hand.  Former Labour first minister Jack McConnell was among those who urged people to donate to charities helping victims of sexual assault and harassment. Other Labour figures\u0026nbspcalled on supporters to donate to Women\u0026rsquos Aid.  In what some interpreted as a coded rebuke to Mr Salmond, Ms Sturgeon also tweeted her support for the Women\u0026rsquos Aid fundraiser on Thursday afternoon.  Ms Sturgeon previously said she felt a \u0026ldquohuge sadness and called the situation \u0026ldquoincredibly difficult both for the party and for the women who had complained about Mr Salmond.  She also restated her conviction that the complaints against him \u0026ldquomust be investigated without fear or favour and said independence was \u0026ldquobigger than any one individual.  Mr Salmond, 63, has started a judicial review at the Court of Session, arguing he was denied a fair chance to respond to the claims against him while being investigated by civil servants.  He said the costs would be \u0026ldquohuge and all sums received would go to his legal action, with anything left over going to good causes.  It comes after two civil servants complained about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos behaviour while he was first minister, accusing him of sexual misconduct.  Police are examining the allegations, which Mr Salmond strenuously denies.  Earlier this week, he wrote to Scotland\u0027s top civil servant, calling for an inquiry into how the allegations against him were made public.  \"In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants,\" Mr Salmond said in the message.  \"It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sse-and-npower-merger-provisionally-cleared-by-regulator","story":"  The Competition and Markets Authority  had raised concerns that the tie-up could reduce competition in the market, which would likely lead to higher prices.  A watchdog investigation found that the two firms did not compete closely for customers on default tariffs which most people are on. Few people switched between the pair, it added.  The merger would see SSE and Npower\u0027s parent company, Germany\u0027s Innogy, merge their household energy supply and services business in Britain, turning the Big Six energy suppliers into five.  The CMA had been carrying out a review into the proposed tie-up amid fears it would weaken competition in the market.

The group is calling on her supporters to lobby new Immigration Minister David Coleman to allow her into Australia.  Ms Manning was an intelligence analyst for the US Army when she leaked military and diplomatic documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.  She served seven years of a 35-year sentence before then-President Barack Obama granted her clemency in 2017.  The transgender activist, who recently lost a long-shot bid for a US Senate seat in Maryland, is scheduled to speak at the Sydney Opera House on Sunday and has subsequent events in Australia and New Zealand.  The Department of Home Affairs said while it does not comment on individual cases, all non-citizens entering Australia must meet character requirements set out in the Migration Act.  The reasons a person might fail the character test include a criminal record or a determination they might be a risk to the community, according to the department.  Labour foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong said the government should be transparent about the reasons, if Ms Manning is denied entry.  Amnesty International accused the government of trying to silence Ms Manning.  \"By refusing her entry, the Australian government would send a chilling message that freedom of speech is not valued by our government,\" the organisation\u0027s national director Claire Mallinson said in a statement.

The EIS and other unions are campaigning for a 10 per cent pay increase for teachers through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers  - which brings together union, councils and the Scottish Government.  However, Cosla, the umbrella body for local authorities, is arguing  teachers should be offered a three per cent rise in line with other council workers - describing the offer in March as \u0026ldquobest and final.  Local authorities argue offering a higher sum to teachers would break the traditional practice of offering all council workers the same amount.  However, Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said teachers were being used as a \u0026ldquopolitical pawn in a wider public funding dispute.  In a letter Cosla\u0026rsquos leadership group he said: \u0026ldquoI am writing to express the frustration of Scottish teachers at Cosla\u0026rsquos continuing procrastination in terms of this year\u0026rsquos pay negotiations and, also, to express our growing anger at Cosla\u0026rsquos attempt to use the plight of teachers as a political pawn in its own dispute with Scottish Government.  \u0026ldquoThe EIS is very clear that we have distinct bargaining machinery in the tripartite arrangement of the SNCT.  \u0026ldquoCosla needs to respect the integrity of the SNCT negotiating machinery and support a pay settlement for teachers that will address the problems of recruitment and retention, highlighted in our submission.

An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month. Over a four-week period and 63 cows, this will result in 11 tonnes less of fodder supplies used. While, focus farmer Jim Gammie reported success using woodchips over the last two years, which he is also composting for further land use.Those interested in finding out more or getting involved in a focus group, are invited to get in touch with Declan or Robert on 01467 623 838 or farmprofit@anmgroup, or by stopping by the Farm Profit Programme office located in the concourse at Thainstone Centre.

The Garioch Partnership had applied for a Community Asset Transfer in a bid to transform the Market Place School building into a third sector hub.                                                    However after discussing the plan at a meeting of the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday, August 28, councillors decided to refuse the application.                                                    During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.                                                    He also suggested that supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed in order to keep prices down.                                                    Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.                                                                                                        He said: “The vast majority of output is supplied south of the border to national supermarkets who value the quality of Scottish produce.“A fully integrated UK market is essential to Scottish farming. This year more than any other shows how important food security is and the opportunity for Scottish growers to displace imports.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"strong prices at thainstone collective sale","story":"        Over 2,000 buyers and sellers attended the latest collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment at Thainstone.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide iety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information. Also, you can check out the Children\u0026rsquos Panel website where you will find more information which should help you decide if volunteering for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel is really for you.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 30, 2018 at 4:48 pmHow do you successfully deliver a seven-day international sporting extravaganza involving 13 sports and 2,000 athletes?

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

Scottish politics has been gripped by the news that Alex Salmond is being investigated amid accusations of sexual misconduct made in January this year against the former First Minister.                The two-time SNP leader has strenuously denied the allegations, and says he completely rejects ‘any suggestion of criminality’.             He is taking the Scottish Government to court after lodging plans for a judicial review on how the Government has handled the complaints against him, and the process by which they were reported.             READ MORE: Alex Salmond resigns from the SNP following harassment claimsMr Salmond has launched a crowdfunder appealing for help with his legal fees, which has reached over £80,000 in less than 24 hours as the case prepares to work its way through the court. Here are the main facts as the story continues to dominate the agenda. Allegations It was reported late last Thursday night that Alex Salmond had been accused of sexual misconduct towards two employees who had made complaints earlier this year.             Mr Salmond revealed the complaints  ahead of an expected statement from the Scottish Government’s Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans that was to confirm the investigation. Details of the allegation were subsequently published this weekend, with reports that one woman had alleged that Mr Salmond touched her breasts and bottom following an engagement at Bute House. Salmond ResponseThe former First Minister has denied the allegations and hit out at the complaints procedure he was investigated under in a trio of statements and a broadcast interview in which he said he had ‘made mistakes in his public and personal lives, but had never sexually harassed anyone’.            READ MORE: Alex Salmond hits crowdfunding target within hoursMr Salmond has started a Judicial Review into the matter, and has continually accused Leslie Evans of handling the complaints unfairly, while also slamming leaks that he insists add to the unfairness. Nicola Sturgeon hits backMs Sturgeon has vowed to stand behind her Permanent Secretary, and says that the Scottish Government will vigorously defend its position in court, while revealing that she and Mr Salmond had discussed the allegations. She said in her initial statement: “This focus on process cannot deflect from the fact that complaints were made that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.”            Opposition questions The opposition parties have been quick to ask the First Minister to clear up what they consider to be unanswered questions over what the Scottish Government knew and when. Those questions have led to clarification from the Scottish Government that no complaints were received about Mr Salmond before this January, but Labour have put in a Freedom of Information  request to determine what was discussed at three meetings that Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon had while the investigation into the former’s behaviour was ongoing. Resignation After a few days of relative quiet, Mr Salmond made two significant announcements in a video statement released on Wednesday evening. The former MP and MSP announced that after 40 years of near-uninterrupted membership, he had resigned from the SNP, a party he was seen as ubiquitous with for decades. Nicola Sturgeon said that she was saddened by the resignation, which Mr Salmond said he had submitted to head off opposition attacks on his successor. ‘Unbelievable Crowdfunder’ The second piece of news that Mr Salmond announced in his Youtube video was that he had started a crowdfunding campaign to help support him with legal costs throughout his judicial review. At the time of writing, the crowdfunder had smashed its initial £50,000 and is currently sitting at £82,000 and attracting hundreds of backers, including MSP Colin Beattie. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: “Decent people will rightly be furious that he is to raise money to take the Scottish Government to court. Alex Salmond is abusing his power, and dragging Scotland into the gutter.”The futureNicola Sturgeon says she will remain restricted in what she can say about the case, while Mr Salmond is continuing to garner support among sections of the party he once led but has now left. Ms Sturgeon was urged to clamp down on her MPs and MSPs sharing conspiracy theories about the allegations by opposition politicians earlier today. The legal case has officially begun with legal papers lodged at the Court of Session. As for the political fallout - that looks set to continue."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4791980.1535634662!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond sturgeon told to address conspiracy theories with snp politicians","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Ms Sturgeon is set to address a meeting of her MPs and MSPs tomorrow for the first time since allegations emerged about Mr Salmond’s behaviour.             The former First Minister is in the process of taking the Scottish Government to court over its handling of a pair of complaints made this year about Mr Salmond.

The Western Isles MP shared a tweet which said ‘I’m backing Alex Salmond’ and suggested the British establishment was behind the accusation.             He also retweeted a Twitter user who said: “I’m not using the term ‘Scottish Government’ until its clarified who is in charge - Leslie Evans  or Nicola Sturgeon.”READ MORE: Alex Salmond accused of ‘abusing his power’ over crowdfundingLabour MSP Rhoda Grant told the Herald: “A clear message should go to SNP parliamentarians that sharing and propagating conspiracy theories around the Alex Salmond case is harmful for all involved.“The First Minister has clearly stated that sexual harassment will not be tolerated and victims should come forward - however there are members of her party indulging in victim blaming which is totally unacceptable.”            A Scottish Tory spokesman said: “Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt feel obliged to answer the many questions her MSPs and MPs will have about what her government knew about such allegations, and when.“It’s therefore vitally important she is equally transparent with the people of Scotland, who deserve and expect answers about this very serious matter.”An SNP spokesperson said: “The SNP will keep a firm focus on how to build a fairer, more prosperous country, how we hold a dangerous, Brexit-obsessed Tory party to account at Westminster and how we drive Scotland towards independence.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

In my role as Deputy First Minister, I spend a lot of time talking about all of the different work the Scottish Government is doing to try and make this ambition a reality.            We regularly talk about what we are doing to make Scotland better for our young people. But what we do not talk about enough is how our young people are making Scotland better. We as a nation should be proud of their achievements, no more so than in this, the Year of Young People. Designed to do exactly that, the YOYP shines a spotlight on the contributions and success of some of our youngest citizens. And there is no mistaking the valuable contribution our young people make through youth organisations like the Boys’ Brigade. This year I have been invited to give the keynote address at their annual conference, and I have to admit to being extremely honoured, especially as a former member myself. The conference will see thousands of members from across the United Kingdom and Ireland return to the place where it all began, Scotland, to celebrate the 135-year anniversary of the Boys’ Brigade. Founded in Glasgow in 1883, the organisation has come a long way but still remains true to its core values and aims.             In Scotland, they remain active in more than 400 communities and each week around 20,000 young people take part in one of their many groups across the country.Involvement in organisations like this can be extremely empowering, offering developmental opportunities as well as the power to make decisions, take responsibility and make a real and lasting contribution to Scotland, both socially and economically.READ MORE: Boys’ Brigade book is pal’s promise fulfilledAnd we know that youth work can have an incredibly valuable influence on the life chances of young people, which is why the Scottish Government remains committed to supporting and improving the opportunities available in a iety of organisations through our national Youth Work Strategy.            The defining mission of this government is to improve the education and life chances of our children and young people.Every child growing up in Scotland, regardless of their background, should have an equal chance to succeed.The poverty-related attainment gap that so disproportionately affects young people’s outcomes is a complete waste of potential and talent – it has to end. I have also been clear that closing the attainment gap requires a collective effort. Involvement with groups like the Boys’ Brigade plays an extremely important role in supporting attainment and achievement and developing crucial skills for life, work and lifelong learning. I know from personal experience that the memories you make and the skills you learn during your time in youth organisations like this stay with you for a lifetime.            It means discovering more about yourself and helping you to challenge what you are capable of. Equally it means discovering more about your community and the world around you, something I think we could all benefit from doing more. READ MORE: John Swinney: The evidence shows Scottish education is first classThere is more we can do though. It is not enough to simply learn about your community, we want young people to be engaged, to have their voices heard and help shape the world they live in. This is an extremely special annual conference for the Boys’ Brigade this year.It is the very first one that has been entirely led by the young people involved, from planning, ideas and decision making.Scotland is leading the way on youth engagement. Our Year of Young People 2018 is a world first and I am extremely pleased to see youth groups like this one embracing the spirit behind it wholeheartedly.I have been lucky enough to participate in the Boys’ Brigade in a number of different ways over the years and I have a lot of happy memories.  I have gone from being a member myself, to attending and handing out awards at presentations across Scotland, where I am constantly impressed by the passion and commitment demonstrated by the young people I meet.  For me, it was a particular pleasure to be able to present the Queen’s Badge – the highest award a young person can achieve in the Boys’ Brigade. It is the culmination of two years of hard work including volunteering, sporting development and expeditions amongst other things and I still remember clearly the day I received mine.Of course, none of the incredible achievements the Boys’ Brigade, or indeed many youth work organisations around the country, would be possible without the fantastic contributions our volunteers make.Thanks to the talents and skill of thousands of volunteers, our young people are supported and encouraged to be the best they can be. I would like to thank everyone who chooses to give up their time to support our young people through groups like this.Figures show that 80 per cent of learning takes place outside of school. We want to make sure that, wherever children and young people are receiving the skills they need to succeed in life they are getting the best possible support when doing so. The most effective work goes beyond the school gates and into the local community. The true breadth of education in Scotland does not start and end in the classroom.The Year of Young People is all about inspiring our nation through our young people’s ideas, attitudes and ambitions. A year specifically focusing on its country’s young people is a global first and something we can all be rightly proud of. But the work our youth organisations like the Boys’ Brigade do, year in and year out, is something we can be proud of every day and every year, both now and for generations to come.

Britain’s competition watchdog has provisionally cleared the deal which would reduce the Big Six energy suppliers to just five.            The Competition and Markets Authority  dismissed fears that the tie-up would have an impact on the most expensive deals as its inquiry found the providers do not compete closely on standard iable tariffs .            There had been initial concerns that the proposed merger would affect these tariffs – the most common and expensive energy deals.Anne Lambert, chairwoman of the inquiry group at the CMA, said: “With more than 70 energy companies out there, we have found that there is plenty of choice when people shop around.“But many people don’t shop around for their energy. So, we carefully scrutinised this deal, in particular how it would impact people who pay the more expensive standard iable prices.“Our analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.”SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: “Following a thorough and in-depth investigation, we are pleased the CMA has provisionally concluded that the proposed merger of SSE Energy Services and Npower does not raise competition concerns.            “The scale and pace of change in the GB energy market continues to be significant and requires us to evolve to stay relevant, competitive and sustainable.“We look forward to continuing to engage with the CMA as it prepares its final report ahead of the statutory deadline in October.”SSE and Npower announced in November that their UK household energy supply and services businesses would join forces.Under the deal, the new company would be listed on the London Stock Exchange with SSE shareholders holding 65.6 per cent and Npower owner Innogy holding 34.4 per cent.            SSE is Britain’s second biggest energy supplier and the merged group will serve some 11.5 million customers.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

It was installed in 1970 and we have to ensure that we can continue to provide clean, safe, fresh drinking water to our customers locally in the years ahead.\"\nWhile just a trickle of villagers attended the four-hour drop-in session, the development team considered it a fair proportion of the local population, especially as the community council was represented during the consultation exercise.\n\"The feedback so far has been good and very useful and we have discussed ious questions and concerns and the process is now under way.\"\nOne of the early callers to study the plans was former community council chairman Bill Carr, who told the Strathy: \"While larger than the current plant, the new buildings do look more \u0027integrated\u0027 and assuming the old site is cleared and landscaped \u0026ndash as they say it will be \u0026ndash this should be good news for Dalwhinnie.\n\"It will be especially good news if there\u0027s some tree-planting around the new works.\n\"And the community could possibly acquire the old site as a village resource. A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nThursday 30 Aug 2018 5:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

state of emergency \"reserve\" funds of only \u0026pound8 million, warning there were \"no more rabbits to be pulled from hats\" to solve the problem.\nPolitical rivals then locked horns in an unprecedented clash in the chamber at Inverness headquarters.\nLiberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed successive Scottish Government grant cuts for the council\u0026rsquos financial woes.\nSNP city

surprised by the scale of projected overspend. To put things into context, he said \u0026pound5.1 million equated to only one per cent of the total budget.\nBut he added: \"I have no more rabbits to pull out of the hat to help. We\u0026rsquove looked at a lot of the opportunities for the council and there is nothing else there, so there is no doubt there\u0026rsquos some really challenging, underlying issues that need to be addressed as part of that process.\"\nHe said a comprehensive update on the budget would be presented to next week\u0026rsquos full council meeting.\n\"It does require immediate correction to normal business,\" Mr Yule added. \"The council really needs to challenge what the money is being spent on to make sure it\u0026rsquos being used as effectively as possible.\"\nDefending the administration\u0026rsquos handling of the finances, budget leader Alister Mackinnon said a process of \"robust monitoring\" would mean a monthly update from all departments from now on.\nHe pledged transparency but conceded the current position was \"a wake-up call for all of us\".\nCllr Adam cited a \"2.7 per cent\" UK government grant cut and an \"eight per cent\" grant cut from Scottish Government.\nAnd he said the reduction was worse for Highland, not least because of the high cost of safeguarding a costly portfolio of small schools in remote areas.\nCouncil leader Margaret Davidson claimed that \"local government and the services we deliver are not a priority for the Scottish Government\".\nCllr Laird insisted the crisis was \"entirely of this council\u0026rsquos making\".\nHe accused administration members of failing to read the budget proposals early enough to understand the implications and then, realising car park charges and toilet closures were among them, \"they ran away from it\".\nCllr Mackinnon accused the SNP opposition group of failing to present alternative measures as part of the budget process and has since failed to join a debate on the issues.\nHe said he had offered meetings to group leader Maxine Smith but had been turned down \"because she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her own diary\".\nThe comment incensed SNP councillors. Cllr Smith was not in the chamber to respond.\nSNP group finance spokesman Ian Cockburn rose to his feet, accusing the budget leader of being \"out of order\" with his attack.\nCllr Mackinnon ordered him to sit down, insisting that he was chairing the meeting.\n\"You\u0026rsquove had umpteen opportunities to come back to discuss alternative savings with us, and to date you have not taken advantage of that,\" he said.\nIn a statement, Cllr Smith later said: \"Late afternoon on Friday I received a meeting request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget.\n\"Of course I already had commitments but they weren\u0026rsquot \u0026lsquopersonal\u0026rsquo although even if they were it\u0026rsquos none of his business.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  has been delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

The results are amazing and they have clearly drawn inspiration from a iety of sources.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I would like to congratulate all our finalists, Andrew Moore, James Magennis and Charles Leathem, who have each taken some of our iconic packaging and transformed it into a catwalk sensation, showcasing the raw talent of some of our stars of the future.”\n\nClaire Concannon, course co-ordinator from Belfast politan College, added: “Working with crisp packaging has been a very valuable learning experience for our ingenious students who have more than risen to the challenge. The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks. The company remains family-owned by the Hutchinsons and is now run by Thomas’s children. Since its beginnings more than 60 years ago, Tayto has grown into an international business, supplying crisps and snacks produced in Tandragee to more than 40 countries across the world.\n\nDuring the last 12 years, Tayto has acquired iconic crisp and snack brands, Golden Wonder, Real Crisps, Mr Porky, Jonathan Crisp and Portlebay Popcorn through its parent organisation Tayto Group. Across the Group, more than five million packets of crisps and snacks are produced each day at its six UK factories.

\n            \n\nPrincipal Mrs A McCullough said the results reward the hard work of the pupils, the dedication of the staff and very positive parental support. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It is also important to recognise the contribution of our partners in the Banbridge Area Learning Community, “ she said. “This partnership allows us to offer a diverse range of subjects which affords pupils a wider choice at KS4.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“This year’s set of results reinforces our reputation as a high performing, non-selective secondary school. \n\n“Rathfriland High School has provided opportunities and opened doors across a diverse range of further education and training which will allow these leavers to choose whichever pathway most suits their skills and talents. \n\n“I would like to congratulate our pupils on their success, perseverance and industry. \n\n“I would also pay tribute to the talented and professional teaching staff who play a pivotal role in these achievements.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Parents also provide crucial

Championships clicked into gear at the weekend with a mixed bag of results for city teams.\nIn the Bathshack Antrim Senior Hurling Championship, St John’s booked their place in Group Two alongside Rossa and Loughgiel as they defeated Ballycastle 2-21 to 2-13at Corrigan Park in their second leg tie to win 59-37 on aggregate.\nThe Johnnies wasted no time in adding to their 14-point pre-game lead when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home by a point, 0-18 to 0-17.\n\nIntermediate Hurling Championship\nIn the Intermediate Hurling Championship, St Gall’s withstood three red cards to overcome Gort na Móna 4-10 to 2-11 on Sunday afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex O’Boyle with their two goals.\nThere was no let-up from Oisin’s after the break as they piled on the scores and O’Boyle completed his hat-trick of goals to run out convincing winners.\n\nJunior Football Championship\nIn the Junior Football Championship on Friday, last year’s beaten finalists, St Patrick’s, Lisbirn eased to a 3-13 to 0-3 over Éire Óg at the Cricky.\nThe Lisburn men were well on top and were 0-9 to 0-1 ahead at the break with Eoin Fay, Shane McEvoy and Josh McMullan catching the eye.\nMcMullan fisted home a goal early in the second period with Denver Taggart adding a second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the start with goals from Conaill Campbell and Daniel Magee and while Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh netter just before the break, Pearse’s still held a healthy 2-9 to 1-2 lead.\nThe New Lodge men kept driving forward in the second half and a third goal arrived from Liam Deegan from the penalty spot to wrap up their victory and place in the last eight.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"passengers can use glider from today","story":"\nMEMBERS of the public will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

Water from the River Lagan was used to douse the flames.\n\nMr Jennings described the conditions facing firefighters as \"very difficult\" with \"extreme\" temperatures.\n\n\"On a number of occasions we had to withdraw fire crews from the concrete stairs due to the collapses inside the building causing heat,\" he said.\n\n\"This has been very much a team effort, not just with fire crew but all agencies.\"\n\nFirefighters are continuing to deal with hot spots and areas of rubble, stock and timber burning under the collapsed structures.\n\nNIFRS said that the exterior of the building \"remains structurally intact\" but that it was working with engineers to \"determine the structural integrity and safety of the building\".\n\nDescribing the incident as \"ongoing\", it added that operations were \"expected to be scaled back to three fire appliances\" last night. \n\n\"There continue to be small pockets of fire within the building and a 45-metre exclusion zone remains in place,\" NIFRS added.\n\n\"There has been structural collapse within the building today.\n\n\"The exterior of the building remains structurally intact. \n\n\"We are continuing to work closely with engineers from Belfast City Council to determine the structural integrity and safety of the building. Once this has been completed a fire investigation will commence into the cause.\n\n\"In conjunction with our partners in Belfast City Council and the PSNI we have been facilitating escorted access for business owners in the local area who are affected by the incident to enable them to access and secure their properties.\"\n\nNIFRS confirmed that the building had a sprinkler system, but added that \"fire investigation will determine if the sprinkler system was activated and whether this would have had any impact on such an aggressive fire\".\n\nIt added: \"Building regulations define whether commercial premises are required to have a sprinkler system fitted. This is determined by the premises type and the size of the floor or compartment area.\"\n\nThe USDAW union, which represents Primark workers, said it had met the company yesterday.\n\nIt confirmed that all staff will be paid up until the end of the week.\n\nUnion area organiser Michala Lafferty said that further discussions will take place over the next few days to agree what happens next.\n\nShe said: \"Our members are extremely distressed and concerned as they now enter a period of uncertainty.\n\n\"The company has reassured me that the welfare and job security of the staff is their priority.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup received more than 200000 in public funds in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts two lanes of","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

It should be closed down.\" \n\nIt comes ahead of the resumption next week of the public consultation into the failure of the botched green energy scheme, when former enterprise minister Jonathan Bell will appear before the body.\n\nDubbed the \u0027Cash for Ash\u0027, the controversial scheme saw participants receive more money in payments than they paid out for fuel.\n\nEntry into the scheme was ended after the scandal broke, but public money has been committed to ensure those already signed up to the scheme will continue to receive lucrative payments for the next two decades.\n\nThursday\u0027s statement from Sinn Fein comes ahead of the end of a consultation on the future of the scheme, which has ran since June and is set to end on September 6.\n\nAs part of it the public has been asked to respond to a number of questions, including about their support for voluntary or compulsory buy-outs of the scheme.\n\n\n\n\nArlene Foster tells RHI inquiry \u0027I didn\u0027t do anything wrong\u0027 - how ex-minister\u0027s first appearance unfolded\n\n\n\n\nThe testimony in front of the public inquiry from Jonathan Bell has been long-anticipated due to his former role as minister for enterprise, and a controversial interview he gave to BBC\u0027s Nolan Show in December 2016 in which he said he would tell the truth about the scheme and alleged DUP advisers had delayed his plans to close the scheme.\n\nFollowing his appearance he was suspended from the party for speaking to the press without permission.\n\nArlene Foster is also set to appear before the inquiry again in the coming weeks.\n\nDuring her first appearance before the inquiry in April, Mrs Foster - who was enterprise minister at the time the scheme was launched - denied wrongdoing and defended her role.\n\nThe RHI scheme was the catalyst for the collapse of the Stormont Executive in January 2017, after the resignation of former First Minister Martin McGuinness.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"small number of northern ireland women referred for further investigation following cervical smear recall","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Those who haven\u0027t had a repeat test have either chosen not to take up the offer, or have an identified reason for why a test is not appropriate for them at this time.\n\n\"As expected, the majority of results of the repeat tests have been reported as normal.  A very small number of women have been referred to colposcopy for further investigation. \n\n\"The PHA and HSCB are unable to release specific numbers or further details to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"flanagan opens new garda hq in dublin","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Higgins himself or his successor, be inaugurated at the first opportunity, that will be the 11th November.\n\n“I believe however, it is possible to be inaugurated early in the day and the first role and function of the new president will be to engage on behalf of the state at the 11th November commemorations.”\n\nHe said the President could have a busy first day in office, adding: “This is an issue that has arisen by accident rather than design.\n\n“However I think it’s possible for president Higgins or his successor to have a very busy day on the 11th November, be in inaugurated into the institution of president and then perform the important official function of the World War One commemoration.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Local Government Minister Eoghan Murphy ordered the election be held on October 26.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein calls for end to sorry episode of renewable heating scheme","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

RHI should not continue in any form after March 2019 because it is not effective in reducing carbon emissions. \n#RHI\n \npic.twitter/ChZcoM9fC0\n\n— Sinn Féin  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAn ensuing political row saw Sinn Fein apportion blame to the DUP, whose leader Arlene Foster was minister at the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment when the scheme was introduced to Northern Ireland.\n\nFormer deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned from his position in January 2017, effectively collapsing the Northern Ireland Assembly, in protest at the DUP’s “handling” of the scheme.\n\nHow the scheme went so wrong is currently being examined by an independent inquiry.\n\nThe RHI scheme continues to run with more cost controls.\n\nThe Department for the Economy ran a public consultation in June over the long-term future of the RHI scheme.\n\nBut Sinn Fein says in its response to the consultation that the RHI scheme should not continue in any form, arguing it is not effective in reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAppearing at a press conference at Stormont on Thursday, Mr Murphy, flanked by party colleagues Mairtin O Muilleoir and Caoimhe Archibald, said they believe even with more cost controls, the scheme remains vulnerable to abuse.\n\n\nSinn Féin’s Conor Murphy says the continuation of the RHI scheme can no longer be justified and says it should be closed down \n#RHI\n \n#Stormont\n \npic.twitter/VMelLk3xLl\n\n— Rebecca Black  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Murphy said the funding for the RHI scheme should be redirected into another scheme that would be more effective in cutting carbon emissions.\n\n“RHI is not a good scheme that went wrong, it was a bad scheme that was made even worse,” Mr Murphy said.\n\n“We are now aware that before the RHI scheme was set up, a report commissioned by the department showed that compared to an alternative scheme, this scheme was less effective in reducing carbon emissions and nearly £200 million more expensive.\n\n“Despite this evidence the minister then responsible, Arlene Foster, opted for the less effective, more expensive option of RHI.\n\n“The original error of establishing RHI was then compounded by incompetent design.”\n\n\n\nThe RHI scheme is fundamentally flawed and should be closed down\nSinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Murphy said his party believes if continued there is a risk that the scheme could be abused in the future, and says it should be shut down.\n\n“Spending more public money on a scheme that is at best ineffective, and at worst counter productive to the goal of carbon reduction, cannot in our view be justified,” he said.\n\n“The RHI scheme is fundamentally flawed and should be closed down.\n\n“The money saved from RHI should be invested in a new scheme that is actually effective at reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change which was the original intention of this sorry episode.”\n\nThe RHI inquiry remains ongoing at Stormont.\n\nIt was ordered by then finance minister Mairtin O Muilleoir in January 2017.\n\nThat came over a week after the resignation of Mr McGuinness, leading some to accuse Sinn Fein of flip-flopping on whether RHI should be subject to a full public inquiry or an independent investigation.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Murphy said there are indications the inquiry is likely to hear more explosive evidence over the next few weeks.\n\nWhen asked when Stormont might resume, Mr Murphy said his party intends to have ministers in place by next April 1, the start of the new financial year.\n\n“Our intention is to have ministers in place by April 1, our intention is not to sit back here and allow the timetable of drift to be dictated by the British Government and the DUP in terms of their own Brexit interests,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"11 terrible first dates were guessing didnt lead to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Flight controllers monitored the cabin pressure while working to come up with a better long-term solution.\n\nThe leaking Soyuz — one of two at the station — arrived at the orbiting lab in June with three astronauts. \n\nIt will also take them home in December, and serves as a lifeboat in case of an emergency. \n\nA Nasa spokesman said it was too early to speculate on whether the three might have to return to Earth early if the leak cannot be stopped.\n\nThe hole is located in the upper section of the Soyuz, which does not return to Earth, according to Nasa.\n\nThe 250-mile-high outpost is home to three Americans, two Russians and one German.

If they do pay their money then I will have the conversation with them. \n\n“Usually it’s when results are bad. I feel exactly the same as they do. It does get a bit personal sometimes. We went through a few managers there and I did get a bit of stick about that.”\n\nO’Doherty is crazy busy, admitting himself that he spends 70 per cent of his time travelling across the world to meet customers personally. For him the personal touch is vital when it comes to meeting customers and establishing relationships. \n\nFor that reason he is a hard man to nail down, but he is not afraid to raise his head above the parapet, as he did during the recent controversy over the pricing of Europa League tickets at the Brandywell. \n\nBut with 840 families in Derry, 400 in South Carolina and 320 in Dubai relying on his ability to grow his business, there are more important issues on his mind day to day. \n\n“I would never let Derry City get in the way of that because too many families depend on me here to pay mortgages and car payments and stuff like that,” he continued. \n\n“I’ve always made it clear to the board that I’m not going to available. The big concern I do have is that I am away so much, probably 70 per cent of the time I’m out of Derry – is that reasonable for a chairman? I don’t know, but that’s the way it is at the minute. \n\n“When things are going well it’s an easy job but when things aren’t going well, it’s a difficult job.”\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWith around 1,500 employees to cater to worldwide, there is a huge responsibility on O’Doherty’s shoulders, but it is one he carries well, with E\u0026ampI’s profits and workforce growing year on year. \n\nEven in his home town, so many rely on him. \n\n“I don’t even think about that, there’s no time to worry about that, you just have to get on with it,” he admits. \n\n“If I can keep the customers happy and bring in the sales from those customers, that’s key. It’s very easy to bring in a sale from customers who were happy with their last order. If that’s gone well, it’s easy to get the next ones. \n\n“We have some long-standing relationships with very big companies, some multinationals and the internet sector, we would count as customers and I would look after them personally.\n“I just keep going. I work very heavily in sales so I’m away a lot.\n\n“I suppose at the end of every year you sit down and see what the achievements were for the year and what you’re going to do next year. But I think I’m just too busy to reflect on where we are versus where we started.”\n\n“At the last count, O’Doherty’s personal value was estimated at £163 million, making him one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland. \n\nAt 25 years old, O’Doherty left Du Pont to start a business which focused solely on engineering. \n\nNow, 32 years on, the former St. Columb’s College student retains his hands-on approach. \n\n“I do get involved in things and because I’m an engineer, I’m very interested in research and development. I talk to a lot of customers who say: ‘I wish we could get this or I wish we could do that’, so that turns into a project. \n\n“I’m partly doing technical sales, but I’m partly working in research as well. I am using my engineering skills it’s not just a management job where I’m not actually doing things. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I think getting close to customers is really important, because you have to ask the question – why do people in Silicon Valley place orders with a company in Donegal? They don’t just happen to be driving past and call in and see us, we go out and talk to them and show what we have.\n\n“We have a fabulous work force, which is the big advantage that we have. It’s a mix between Derry and Donegal people who have a great work this, a good education.”\n\n\nDown time\n\n\nThat passion for his work continues to drive him on, be it in his office overlooking the building in Burnfoot, in Anderson, South Carolina or in Dubai. \n\nThere is no down time for O’Doherty it seems. \n\n“To be honest, I’m quite happy with my lifestyle at the minute,” he shrugs. \n\n“I would like a little more free time. I’ve just become a grandfather my grandson is 14 and a half months and I would definitely want to spend more time with him. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, so I would like more family time but at the same time I like what I do. I like engineering.\n\n“Earlier this morning I was looking at some drawings for a large project we’re doing for a client and I really enjoyed going through them. I wouldn’t want to be an accountant. A lot of engineering people tend to make out that they’re management only then all of a sudden all they are doing is looking at financial statements all the time. \n\n“I do do that. I can read a balance sheet, but I wouldn’t want it to be the main focus of my job.”\n\nO’Doherty has created something hugely significant right on his own doorstep. His value to his home town cannot just be measured in jobs alone, but by other contributions, which he does not want acknowledged in print. \n\n“He has helped bail Derry City out twice, once in 1995 and again in 2010. From whatever angle you choose to look. It’s clear that O’Doherty cares, and cares deeply about his home town, and the people in it. \n\n“We have the right people in this area,” he explains. “We probably underestimate how talented our people are. I sometimes think we lack in confidence. I go to other cities in Ireland and the UK and they seem to be very confident whereas as soon as our people get stuck into a project, they are probably more impressive than people from these other locations. I think that’s the work ethic particularly. \n\n“What I notice about people here as well, is that if they encounter a technical problem they are very innovative in coming up with a solution. They tend to try and work solutions out themselves. I think that’s natural. I think this innovation is very, very important.\n\n“It’s not all me. I started it off but I developed a team. My workforce and in particular my two directors Damien and Cathal they have done a lot more than I have in terms of what’s in this building. I may bring the sales in but what you see in the factory is largely down to them.”\n\nAnother key issue for O’Doherty is education in the city, primarily the development of Magee university, which he believes has been held back in recent years. \n\n“We’re still short engineers there’s not enough engineers and there’s the lack of a proper university here,” he insists. \n\n“Magee is definitely making progress with the new vice-chancellor but it should have been making that progress years ago. \n\n\"The reason that I feel so disappointed at the lack of sufficient progress in the university, is that, when I meet other people who own businesses and you get talking to them, one of the questions I get asked is ‘Why have you built your factory in such and such a place?’ There’s two answers I give them one is that I was born here, and two is that \n\n“I went to university here and I met my wife. I think you need a good university to attract good people and I think the university will attract people who will eventually settle here as well.\nThat will create businesses which will help the university and all of a sudden you have a virtuous circle of good stable employment. Without a university, it’s definitely more difficult.”\n\n\nRetirement?\n\n\nSo, does he have an end-game? At 57 years old, is retirement now starting to creep into his thinking?\n\n“I certainly think I have got seven or eight more years until I think about retiring. \n\nI will probably wind it down a bit. \n\nI would like to work less hours and spend more time with my grandson particular, but I still want to do something. I don’t play golf,” he laughed.\nThe last question is a simple one- ‘Do you feel appreciated?’\n\n“I think I am, not by everybody but it really doesn’t matter,” he says. \n\n“I’ve got a very good relationship with my shop floor in particular. I tend to come down here on a Saturday morning if I’m not away and walk around. \n\n\"I just want to know what’s happening, because I don’t have time during the week because of my travels. I just don’t get time. I like to walk around and if there are any new starts I have a worked with them.\n“Am I appreciated? I’m not 100% sure, but hopefully.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"call rural businesses derry strabane area attend workshops funding next week","story":"\nRural businesses in the Derry and Strabane District Council area are being encouraged to avail of LEADER funding that is available under the NI Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.\n\nThe Scheme is now open for its fifth call and is encouraging new and existing rurally based micro/small businesses and social economy enterprises involved in non-agricultural/non agri-food related activities who may be eligible, to apply.\n\nA series of pre-application workshops have been scheduled as part of the funding scheme and anyone interested in applying is advised that they must attend one of the sessions and fill out an expressions of interest form to make an application.\n\nThe mandatory information session will be held on Thursday 06 September at the Belfry Countyr Inn at 7pm Friday, 07 September at the Strabane Enterprise Agency at 10.30am Monday 10 September at the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg at 2.30pm and Tuesday 11 September at St Columb’s Park House, Derry at 7pm.\n\nThe NI Rural Development Programme 2014-20 is part-funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  and the EU.

Building on the success of last year’s event, SuperValu has introduced new categories to help capture the good work done across the whole spectrum of Northern Ireland society.\n\nLast year Derry man, Nathaniel Hunter was named joint second place whilst teenager, Jamie Harkin, took the joint third place, both winning SuperValu shopping vouchers and a framed certificate.\n\nNathaniel was awarded for his quick thinking and reactions when a pleasant stroll along the beach turned into a rescue drama for himself and his wife when they realised three children, aged 10, 11 and 12, had been swept out to sea. The coastguard had already been alerted and were on their way, but Nathaniel knew there was no time to lose, dashed to get a buoyancy aid and raced into the water, swimming out to the terrified kids.\n\nAnother young man followed and brought the closest child to safety whist Nathaniel swam on, getting hold of one youngster and throwing the aid to another. A strong swimmer, he brought them both back to the beach were they were treated in hospital but lived to tell the tale. Nathaniel was praised by the coastguard and of course the families of the young lives he saved that day.\n\nJamie also from Derry, had a story of extreme courage and kindness in the most challenging of circumstances. Poignantly, this exceptional young man was nominated by his mum Trisha, who had recently passed away but the family took the tough decision to proceed with the SuperStars nomination in their mother’s honour. Seven years previously Jamie was diagnosed with blood cancer Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.\n\nHis late mum told of how, before, during and after an unsuccessful organ transplant Jamie never complained. He went on to set up a wonderful support group called Jamie’s Journey in a bid to give hope to other young people touched by cancer. During his exams, the brave young man, whilst taking regular hits of morphine due to the pain, battled on and gained 10As and A*s in his GCSEs. Like many, the inspiring young man is a Star Wars fan, and after winning every fan’s dream prize of a custom light sabre, he selflessly raffled it to raise funds for charity.\n\nDue to popular demand, the deadline for entries has been extended by two weeks to Friday 14th September.\n\nStephen Bogle, SuperValu Brand Manager, said: “With entries flooding in from right across Northern Ireland, we are one step closer to finding this year’s SuperValu SuperStars.

encouraged to help with the post event clean up by squeezing, squashing and binning their used water bottles.\n\nOver 2,000 runners are expected to take part in Sunday’s race and organisers Derry City and Strabane District Council have introduced a number of innovative eco-initiatives to help make the event more environmentally friendly.\n\nWater stations along the route will be using smaller water bottles this year while recycle bins will be located 150-200 metres after each station for runners to discard the bottles which will be reused in art installations during this year’s Halloween celebrations.\n\nWaste Services Manager at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Nicola McCool, said runners’ co-operation in emptying their bottles will significantly help the Cleansing department’s post event operation.\n\n“We have taken a number of steps to ensure the plastic water bottles being used for Sunday’s race are reduced, reused and recycled but we are appealing to runners to make a conscious effort too to empty and squash your bottles before using the bins provided to dispose of them,” she said.\n\n“Cleaning up the empty bottles from the race route and emptying any unused water is a time consuming process for our cleansing and recycling teams so we would appreciate everyone’s co-operation.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize

installation at this year’s Halloween celebrations.” \n\nOther eco-initiatives in Sunday’s race include paperless registrations and instructions, recyclable race pack bags and a Recycled Arts and Crafts workshop for kids.\n\nEvent organisers will also position Recycling Advert walkers around the course who will engage with members of the public on how they can apply the principles of recycling in their everyday lives.\nThe project is part of Council’s wider Zero Waste Strategy which has the ultimate aim of making the City and District a sustainable region.\n\nThe Waterside Half Marathon is one of the longest running athletics events in Ireland with a scenic route that takes in both sides of the River Foyle, passing many of the city’s historic landmarks including its famous walls and the Guildhall.\n\nThe 13.1 mile course has runner, wheelchair and three person relay categories and is open to athletes of all levels and abilities and full event details are available at

The words “I want to be an organ donor” are simple, but what an inspirational difference they could make. \n\nThis Organ Donation Week  the Western Health and Social Care Trust  is centred on encouraging people to talk to those closest to them about organ donation. Many people don’t realise that their family’s support is needed for organ donation to go ahead.\n\nApproximately 140 people in Northern Ireland are waiting on life-saving transplants and approximately 6,000 people in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately every year around 14 people in Northern Ireland die waiting for an organ transplant, highlighting the real shortage of organ donations.\n\nDr Declan Grace, Lead Clinician for Organ Donation at the Western Trust said: “Organ donation transforms and saves lives and the Western Trust is encouraging everyone to join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones that they wish to be a donor, so that they are aware of their wishes.\n\n“Deciding to become an organ donor is entirely your decision but it does affect your family. After your death, your next of kin will be consulted on whether your organs can be donated, even if you carry a donor card, and any decision they make will be respected. When families or friends know the wishes of their loved ones it makes the situation less stressful and can give them the confidence to fulfil your wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“No one wants to think or talk about dying but set in the context of helping one or more than one person after death, the conversation becomes easier. The more people pledge to donate their organs and tissues after their death, the more people stand to benefit. Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 there were seven organ donors in the Western Trust area, resulting in 20 patients receiving a transplant.”\n\nDr Grace continued: “There is a constant drive towards promoting organ donation in the Western Trust and it has been successful. This is shown in the number of people registered as potential donors which has increased from about 25% to 43% in Northern Ireland over the past five years. While this is very encouraging, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure as many people as possible join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones about their wishes.”\n\nThere are many ways to register as a potential donor:\n\nRegister online at \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n or \nwww.organdonationni.info\n\nRegister when applying for or renewing a driving licence.\nRegister when registering with a G.P Practice.\nTelephone the N.H.S. Donor Line 0300 123 23 23. Telephone lines are open 24 hours a day all year round.\nDownload a form from \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n, print it and return it by Freepost\nRegister when applying for a Boot’s Advantage Card.\n\n\nPictured above: Highlighting the need for more people to sign up to the organ donor register and telling your family your wishes is: Maria Coyle Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation and Dr Declan Grace Lead Clinician for Organ Donation in the Western Trust.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth festival reaches its finale","story":"\nElin Manahan Thomas will be performing at the Machynlleth Festival.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8106823/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nCelebration of Welsh composer at Machynlleth\n\nAnn Murray will be leading a workshop at the Machynlleth Festival.

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there.
