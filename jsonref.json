Andrew Sparrow has the latest on our UK live blog… Yohannes Lowe will be with you shortly to take you through the rest of the day.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing that President Joe Biden’s order showed the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Biden told US intelligence officials to redouble their efforts to investigate the origins of the pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory. After months of minimizing that possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure on China to be more open about the outbreak, in part aiming to head off domestic US complaints from Republican that the president has not been tough enough to press China on alleged obstruction. Regular watcher of US-China relations will know that in the daily press briefings Zhao usually has something to say about the US, and today has said the country must open itself up to investigations into its biological laboratories, including at the military’s Fort Detrick base. “The US side claims that it wants China to participate in a comprehensive, transparent, evidence-based international investigation,” Zhao said. “We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organization on origin tracing research in a scientific manner.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Growing awareness of climate change among consumers drives corporate movesYou could set your watch by many biological events, but not anymoreState is offering \u0026euro2bn in support to electricity generators over the next decade through the Renewable Energy Support Scheme"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Return would be a great success for Bord na M\u0026oacutena\u0026rsquos peatland bioersity measures"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus immunity may last for years finds study","story":"Vaccinated people who were never infected most likely will need the shots, however, as will a minority who were infected but did not produce a robust immune response. Photograph: Dimas ArdianBloombergImmunity to the coronavirus lasts at least a year, probably much longer, and improves over time especially after vaccination, according to two new studies. The findings may help put to rest lingering fears that protection against the virus will be short-lived.Together, the studies suggest that most people who have recovered from Covid-19 and who were later immunised will not need boosters. Vaccinated people who were never infected most likely will need the shots, however, as will a minority who were infected but did not produce a robust immune response.Both reports looked at people who had been exposed to the coronavirus about a year earlier. Cells that retain a memory of the virus persist in the bone marrow and may churn out antibodies whenever needed, according to one of the studies, published Monday in the journal Nature.The other study, which is also under review for publication in Nature, found that these so-called memory B cells continue to mature and strengthen for at least 12 months after the initial infection.“The papers are consistent with the growing body of literature that suggests that immunity elicited by infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 appears to be long-lived,” said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research.The studies may soothe fears that immunity to the virus is transient, as is the case with coronaviruses that cause common colds. But those viruses change significantly every few years, Hensley said.“The reason we get infected with common coronaviruses repetitively throughout life might have much more to do with variation of these viruses rather than immunity,” he said.‘Terrific response’In fact, memory B cells produced in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced with vaccination are so potent that they thwart even variants of the virus, negating the need for boosters, according to Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York who led the study on memory maturation.“People who were infected and get vaccinated really have a terrific response, a terrific set of antibodies, because they continue to evolve their antibodies,” Mr Nussenzweig said. “I expect that they will last for a long time.” The result may not apply to protection derived from vaccines alone, because immune memory is likely to be organised differently after immunisation, compared with that following natural infection. That means people who have not had Covid-19 and have been immunised may eventually need a booster shot, Nussenzweig said. “That’s the kind of thing that we will know very, very soon,” he said. Upon first encountering a virus, B cells rapidly proliferate and produce antibodies in large amounts. Once the acute infection is resolved, a small number of the cells take up residence in the bone marrow, steadily pumping out modest levels of antibodies.To look at memory B cells specific to the new coronavirus, researchers led by Ali Ellebedy of Washington University in St. Louis analysed blood from 77 people at three-month intervals, starting about a month after their infection with the coronavirus. Only six of the 77 had been hospitalised for Covid-19 the rest had mild symptoms.Antibody levels in these iniduals dropped rapidly four months after infection and continued to decline slowly for months afterward – results that are in line with those from other studies. Some scientists have interpreted this decrease as a sign of waning immunity, but it is exactly what is expected, other experts said. If blood contained high quantities of antibodies to every pathogen the body had ever encountered, it would quickly transform into a thick sludge.Acute infectionInstead, blood levels of antibodies fall sharply following acute infection, while memory B cells remain quiescent in the bone marrow, ready to take action when needed. Ellebedy’s team obtained bone marrow samples from 19 people roughly seven months after they had been infected. Fifteen had detectable memory B cells, but four did not, suggesting that some people might carry very few of the cells or none at all.“It tells me that even if you got infected, it doesn’t mean that you have a super immune response,” Ellebedy said. The findings reinforce the idea that people who have recovered from Covid-19 should be vaccinated, he said. Nussenzweig’s team looked at how memory B cells mature over time. The researchers analysed blood from 63 people who had recovered from Covid-19 about a year earlier. The vast majority of the participants had mild symptoms, and 26 had also received at least one dose of either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.So-called neutralising antibodies, needed to prevent reinfection with the virus, remained unchanged between six and 12 months, while related but less important antibodies slowly disappeared, the team found. As memory B cells continued to evolve, the antibodies they produced developed the ability to neutralize an even broader group of variants. This ongoing maturation may result from a small piece of the virus that is sequestered by the immune system ? for target practice, so to speak.The results of Nussenzweig’s study suggest that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and who have later been vaccinated will continue to have extremely high levels of protection against emerging variants, even without receiving a vaccine booster down the line.“It kind of looks exactly like what we would hope a good memory B cell response would look like,” said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in the new research. – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe .Dr Eddie O’Connor has resigned as chairman of Mainstream Renewable Power a week after controversial remarks regarding investment in Africa that were dubbed “climate colonialism”.The well known businessman was at last week’s Dublin Climate Dialogues series where he spoke briefly about dealing with leaders of “tribal societies”, referring to a lack of a tradition of democracy in Africa.Describing his remarks as “entirely inappropriate and insensitive,” he said: “I made inaccurate and harmful generalisations about the continent of Africa that do not reflect reality, and instead serve only to perpetuate stereotypes. I take personal responsibility for my comments and recognise the hurt I have caused in making them.”During an onstage panel discussion on investment, Dr O’Connor had said: “The great problem that we found trying to electrify Africa with renewable energy has been the lack of capability.“When you go and talk to the ministers and the prime ministers and the ministers for finance, they do not have that tradition of democracy.“They are largely tribal societies they don’t have the educated cadres who are going to be able to do this. I see if we get our policies right in the west we certainly could do it but we have the big problem and that problem is the lack of profitability.”Dr O’Connor set up Mainstream Renewable Power in 2008 after the sale of his first green energy business, Airtricity.On Thursday morning, Mainstream Renewable Power issued a statement saying Dr O’Connor had resigned as chairman of the board with immediate effect.“Dr O’Connor, who turns 74 in June, founded the company in 2008 and was chief executive officer until 2017, at which point he was appointed executive chairman of the board of directors,” it said, also noting that he was leaving the board.“Aker Horizons, the Norwegian company dedicated to investing in renewable energy and green technologies, recently completed its acquisition of 75 per cent of the company.”“On behalf of the Board, I wish to thank Eddie for his unwavering commitment and dedication to fulfilling his vision of a world electrified by renewable energy,” Mr Røkke said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"new 86m garda hq is too small spending watchdog finds","story":"Designs for new Garda national support headquarters on Military Road near Heuston Station. Photograph: OPWThe Dáil’s spending watchdog has found that a new €86.6 million headquarters for An Garda is no longer fit for purpose as it won’t be big enough to fit all personnel from the Garda units that were due to move there. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has today published a report on a number of issues it identified with projects undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and it accused the agency of “poor management” of the Garda development.The committee examined the construction of a Garda complex at Military Road, Dublin 8 which is due to be completed in the third quarter of 2022. The report says that the estimated cost is €86.6 million, a €6.6 million increase on the original estimate. It is due to replace the current Garda accommodation at Harcourt Square which is being leased from a commercial landlord. During its investigation into the project the PAC requested information from the OPW on the selection process for the Military Road site and whether potential future increases in Garda personnel informed the decision. The PAC notes that a Policing Authority report published in 2019 shows the Garda Commissioner stated that the development at Military Road will not be sufficient to accommodate all units currently based in Harcourt Square. The OPW told the PAC that in 2016 there were 850 to 890 members of Garda personnel based in Harcourt Square and that the Military Road complex will be sufficient to accommodate the same number of staff upon completion. However, the PAC report says that the OPW also explained that recent increases in Garda personnel, combined with changes to Garda operations, has resulted in other locations being required to house some of the units currently based in Harcourt Square. However, they also explained that contingency plans using State owned and leased premises are in development to accommodate anticipated further increases in Garda personnel and operationsThe PAC report says that developing a premises based on 2016 staff numbers and operational needs “does not represent best practice”. It added that this “is compounded by the fact that as early as 2018 the OPW and An Garda Síochána were aware that An Garda Síochána’s staff numbers had increased and that the organisation had undergone organisational change.”The PAC report says: “the failure to review the Military Road development in 2018 based on these factors represents poor management and has resulted in a major capital project no longer being fit for purpose.”Covid-19 delaysThere have been delays in construction due to Covid-19 and the PAC previously quizzed the OPW on whether it will be completed on time, and if a contingency plan exists to manage such delays.The OPW told the committee it expects the site to be completed on time but said there is a contingency plan to use a number of existing Garda buildings to accommodate staff if the development is delayed. The PAC report says that “due to the on-going pandemic the Committee is of the opinion that further delays are highly likely.”The PAC recommends that the OPW develops a detailed contingency plan to accommodate the staff in Harcourt Square if the Military Road development is not completed on time. It also says the OPW should “keep all of its projects in the planning stages under review to ensure that any changes, such as staff increases or operational change, are incorporated into the plans and that construction does not commence until all parties are satisfied that the project will meet the needs of the client Department, both at the time and into the future.”The PAC says that “this will help ensure that public funds expended on capital projects provide long-term value-for-money for the State and the taxpayer. “Failure to proactively manage capital projects in this way can result in additional expenditure,” it warns.Vacant propertiesThe report also looks at vacant Garda property after the closure of 139 stations between 2012 and 2013. Thirty-six of the stations were disposed of between 2014 and 2016 but this process was halted for two years due to two Garda reviews related to the vacant properties. Plans to sell stations resumed in 2019 and the OPW said last month that there were 49 vacant Garda properties that were either being prepared for disposal or under consideration for community or County Council use. The PAC report says nine of the properties identified were vacant prior to 2012 and says that given that these have been vacant for up to a decade “the OPW has not been pro-active enough in maximising the potential of the State’s assets.”The PAC report says there are “on-going issues” with the lease of Miesian Plaza, the headquarters of the Department of Health and also accommodates other State agenciesThe OPW’s mis-measurement of the floor space for the building is expected to result in an over-payment of €10 million during the lifetime of the lease. In October 2018 the OPW stated that it was negotiating with the owner of the premises in an attempt to have the floor space measurements upon which the lease is based recalibrated and last November it confirmed the negotiations were still ongoing. The PAC report says the committee “remains concerned that the OPW will not succeed in preventing taxpayers being exposed for an additional €10 million that is a direct result of a fundamental error by OPW. “The Committee is also unsatisfied that after two years of negotiations with the landlord that no substantial developments have taken place.”The PAC recommends that the OPW “takes all necessary steps to prevent the forecasted loss of approximately €10 million and that the OPW ensures it has appropriately qualified staff to manage its property transactions on behalf of the State.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland becomes first eu country to declare israel is involved in de facto annexation","story":"Palestinians sit around a fire between their families’ destroyed houses in Beit Hanoun town, northern Gaza Strip, on Wednesday. Photograph: Mohammed SaberEPAIreland has become the first EU member state to declare the building of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories as de facto annexation, after the Dáil on Wednesday night passed a motion tabled by Sinn Fein. The Dáil rejected, however, a proposal to expel the Israeli ambassador to the Republic and impose comprehensive sanctions against Israel by 87 votes to 46, with no abstentions.A spokesman for Israel’s foreign ministry said it “outright rejects” the motion.Lior Haiat said on Twitter that Ireland’s “outrageous and baseless” position regarding some Israeli settlements reflects a “blatantly one-sided and simplistic policy” and constitutes a “victory for extremist Palestinian factions”. “The motion distances Ireland from its ambition to contribute and play a constructive role in the Israeli-Palestinian context,” he wrote.Mr Haiat said the vote followed “unacceptable anti-Israel statements that were heard in Ireland at a time when the citizens of Israel were being subject to terror attacks by the more than 4,000 rockets that were launched from the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terrorist organization.”The Government had in a debate on Tuesday night supported the Sinn Féin proposal and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said during debate on the issue that “we need to be honest with what is happening on the ground and call it out” as “de facto annexation”.He added that the Republic is the first EU country to state this and it could be a message to the global community.Mr Coveney echoed the comments of Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman John Brady, who said that “we are baldly stating that Israel is acting illegally under international law”.Sinn Féin had accepted for their motion a Government amendment condemning the actions of militant Palestinian group Hamas.Cabinet meetingA Cabinet meeting was held on Tuesday and agreed to back the Sinn Féin proposal if the party included reference to violence “on all sides in the conflict”, following intense violence in the Gaza region over the past two weeks before a ceasefire was called.More than 240 Palestinians have been killed in the outbreak of violence, including 66 children, with 10 Israeli deaths, including two children.Mr Coveney had said he found it “deeply troubling” that Sinn Féin could not bring itself to also condemn the actions of Hamas for also killing children and innocent civilians.However, when the Minister insisted in Tuesday’s debate on the condemnation of “the killing of civilians by both sides in this conflict”, Sinn Féin accepted this amendment without a vote.People Before Profit had introduced the amendment calling for the ambassador’s expulsion to the Sinn Féin motion. The Dáil passed the Sinn Féin motion itself on Wednesday night.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, speaking before the vote on his party’s amendment, described it as “historic” and said that it was the first time the Irish parliament would vote on the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.“Most likely it is the first time any parliament in the EU has held such a vote,” he said.Amendment wordingThe rejected amendment stated that “the Israeli apartheid system through its ongoing ethnic cleansing, brutal state repression and murderous military violence, including four savage military assaults on Gaza in recent years, has no place among the international community of nations”.It called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and “all Israeli diplomatic staff”, as well as for the application of “a comprehensive package of economic, political and cultural sanctions against the state of Israel, similar to that applied to apartheid South Africa”.The amendment also called for the maintenance of such sanctions and their promotion within the EU and internationally “until the entire Israeli apartheid system is dismantled and all the Palestinian people enjoy national self-determination and full and equal rights”.

Meanwhile several countries with large Syrian refugee populations, including Turkey and Germany, have blocked voting.The vote is taking place in defiance of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a new constitution ahead of elections but a collapsing regional commitment to the resolution has seen increasing numbers of Arab states accept the sham elections as evidence of a genuine political transition.Last month Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry claimed that the vote would allow the Syrian people to “choose their future and form a government that represents them.”States like Egypt may cite the election as reason to readmit Syria to the Arab League, from which it was suspended in November 2011. While sclerotic and functionally irrelevant, Syria’s readmission to the body would symbolise the completion of Assad’s regional rehabilitation, a process that has progressed significantly in the past few years.The United Arab Emirates, which once supported Syrian rebels, reopened its embassy in Damascus in December 2018, followed shortly afterwards by Bahrain. The move reflected growing Arab concern over their diminished role in Syria amid the growing influence of Turkey and Iran.Even Saudi Arabia is making overtures towards Damascus, earlier this month dispatching intelligence chief Gen Khalid Humeidan for the first known meeting with his Syrian counterpart since the start of the war. The regional impact of Syria’s collapsing economy may be driving re-engagement. More than 80 per cent of Syria’s population now live in poverty amid runaway inflation. A recent survey carried out in the capital showed that nearly two in three Damascenes want to emigrate, with the majority citing declining living standards as the biggest factor.Suffering under sanctions and saddled with debt, the government has turned on former regime insiders for shakedowns. Among those targeted is Assad’s cousin Rami Makhlouf, once known as Mr Five Per Cent for the cut he was reputed to take from any new business venture.A new class of warlords, smugglers and racketeers has taken the place of the former business elite. The country now produces so much of the methamphetamine captagon that experts describe Syria as a narco-state.In April, Saudi customs intercepted millions of dollars of captagon hidden in pomegranates arriving from Lebanon, which is a conduit for Syrian drug exports. The find alarmed Saudi officials enough that they banned imports of produce from Lebanon, which is suffering its own economic collapse.While the West continues to oppose the vote, their words will be powerless to halt the process. “A legitimate election can only follow an inclusive and transparent process” – as laid out by the UN Security Council in resolution 2254 – “where all eligible voters can take part, free from intimidation,” said Jonathan Hargreaves, UK Special Representative for Syria.Assad responded to those views on Wednesday by saying that Syria would disregard them. The “value of those opinions is zero,” he said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"batley grammar teacher allowed back school prophet mohammed","story":"The Batley Grammar teacher who showed a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in class will be allowed to return to the classroom but the picture should not be used again in any lesson, the Trust has said.The Religious Studies (RS) teacher, who was forced into hiding after receiving death threats, had not intended to cause offence, an investigation into the incident found.The investigation, commissioned by the Batley Multi Academy Trust, found that the teacher “genuinely believed” that the image had “an educational purpose and benefit”.The Trust said it was not necessary to use pictures of the Prophet Muhammed in RS lessons or any other lessons out of “respect” for the views of the school community.It added that it will not avoid addressing challenging subject matter but at the same time is committed to ensuring that offence is not caused. Critics have warned that teachers should not face a religious veto on what material they can use in the classroom, adding that the Trust\u0027s stance is a route to censorship. Batley Grammar School  sent pupils home early for the Easter holidays and issued an apology after a group of Muslims gathered at the gates to protest.The headmaster announced that  the Religious Studies teacher had been suspended while the school looked into what happened.The teacher - who was branded a “terrorist” by one Muslim community leader - reportedly said he feared he and his family would be murdered and that he would never be able to return to his job or home.The academy trust that runs Batley Grammar School then announced that it would carry out an independent investigation into the context in which the cartoon was shown.Stephen Evans, chief executive of the National Secular Society,  said he welcomes the decision to lift the teachers\u0027 suspensions. “But the trust’s stated commitment to ensuring offence is not caused is a route to censorship, and sets a very poor precedent, he said.  “The outcome of this local investigation will affect teachers’ ability to do their jobs across the country. So the government should face questions over its failure to show leadership when fundamental principles were at stake. “Teachers must be able to explore challenging issues in the classroom and shouldn\u0027t face a religious veto on which resources they can use.”The Trust\u0027s full report was not published but the executive summary cited guidelines from the Department for Education which state that schools are allowed to include a range of ideas and materials in lessons, including where they are “challenging or controversial”.The report said that schools must balance this with the need to promote respect and tolerance between people of different faiths and beliefs, including in deciding which materials to use in the classroom. The investigators said that “great care must be taken” that lessons featuring controversial topics are taught in a way that “promotes respect and tolerance between people of different faiths, beliefs and values”.The report went on to say: “In the light of the above, and in respect of the views of our school community the Trust is clear that it is not necessary for staff to use the material in question to deliver the learning outcomes on the subject of blasphemy or any such images of the type used on 22 March for use in any Trust RS lessons, or any other lessons”.Batley Multi Academy Trust said it accepts all the report’s recommendations, adding: “The findings are clear, that the teaching staff involved did not use the resource with the intention of causing offence, and that the topics covered by the lesson could have been effectively addressed in other ways.“In the light of those conclusions, the suspensions put in place while the investigation was underway will now be lifted.” It is not known whether the teachers will return to the classroom. A spokesman for the Trust added: The Trust deeply regrets the distress caused by the use of this resource, and we would like to thank all of the Trust’s stakeholders for their contributions and support during what has been a difficult period.  All those in our Trust’s family – whether parents, staff or members of our wider school community – want us to continue to provide a high-quality education so that our students aspire to excellence and achieve their full potential, both in their academic studies and personal development.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"did national trust end sorry state","story":"In the heritage world, David has just beaten Goliath. This week, Tim Parker, chairman of the National Trust, resigned after seven years in the role – and just 24 hours after a rebel group of members launched a bid to depose him at the annual general meeting.Restore Trust – of which I am a member – was only founded last month. It already has 10,000 supporters and a fighting fund of £50,000. It was founded to restore the trust to its original aims – to concentrate on conservation, an aesthetic experience, a sense of place, a feeling of welcome and an apolitical ethos. It has claimed a major scalp in the shape of Tim Parker.“This is the first step in a very important process,” a Restore Trust spokesman told me, “returning the trust to its true purpose, to care for the nation’s heritage – you can’t do that if you’re denouncing it. It’s vital it now has a chairman who cares about Britain’s heritage and can rebuild trust in the organisation.”It’s also a victory for grassroots members and volunteers over the National Trust management. During the past four years, the trust has become disastrously politicised. That – and the trust’s catastrophic dumbing-down – has been snowballing for 20 years.This decline has been at the hands of the trust’s management. The members and volunteers have only ever wanted what the trust was founded to do: preserve buildings of national interest, along with their furniture and pictures, and preserve beautiful landscapes. It’s the management that’s turned political.Last September, the trust published a report into the links between its properties – including Chartwell, the home of Winston Churchill – and Britain’s past colonial and slavery connections. The report was sloppy and littered with errors, like so much of the trust’s literature in recent years.Parker’s tenure as chairman since 2014 has only intensified the politicisation. At last year’s annual meeting, he said the trust had “not become a political organisation that has been taken over by a bunch of woke folk”. Yet in recent years, the trust has become increasingly political in its focus.There’s nothing wrong in the trust researching historical slavery links with its houses. But, as well as publishing its self-lacerating 2020 study, snappily entitled ‘Interim Report on the Connections between Colonialism and Properties now in the Care of the National Trust, Including Links with Historic Slavery’, in recent years it has launched a series of political initiatives slanted at attacking historical attitudes – and the owners of its houses – for not following modern progressive opinions.Any idea of praising the trust’s extraordinary contribution to British architectural, artistic and intellectual history has been eclipsed by this obsession with attacking “old-fashioned” attitudes.In 2018, the trust explored women’s history and suffrage via the anniversary of women gaining the vote in 1918. Of course, women getting the vote was a marvellous thing, but it is the trust’s job to look after houses and landscapes – not to celebrate political anniversaries.In 2017, as part of the trust’s ‘Prejudice and Pride’ season, it outed as gay Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer (1906-69), the kind man who’d given Felbrigg Hall to the trust. It also tried and failed to stop volunteers who refused to wear rainbow-coloured lanyards from working with the public.That year, in 2017, I went to the National Trust’s AGM in Swindon. Many of the members were up in arms. They had trekked hundreds of miles to the meeting on a cold, windy day – and their complaints were comprehensively ignored.One member, Stephen Green from Carmarthen, was outraged about what happened at Felbrigg. He asked the chairman if he would stop the trust being a political campaigning organisation that represented the “few who live and breathe political correctness”.Parker was the master of the non-apology apology: half-saying sorry, and then quickly snatching it away. He admitted that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Felbrigg incident had been a “small misjudgement”. But then he went on to say he was surprised and bemused by the hoohah.At the AGM, Patrick Streeter, a National Trust member from Essex, asked for an apology over the Felbrigg saga. Parker apologised “for any offence caused” – another classic non-apology apology.The trust also denies the catastrophic dumbing-down of its properties. Parker said: “We are not engaged in some social engineering experiment to thin out the intellectual content of our house presentation.”But the thinning-out of intellectual content at trust properties is undeniable. Last year, the trust set out its proposals for ‘Curation and Experience’, as part of its ‘Reset’ programme. It planned to get rid of all the lead curators in the regions and many junior curators. That meant losing talented scholars in architecture, archaeology, historic gardens, paintings and artefacts.Also last year, in a report called ‘Towards a 10-year vision for places and experiences, version 2.1’, Tony Berry, the trust’s Director of Visitor Experience, said he wanted to “dial down” the trust’s role as a big cultural institution and move away from looking after English country houses. The trust planned to put its collections in storage and hold fewer exhibitions at its properties to prioritise its role as the “gateway to the outdoors”. The 10-year strategy also attacked the “outdated mansion experience”.In 2017, I gave the Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Lecture, which I entitled “Betrayal of Trust: How the National Trust is losing its way”. I spent months touring trust houses and was staggered by the intellectual collapse of an organisation I’d revered since childhood.The trust’s house guides were littered with spelling mistakes. At Hughenden Manor, the Buckinghamshire house of Victorian prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, the trust’s official literature described his climb into “high soceity”. Isaac D’Israeli, Disraeli’s father, was called “Isaace” closely was spelt “closey”.It’s not just the lack of attention to detail baby language was everywhere at trust properties. At Osterley Park, the elegant Adam house on the fringes of west London, the servants’ quarters were decorated with a sign saying: “It was the scullery maid’s job to empty and clean the chamber pots every morning. A very smelly job.” A tree stump at Hughenden had a sign next to it, reading: “Please do not climb on me.”The trust has been dumbing down for 20 years, ever since Dame Fiona Reynolds, a senior civil servant, became its director general.Dame Helen Ghosh, Reynolds’s successor as director general, accelerated the dumbing-down. She even removed furniture from the fine Regency library at Ickworth House, Suffolk, temporarily replacing it with beanbags. There was “so much stuff” in trust houses, she said, that it put people off. Exhibits needed to be “simplified”.The trust is an astonishingly successful organisation, with just under six million members. And yet its management is tortured by paroxysms of self-hating agony because those six million people are largely white, middle-class and middle-aged.“Accessibility” is the trust’s great false god. Of course, anyone can go to any trust property they want. And yet the trust is deeply depressed when the visitor profile is dominated by the pale and stale. And so they’ve become obsessed with changing that profile.A former chairman, Sir Simon Jenkins, was once told by a trust employee that it “feared” many of its new members were “over 50”. As Jenkins said: “In 15 years, half the population would be over 50 and a third over 60. It was good news.”Most charities, anywhere in the world, would be delighted with six million members, of any age or skin colour. Only the National Trust is mad – and rude – enough to take against the background of its members: the people who pay for the trust, volunteer for it and love it.And, as a now-dead former senior employee of the trust once told me: “What you must understand is that a lot of senior people at the trust actually don’t like old buildings.”This whole process – the politicisation and the sad dumbing-down – need never have taken place. English Heritage has maintained its properties with no dumbing down and none of its members has complained.Here’s hoping the new National Trust chairman will end the politics and the hatred of the past and concentrate on the job – looking after its artistic, architectural and landscape treasures.Harry Mount is author of How England Made the English. To order your copy for £8.99, call 0844 851 1514 or visit the  BookshopMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"extinct giant tortoise found galapagos","story":"A giant tortoise found on the Galapagos Islands is from a species last seen more than a century ago, scientists have confirmed.An elderly female tortoise discovered during a 2019 expedition has been identified as a chelonoidis phantasticus, also known as fernandina giant tortoise.Until now the only inidual was collected in 1906 by researchers from the California Academy of Sciences, which was carrying out a survey of the island\u0027s flora and fauna.They brought a sample back to the university, allowing Yale University scientists to make a comparison with the female 113 years later.The female is currently at a breeding centre in Santa Cruz Island, California, but scientists have found prints and droppings on Fernandina Island and think there are more living in the wild, though there have been no other confirmed sightings.Fernandina Island, the third-largest in the Galapagos archipelago, is the site of an active volcano that erupts frequently, leading to fears for the tortoise\u0027s survival.Ecuador\u0027s environment minister celebrated the discovery, writing in a tweet: It was believed extinct more than 100 years ago! Hope is alive.Danny Rueda, director of the Galapagos National Park, said that a future expedition would look for more iniduals. This discovery undoubtedly renews our hope for the recovery of this species, he said.The Galapagos Islands, which are about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, have a high number of species not found anywhere else in the world.Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution after visiting the archipelago on board HMS Beagle in 1835.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust could become woke following chairmans resignation","story":"The National Trust could become more woke following the resignation of its chairman, insiders have claimed, amid demands for his successor to be elected by its 5.6 million members.Tim Parker\u0027s decision to quit was announced just 24 hours after a rebel group of members had laid out plans to force him out at this year\u0027s annual general meeting. There have been concerns that the National Trust has been pushing a so-called woke agenda that includes publishing a report last year into the links between its properties and Britain\u0027s colonial history and slavery.However, sources insist Mr Parker acted as a bulwark against a progressive wing of the charity.The insider said: Parker was always very sceptical around the National Trust attempting to become too progressive. He was always very firm that it should remain non-political, and keen for it to become as businesslike as possible.The Trust said Mr Parker had already served two three-year terms and agreed to a third exceptional term to oversee the charity through the Covid crisis.It began attracting criticism during the regime of its previous director-general, Dame Helen Ghosh, who ran it from 2012 until 2018.Her successor, Hilary McGrady, courted controversy when overseeing the publication of a 115-page report which blacklisted 93 of its estates over their links to slavery, including Sir Winston Churchill\u0027s home at Chartwell in Kent.Critics allege that influential senior managers and advisers have pushed a more politicised agenda and want a new chairman to try to curb any future projects that might be seen to be straying outside the National Trust\u0027s traditional remit to preserve historic properties and countryside and keep them open to the public.It is understood that the controversial report into colonial connections at Trust properties was commissioned by the charity\u0027s influential Curation and Experience Department under the management of John Orna-Ornstein, a museum specialist who was appointed in 2017.The original project was launched in 2018 and the final report published last year, sparking an outcry.In August 2020, Mr Orna-Ornstein said the Black Lives Matter movement had made the Trust realise that we need to go much faster in addressing colonialism and slavery. Sources suggested Mr Parker had little direct involvement and remained remote from this area of work. Conservative MPs have called for the next chairman to be elected by the Trust\u0027s members and said the successful candidate needed to keep its management under a stricter watch.Sir John Hayes, the chairman of the Common Sense Group of around 60 Tory MPs, said the next chairman should overhaul the board to remove any metropolitan glitterati.The next chairman has got to recognise that the Trust has lost its way and needs to return to the principles upon which it was founded, he added. The maintenance and promotion of our heritage isn\u0027t about the faddish preoccupation with all kinds of trendy, right-on causes and campaigns.Andrew Murrison MP, a former minister, said he was worried the new appointment would be stitched up by the other board members.Mr Murrison said the successful candidate had to be put forward to an approval vote at the AGM on Oct 30 in the same way that Parliament is allowed a confirmation hearing for senior public appointments, adding: Most people would be surprised that some input from the membership was not in place already in choosing the chairman.We need a high-profile chairman who can hold his or her own, who has a proven track record, will listen to the members and also be sympathetic to the extremely dedicated workforce.”Restore Trust, a group of disaffected members who were planning to table a motion calling on Mr Parker to resign, said it wanted the recruitment process to be as open as possible. A source said: “We want an open process so we can see the shortlist.”A National Trust spokesman said the appointment would be made by the National Trust Council, which is made up of 36 members who have a range of expertise in everything from education and agriculture to nature and the built environment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trusted instagram forex trader watched life savings disappear","story":"So where does the blame lie?

The fact that the defendant failed to take down the offending tweet was the subject of mainstream media coverage.This outrageously bad libel cut her (Mrs Foster) to the core, causing her considerable upset, distress, humiliation, embarrassment and hurt.Bearing in mind the time of year and the work-related pressures the plaintiff was under at that time, I fully accept this libel took a heavy emotional toll despite her experience of dealing with the heat of robust political debate.Her marriage, her family life and her faith are the most important things in her life. These things provide important pillars of support and it was these things that were publicly trashed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"duke duchess cambridges royal tour scotland pictures","story":"Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s week-long visit to Scotland.Comment: Three cheers for the select committeePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson rejects Dominic Cummings\u0026#39s claims he is \u0026#39unfit for the job\u0026#39 Coronavirus latest news: Hancock says it’s too early to confirm June 21 reopening amid claims Indian variant is now dominantSix times as many Hong Kongers apply to live in UK as EU citizens, Home Office figures revealComment: Vaccine passports backfire - the case of Israel shows thatCovid lockdown roadmap: what are the latest rules as restrictions continue to easeDominic Cummings: His most stunning in-the-room revelations about a Government in chaosComment: \u0026#39You can take off the mask now...\u0026#39 - Confusion reigns for vaccinated Americans   Full moon dates for 2021, including when June\u0026#39s Strawberry Moon will be visibleArlene Foster wins £125,000 payout for defamatory tweet by TV\u0026#39s Dr Christian JessenEmmanuel Macron: France bears \u0026#39overwhelming responsibility\u0026#39 for Rwanda genocide Comment: Starmer may get a poll boost from the Cummings fiasco - but he shouldn\u0026#39t trust it No human remains found at cafe in search for Fred West victim \u0026#39Hamas bomb threat\u0026#39 email arrived half an hour after Ryanair plane was forced to land in BelarusGerman scientists identify possible cause of vaccine blood clots Mapped: The hotspots for the Indian variant of Covid-19 in the UKComment: Universities will be crucial to the nation’s economic and social recoveryWuhan lab leak: Facebook ends ban on posts claiming Covid is man madeCambridges drive Prince Philip\u0026#39s beloved Land Rover to cinema dateHong Kong threatens to jail HSBC bankers handling Jimmy Lai\u0026#39s accountsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron france bears overwhelming responsibility rwanda","story":"French president Emmanuel Macron on Thursday acknowledged France\u0027s overwhelming responsibility in failing to stop the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, saying it had ignored warnings of impending carnage to back a murderous regime.While stopping short of issuing a formal apology, the 43-year old French leader said only Rwandans could forgive his country for its role in the massacre of 800,000 people, most of whom were from the ethnic Tutsi group.Standing here today, with humility and respect, by your side, I have come to recognise our responsibilities, said Mr Macron in a speech at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where more than 250,000 Tutsi people are buried.France, he insisted, had a duty to admit the suffering it inflicted on the Rwandan people by too long valuing silence over the examination of the truth.Mr Macron is the first Gallic leader since 2010 to visit the East African nation, which has long accused France of complicity in the killing of some 800,000 mostly Tutsi Rwandans.Mr Macron said France was not complicit in the genocide.The killers who stalked the swamps, the hills, the churches, did not have the face of France. France was not an accomplice, he said.One Rwanda genocide survivors\u0027 group told AFP it regretted the lack of a clear apology from the French president.But his comments went further than his predecessors when he said that only those who had survived the horrors can maybe forgive, grant us the gift of forgiveness.“I think that speech was a very strong speech because he asked for forgiveness in a subtle manner but in a strong manner. It was subtle but substantively strong,” Jean Paul Kimonyo, a former aide to Rwandan President Paul Kagame, told Reuters.Mr Kagame, who has previously said France participated in the genocide, said last week that the report meant a lot to Rwandans.Rwandans could maybe not forget, but forgive, France for its role, he added.On Thursday, Mr Macron said: France didn\u0027t understand that by seeking to prevent a regional conflict or civil war, it stood de facto by a genocidal regime. By ignoring the warnings of the most lucid observers, France bore overwhelming responsibility in a spiral that led to the worst, he said.France has a role, a story and a political responsibility to Rwanda. She has a duty: to face history head-on and recognise the suffering she has inflicted on the Rwandan people by too long valuing silence over the examination of the truth. The tone of his speech reflected closely the conclusions of an independent report released in April he commissioned and which concluded that France bore heavy and overwhelming  responsibility for not doing more to stop the genocide but that it was not complicit in the slaughter.Shortly afterwards Rwanda released its own report that found France was aware a genocide was being prepared and bore responsibility for enabling it, continuing in its unwavering support for Rwanda\u0027s then president, Juvenal Habyarimana.It was the shooting down of Mr Habyarimana\u0027s plane that unleashed the 100-day frenzy of killings.French officials armed, advised, trained, equipped, and protected the Rwandan government, the report concluded, adding that France covered up its role for years.Observers said that while the trip will draw criticism from critics of Rwanda\u0027s authoritarian regime, it will help to normalise relations with the country after decades of frosty ties.On Friday, the Elysée Palace said Mr Macron would name a new ambassador to Rwanda, the first accredited French envoy since 2015.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn

coronavirus vaccines cause","story":"Scientists in Germany believe they have discovered why the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson coronavirus vaccines cause potentially fatal blood clots in rare cases, and claim the issue can be fixed with a minor adjustment.The authors of a new study claim their findings show that it is not the key component of the vaccines that cause the clotting, but a separate vector virus that is used to deliver them to the body.Both the AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson jabs use a modified adenovirus, similar to the common cold virus, to deliver the spike protein of SarsCov2, the virus that causes Covid-19.The scientists claim the delivery mechanism means the spike protein is sent into the cell nucleus rather than the cellular fluid, where the virus usually generates proteins.In rare cases, they argue, parts of the spike protein can splice inside the nucleus, creating mutant versions which do not bind to the cell membrane where immunisation takes place, but are secreted into the body, where they can cause blood clots.Dangerous clots in the brain have been recorded in 309 cases out of 33m people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, and there have been 56 deaths. “The adenovirus life cycle includes... the entry of the adenoviral DNA into the nucleus, and subsequently gene transcription by the host transcription machinery,” the scientists claimed in a preprint of the study released this week.“And exactly here lies the problem: the viral piece of DNA… is not optimised to be transcribed inside the nucleus.”But Prof Rolf Marschalek of Frankfurt’s Goethe University, the leader of the study, claims the issue can be easily fixed by modifying the spike protein to prevent it splitting.“With the data we have in our hands we can tell the companies how to mutate these sequences, coding for the spike protein in a way that prevents unintended splice reactions,” Prof Marsalek told the Financial Times.He claimed Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has already been in contact with his lab about a potential fix, but said he had not spoken to AstraZeneca.“They never contacted us so we never spoke to them, but if they do I can tell them what to do to make a better vaccine,” he said.Prof Marschalek’s claims are only one of a number of hypotheses currently being explored on why the jabs cause blood clots in some people.A rival German study led by Prof Andreas Greinacher of Greifswald University Hospital claimed the clots were being caused by EDTA, a chemical used as a preservative in the AstraZeneca vaccine.In a two-step process, the vaccine can cause an overreaction by the immune system in some people which causes too many platelets to form in the blood, Prof Greinacher argues.EDTA can cause the cells in blood vessels to become “leaky”, causing platelets and proteins to flood through the body, triggering a massive immune reaction that can cause the blood clots.“There is, in my opinion, rock-solid evidence,” Prof Greinacher claimed in April.EDTA is not listed as an ingredient in the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine but Prof Greinacher said he believes the phenomenon may be common to all vector vaccines.A third German study released in preprint this week by scientists at Ulm University Medical Centre claims to have found unusually high levels of proteins in the AstraZeneca vaccine which it is theorized could be behind the clots.“The often-observed strong clinical reaction one or two days after vaccination is likely associated with the detected protein impurities,” the authors of the study wrote.The type of proteins involved “are known to affect innate and acquired immune responses and to intensify existing inflammatory reactions,”  Prof Stefan Kochanek, the study leader, said.  “They have also been linked to autoimmune reactions.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The

potentially live to be 150 years old, scientists have concluded in a groundbreaking new study.However, any hopes Silicon Valley billionaires might have of making themselves immortal were dashed.Researchers said 150 was the absolute limit any healthy human body would be able to sustain.Thousands of volunteers in the US and UK contributed data to the study which looked at both blood samples and daily step counts, which were collected using an iPhone app.Scientists measured how long it takes the body to recover from stresses, analysing blood cell counts and daily step numbers. Recovery times deteriorated with age.Using artificial intelligence they were able to measure the lessening resilience of the body, and extrapolate the changes over time to the point where it would cease to have any resilience.Heather Whitson, director of the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging, who was not involved in the study, told Scientific American: They are asking the question of \u0027What’s the longest life that could be lived by a human complex system if everything else went really well, and it’s in a stress-free environment?’In doing so the study established a pace of ageing which could be used to predict the outer limit of what was possible.Read more: Human ageing process biologically reversed in world firstThe study, published in Nature Communications, was carried out by Singapore-based company Gero, in collaboration with the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York.Findings from the blood samples and step counts painted exactly the same future, the study found.It said ageing manifested itself as a progressive functional decline and resilience would be ultimately lost at the age in the range of 120–150 years, thus indicating the absolute limit of human life.The report said: We therefore argue that the loss of resilience cannot be avoided even in the most successfully ageing iniduals.Currently, the oldest human being ever recorded was Jeanne Calment, a French woman who died in 1997 at the age of 122.That was 28 years short of what the study predicted as the absolute limit for humans.Average global life expectancy is currently 73. In 1950 it was 47.The steady increase has contributed to a belief among some that it can be pushed ever higher through health and fitness initiatives.Numerous wealthy iniduals and companies have begun looking at ways to increase life. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire entrepreneur, has funded anti-ageing research and declared himself against death.Google has also backed a company aiming to extend longevity.The Gero study said: Healthy human subjects turned out to be very resilient.But it added: If the trend holds at later ages the extrapolation shows a complete loss of human body resilience, that is the ability to recover, at some age around 120-150-years-old.The reduced resilience was observed even in iniduals not suffering from major chronic diseases.Dr Andrei Gudkov, a co-author of the study, said: It explains why even the most effective prevention and treatment of age-related diseases could only improve the average, but not the maximal, life unless true anti-ageing therapies have been developed.The scientists suggested it was possible the absolute limit could be increased in the future. Gero co-founder Dr Peter Fedichev said: Measuring something is the first step before producing an intervention.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"left rabid dog life like ordinary belarusians trapped country","story":"Europe and Britain have moved to ban flights to and from Belarus to punish Alexander Lukashenko for effectively hijacking a Ryanair flight in order to arrest a dissident journalist. But many Belarusians who oppose Mr Lukashenko and have suffered under his rule fear they are about to become even more isolated. Maxim, a 33-year-old artist currently living at an artists residence in Vienna, was due to fly back home to Minsk next month but now is not sure how he would get back.“Minsk airport used to be the only way to get out of the country,” said Maxim, a 33-year old artist who was meant to fly back to Minsk after completing a residency in Vienna next month. “The EU ban for Belavia is a direct blow against ordinary people and civil society. They have isolated and left us with a rabid dog,” he said, referring to the president of 26 years. The regime doesn’t give a damn about Belavia because they have been slapped with visa bans as it is.”In a list of sanctions announced on Tuesday, the European Council called on member states to close their airspace and airports to Belarusian carriers, and stop their own airlines from flying to or over Belarus. Latvia and Poland (along with non-EU members Britain and Ukraine) have already banned their own airlines from flying to and from Belarus, resulting in cancelled flights to Warsaw and Riga. The measures have been welcomed by Belarusian opposition leaders including Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled former presidential  candidate who many Belarusians believe was the legitimate winner of August\u0027s election. Speaking to the European Parliament on Thursday, she urged MEPs to stick to the proposed sanctions and not be tempted to return to a softly-softly policy. “The EU approach of gradually elevating pressure on the Lukashenko regime hasn\u0027t managed to change its behaviour and only led to a growing sense of impunity and massive repressions,“ she said. But many ordinary Belarusians, including those sympathetic to the opposition, have expressed dismay. The Belarusian government imposed stiff restrictions on crossing the country’s land borders citing fears of Covid-19 that Mr Lukashenko otherwise routinely dismisses as insignificant, making it almost impossible to drive or take the train into neighbouring Poland and Lithuania. And the recent arrests of several Belarusian dissidents in Russia, which has a visa free regime with Belarus and has previously served as an escape route for opponents of Mr Lukashenko, has also left many wary of travelling via Moscow. Many fleeing Mr Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on the opposition have in recent months taken the short flight to Warsaw or Vilnius instead, and they now fear that door closing.“People on both sides of the border found themselves in a cage,” said Volha Neskladovskaya-Tereshkova, 28, who moved to Poland with her family in March.Everyone opposed to the Lukashenko regime “has been waiting for harsh sanctions for so long: But now that it happened, the sanctions are not really against the regime but against ordinary people,” she said. Ms Neskladovskaya-Tereshkova is typical of thousands of opposition-leaning Belarusians who have sought refuge in Europe following the terrifying and indiscriminate crackdown Mr Lukashenko unleashed after a disputed elections in August. Her husband, an IT specialist, was grabbed by riot police at an election-night protest and was repeatedly beaten and humiliated in custody before he was released three days later. Investigators declined to open a criminal probe when he complained about the beatings. The couple and their toddler left the country when secured a Polish work visa. Now, she says, she has no idea when she will next see her parents. She’s also not sure what to do about the family corgi, which is still in Minsk and which her brother was meant to bring to Warsaw in the coming weeks. “We’d probably have to do it via Russia but it’s not easy flying with a dog.”“It feels like a trap.  Land borders are closed and now planes won’t fly. In the past, if you were in danger, you could relocate to Poland or Lithuania, and the flights were cheap, fast and open to us, said  Marina Sokolova, a 46-year old freelance journalist in Minsk. Nonetheless, she insisted she could see the point of the sanctions and said she could bear them - provided all these steps contribute to change in Belarus.I’m a journalist and many of my friends are now in prison and what are our inconveniences caused by the ban in comparison to their suffering in prison. It is a double edged sword. We are trapped but we understand that this is one step to our freedom,” she said.  The anger is also spilling onto social media, with many wondering how isolation will harm the regime. Talks around passenger flights tofrom Belarus are a celebration of human indifference, Andrey Vozyanov, a Minsk based musician, wrote on Facebook. Belarusians whom I know had long feared of being sealed off, but few expected it coming from outside.European diplomats are certainly aware of the issue. German officials raised the possible impact on members of the Belarusian opposition trying to get out of the country during the talks that led up to Tuesday\u0027s statement on sanctions. And a French proposal to sever all land transportation links with Belarus was shot down by other nations who considered it too drastic and likely to hurt ordinary people. The full closure of EU airports to Belavia, the national carrier most Belarusian travellers rely on, will only come into effect after ministers and bureaucrats hammer out the legal details, which could take weeks. Minsk airport continued to schedule Belavia flights to and from EU destinations including  Amsterdam, Milan, Tallin, Vienna and Warsaw remained scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday. Flights will continue to Russia and most other former Soviet states remain unaffected, as well as major non-European hubs including Istanbul. Belavia currently flies non-stop from London Gatwick to Minsk three times weekly on an Embraer 195. A total of 13 flights from London to Minsk (one way) are scheduled to depart in June 2021, according to Cirium, a company that collates aviation industry data. Andrei Sannikov, a former presidential candidate and opposition leader who fled Belarus after being beaten and jailed in 2011, said concerns about the consequences for ordinary people were legitimate. But he argued that the measures were necessary and marked a long overdue recognition that more than two decades of trying to engage with Mr Lukashenko\u0027s regime had failed. “Yes I am worried about the impact on ordinary people, but I have not heard anyone really complaining about it so far. When I speak to people, they generally say they are willing to endure a little pain if they can finally get rid of this psychopath,” he said by telephone from Warsaw, where he now lives. The main thing is that Europe has finally realised Lukashenko is a threat to everyone. They previously tried to treat Belarus as a humanitarian issue, not as a security issue, and that did not work, he said. Ms Neskladovskaya is not so sure. “Europe wants to ensure safety for its own citizens: but who’s going to ensure our safety? she said. People got shut out and they have no idea how to get out of the country if they need to.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"starmer may get poll boost cummings fiasco shouldnt trust","story":"Historical parallels can be overdone. Such is the bizarre nature of dramas we’ve seen in the last five or six years that it becomes a challenging task to dredge the history books to find comparable examples of today’s crises.But as the dust settles on Dominic Cummings’ testimony to a select committee of MPs, there may be one event from the (fairly) recent past that might present a couple of lessons, not so much for the government or the prime minister, but for Keir Starmer. By the start of 1986, the omens for Neil Kinnock as a future prime minister were not looking auspicious. Despite an initial flurry of excitement at his elevation to the leadership in the wake of Labour’s (at the time) worst electoral result since 1935, Kinnock had suffered a number of setbacks. The 1984-85 miners’ strike had exposed his unwillingness to stand against illegal and violent picketing for fear of splitting the entire movement, a failure the prime minister, Margaret thatcher, had deftly exploited.Other splits, over the Militant tendency’s attempt to bankrupt Liverpool City Council and an attempt by the miners’ leader, Arthur Scargill, to commit a future Labour government to retrospectively exonerate all miners found guilty of picket line violence, hardly helped Kinnock’s efforts to present the party as a responsible alternative to Thatcher.And then, at the start of 1986, came Westland, which started as a minor scuffle over the ownership of a British helicopter manufacturer before blowing up into one of the biggest crises of the Thatcher government. The defence secretary, Michael Heseltine, dramatically walked out of a cabinet meeting to protest the prime minister’s refusal to take his side in favour of a European buy-out (as opposed to the American one Mrs Thatcher favoured) and announced to the waiting media outside that he had indeed resigned from the cabinet. The trade and industry secretary, Leon Brittan, was eventually caught up in the web of intrigue and was obliged to submit his own resignation. Thatcher had never looked more vulnerable. An opinion poll published by the  gave Kinnnock’s Labour a big enough lead to secure it a 65-seat majority in the Commons in the event of an early general election – the biggest lead he would enjoy up until the poll tax controversy in 198990.For Kinnock, Westland was an unexpected boost to a leadership that had simply not cut through until then. Labour’s continuing weak performance in the polls had already convinced many that he would never see the inside of Number 10 Westland changed that impression. For a while.We must await the impact on the polls to see if Cummings’ allegations of incompetence and dishonesty on the part of Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock have any lasting effect on the governing party’s popularity, or on voters’ enthusiasm for Starmer’s Labour Party. The lesson Starmer should take from Westland is that any bump in the polls for his party could well prove as fleeting as it was in 1986.Thatcher limped through most of 1986 like a wounded wildebeest, as rumours about a Heseltine challenge to her leadership swirled around her. The public image of invulnerability had been shattered. But at her party’s conference in October, she somehow managed to turn everything around with a stirring, defiant speech that played well to her party’s base and beyond. Labour lost its lead and didn’t recover it until well after the 1987 general election was lost on a similar scale to 1983’s defeat.The parallel with today only goes so far. Johnson is a very different leader from Thatcher and has never had to depend on an air of resolute impregnability. It’s also not clear whether his mammoth lead over Labour will be reversed as a consequence of Cummings’ attack. The parallels to be drawn between Kinnock and Starmer, on the other hand, are undeniable. Starmer has found it as difficult as Kinnock to open up a healthy polling lead and convince the electorate that he is ready to serve as prime minister. Like Kinnock, Starmer depends too much on the government failing on its own terms rather than presenting an inspiring alternative vision of a Labour Britain.His only consolation at this point is that political parallels, in these unpredictable times, don’t tell us as much as we would like. Which for Starmer may be a blessing.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"5 questions matt hancock must","story":":root  questions Matt Hancock must answer today after Cummings brands him a liarReliable ornot, Dominic Cummings has raised some important allegations about Matt Hancock and tens of thousands of care home deaths.

The Health Secretary was branded a liar who should have been sacked  to  times in an explosive Commons hearing. And most gravely, he was accused of misleading the PM about the situation in care homes before tens of thousands died. Mr Hancock will come out fighting today, with a .am debate in the Commons and a pm press conference. He has already issued a statement through his team, failing to refute any specic allegation but just saying: “We absolutely reject Mr. Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary. “At all times throughout this pandemic [Hancock] and everyone in DHSC has worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives.” His supporters will write off Dominic Cummings ’ claims as the ravings of an embittered controversialist who lost his job - and point out he carefully avoided criticising potential leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove.But regardless of whether Cummings is a reliable witness, his statements do raise important questions for the Health Secretary. No doubt Mr Hancock will today make a broad-brush dismissal or denial of Cummings’ claims. Buthe doesn’t engage in the detail of these questions, you might need to raise an eyebrow or two. How long did you know new care home residents weren’t being routinely tested Covid was allowed to flow into care homes during a crucial month last year in which routine testing halted due to lack of capacity. Residents, new arrivals and staff with symptoms were not routinely tested from mid-March, when community testing ended, to April . Until April , not even new arrivals from hospitals were being routinely tested. More than a quarter of England’s Covid deaths have been in care homes, including many thousands in the first wave. Mr Hancock would later claim: “Right from the start we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes.” But how true was that - and when did he realise the virus was being seeded into the care system  Yesterday Mr Cummings revealed he and the PM - who were steamrollered by Covid in that crucial month - didn’t know for weeks that people were leaving hospital without being routinely tested.The ex-aide said: “He [ Boris Johnson ] came back after being ill - what on earth has happened with all these people in care homes  “Hancock told us in the Cabinet room that people were going to be tested in care homes. What the hell happened ” He added: “It was only in April after the Prime Minister and I had both ourselves been ill that we realised that what we were told never did happen, or only happened very partially and sporadically”. He went on: “The government rhetoric was ‘we put a shield around care homes, blah blah blah’ - that was complete nonsense. “Quite the opposite of putting a shield round them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.”Was it true that everyone got the treatment they needed Mr Cummings said: “In the summer he said everyone who needed treatment got the treatment they required. “He knew that was a lie because he’d been briefed by the Chief Scientic Advisor and the Chief Medical Officer himself about the first peak. “And we were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved. Many people were left to die in horric circumstances.” Mr Cummings did not point to exactly where Mr Hancock made the comments and we were unable to find them last night. But it raises questions about whether he nished the truth when claiming the NHS was never “overwhelmed” by Covid. Did you ‘criminally’ interfere with Test and Trace to meet your own target Mr Cummings accused the Health Secretary of criminal, disgraceful interference with the Test and Trace scheme to meet his ”stupid testing target of , per day last year. Mr Cummings told MPs: In my opinion, disastrously, [Matt Hancock] had made - while the PM was on his near deathbed - this pledge to do , [tests a day] by the end of April. This was an incredibly stupid thing to do because we already that goal internally. When he ed to work after having Covid himself, Mr Cummings said he started receiving calls from people who said: Hancock is interfering with the building of the Test and Trace system because heaposs telling everybody what to do to maximise his chances of hitting his stupid target by the end of the month.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeDominic Cummings has given a searing assessment of incompetence, failure and arrogance at the top of government as the Covid- pandemic killed thousands of people “who didn’t need to die”.In a seven-hour marathon appearance at a joint Committee of MPs, Boris Johnson ’s former top aide said his old boss had ‘ignored advice’ and was late to introduce both the first and second lockdowns.Mr Cummings claimed the PM was consistently anti-lockdown, ignored scientic advice and failed to take Covid seriously - even ranting last summer that he should never have done Lockdown .MPs heard that No  was warned the UK was “absolutely f****d” and coronavirus would “kill thousands of people” as Mr Johnson dragged his feet over bringing in the first lockdown last year - something Cummings said he “bitterly” regrets.He painted a picture of a chaotic and dysal Downing Street in denial over the scale of the disaster ahead.  Mr Cummings also turned his guns on Carrie Symonds, suggesting she had pursued “completely unethical and clearly illegal” attempts to pack No  with her own friends. But his most vicious broadsides were reserved for Health Secretary Matt Hancock, whom he branded “disgraceful” - and potentially “criminal.” Mr Cummings said there were around  reasons why Mr Hancock should have been thrown out of the Cabinet - including, he claimed, lying both in meetings and publicly.But he had no such venom for Brexiteer allies Dominic Raab, Michael Gove - and particularly Rishi Sunak, whom he described as “competent and extremely able”.With Mr Sunak long touted as a future leader, and Mr Cummings having a string of personal scores to settle, that will raise questions over the motivation behind his claims today. Questions also remain over Mr Cummings reliability, after he introduced yet another explanation of his trip to Durham at the height of the first lockdown, and claimed the borders should have been shut since January despite doing little work on Covid by then. That said, his evidence raises serious questions for Boris Johnson - and is almost impossible to wade through. So to break things into bite-sized chunks, here are the all most explosive moments in his testimony to ParliamentTens of thousands of Brits died needlessly due to government failureIn what’s ultimately his most damning admission, the ex-adviser said bluntly: Tens of thousands of people died, who didnapost need to die. Mr Cummings claimed the PM was consistently anti-lockdown, ignored scientic advice and failed to take Covid seriously. The former top aide began his evidence with a mea culpa: “The truth is senior ministers, officials and advisers like me fell short of standards the public has a right to expect. “When the public needed us most, we failed. I’d like to say to all the families how sorry I am for the mistakes we made”. PM had no idea for weeks that Covid was flowing into care homesMr Cummings revealed Boris Johnson had no idea for weeks that people leaving hospital into care weren’t being routinely tested in late March. That led to the virus being seeded into care homes and tens of thousands of residents dying. Blaming the Health Secretary, he told MPs: “[Matt] Hancock told us in the Cabinet room that people were going to be tested in care homes. What the hell happened ” He added: “It was only in April after the Prime Minister and I had both ourselves been ill that we realised that what we were told never did happen, or only happened very partially and sporadically”. He went on: “The government rhetoric was ‘we put a shield around care homes, blah blah blah’ - that was complete nonsense. “Quite the opposite of putting a shield round them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.”  A top official admitted ‘we’re f*****, we’re going to kill thousands’ -  days before lockdownA top No official warned “we’re absolutely f****d” as the Covid response descended into chaos, he claimed - but it still took another  days to lock down. Until the second week of March the consensus in No was that there was no point locking down because it would only delay the inevitable peak. But he claimed former Deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen Macnamara voiced early doubts. She allegedly said another top official, Mark Sweeney, had told her: “I’ve been told for years there is a whole plan for this. There is no plan. We’re in huge trouble.” Mr Cummings said Ms Macnamara told him on March : “I think we are absolutely f****d. I think this country is heading for a disaster, I think we are going to kill thousands of people.” Boris Johnson thought it was all just a ‘scare story’Mr Cummings argued it would not have been helpful for his boss to attend emergency COBRA meetings in February - five of which he missed - because he would have had flippant responses to the crisis. “The basic thought was that in February the Prime Minister regarded this as just a scare story,” said Mr Cummings. “He described it as the new swine flu.”He could’ve boasted he would be injected with Covid on TVMr Cummings insisted he “definitely” told Mr Johnson the coronavirus was not just a scare story. But in a shocking claim, he told MPs: “The view of ious officials inside No waswe have the Prime Minister chairing COBRA meetings and he just tells everyone ‘it’s swine flu, don’t worry about it, I’m going to get Chris Whitty to inject me live on TV with coronavirus so everyone realises it’s nothing to be frightened of’, that would not help actually serious planning.” Boris Johnson was told to encourage ‘chicken pox parties’ for herd immunityMr Cummings made an equally explosive allegation about then-Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill. On March , he said, “the Cabinet Secretary said ‘Prime Minister, you should go on TV tomorrow ad explain to people the herd immunity and that it’s like the old chicken pox parties - we need people to get this disease because that’s how we get herd immunity by September’. “And I said Mark you’ve got to stop using this chicken pox analogy it’s not right, and he said ‘why’. “And [data scientist] Ben Warner said ‘because chicken pox isn’t spreading exponentially and killing hundreds of thousands of people.’” Mr Cummings added: “He was saying what the official advice to him from the Department of Health was.” That day, Chief Scientist Patrick Vallance told the nation suppressing the virus completely was not “desirable” because some immunity was needed. And Boris Johnson told the nation “many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.” The nation’s top civil servant wanted Matt Hancock sacked for ‘lies’Matt Hancock should have been fired for at least - things during the Covid crisis, Mr Cummings told MPs. In an extraordinary attack, he accused the Health Secretary of lying to everybody on multiple occasions - including in the Cabinet room. He said he and Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, had both personally urged the Prime Minister to sack Mr Hancock after he “performed far, far disastrously below the standards the country has a right to expect”. He said the “lies” included claiming everyone had got the treatment they needed in the first wave, despite being “explicitly told” that was untrue and “many people were left to die in horric circumstances”. They also included telling Cabinet “everything is fine on PPE, we’ve got it all covered”, before then blaming blockages on the Chancellor and NHS chief Simon Stevens. Mr Cummings said he asked Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill to investigate Mr Hancock’s blame claims, but “the Cabinet Secretary came back to me and said ‘it’s completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the Secretary of State’s honesty in these meetings.’”  No today insisted Boris Johnson has full confidence in his Health Secretary but refused to comment on specic claims. Mr Hancockaposs team said they reject Mr Cummingsapos claims, but didnapost specy which ones exactly. A spokesman for Mr Hancock said: “We absolutely reject Mr. Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary. “The Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.” No were distracted because Donald Trump wanted Britain to bomb IraqMr Cummings said March  was the most “surreal” day of his time in government. Just as he was waking up to the danger of No’s “delay the peak” plan, he claimed, “suddenly the national security people came in and said Trump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonight. “And we need to start having meetings about that through the day with COBRA as well. “So everything to do with COBRA that day on Covid was completely disrupted.” He added: “Fortunately, thank God, the attorney general persuaded the PM not to go along with the whole bombing campaign.”Carrie Symonds demanded No staff ert their time to concentrate on her dogMr Cummings went on: “And then to add, it sounds so surreal it couldn’t possibly be true, that day the Times had run a huge story about the Prime Minister and his girlfriend and their dog. “And the Prime Minister’s girlfriend was going completely crackers about this story.and demanding that the press office deal with that. “So we had this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying are we going to bomb Iraq, part of the building was arguing about whether or not we’re going to do quarantine or not, the Prime Minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial, and you have all these meetings going on through the course of the th.”  He accused Carrie Symonds of ‘illegal’ actsMr Cummings, who eventually quit in November, said: ”My resignation was definitely connected to the fact that the Prime Ministeraposs girlfriend was trying to change a whole bunch of dferent appointments in No and appoint her friends to particular jobs. In particular she was trying to overturn the outcome of an official process about hiring a particular job in a way which was not only completely unethical but was also clearly illegal. I thought the whole process about how the Prime Minister was behaving at that point was appalling and all of that was definitely part of why I went.  He branded the PM ‘unfit for the job’Mr Cummings said the main reason was because his relationship with Boris Johnson was already finished by October. He said he blamed the PM for the second wave thanks to his flat refusal to lock down for a second time in September. He told MPs: Fundamentally I regarded him as unfit for the job. “I was trying to create a structure around him to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions, and push other things through against his wishes. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mediaGridDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,smallerFloatParkVideo:true,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,emxDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,bundledCss:,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,tcfVersion:,codesplit:,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,ampQuantcastCMPEnabled:true,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,delayAdsUntilConsented:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,prebid.sendAllBids:true,loginRadius:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,prebid.sendHBKeys:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,enableUserProfile:true,improvedigitalDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,standaloneMpu:true,smartAdServerDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,verizonDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,jwplayer.float.mode.always:true,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableCallToActionBar:true,noticationTrayEnabled:true,richaudienceDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,apiCommentCountEnabled:true,swipeNavigation:true,fundingChoicesEnabled:true,customAdExperience:true,adFixedTopSlot:true,viafouraSectionUuid:----edc,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,prebidAds:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,video.jwplayer.rame.playerId:yozc,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,ixDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,commentCountEnabled:true,lotameMantisDisabled:,video.imaVersion:.,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,delayVideoAdsUntilConsented:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,experiment:,modyEmbedConfig:\"Cummings raised alarm over PM’s strategy -  days before lockdownMr Cummings said his “mounting panic” began on March  last year when he sent a text to a group including the PM. The next morning, at .am, he said he texted Mr Johnson: “We’ve got big problems coming. “The Cabinet Office is terryingly s***, no plans, totally behind the pace. “We must announce today not next week -you feel ill with cold or flu, stay home… We are looking at ,-, deaths between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.”  He said he then sat down with his favoured experts at pm on March , when they “hit the total panic button” and told him “we’re heading for total and utter catastrophe, we need to have Plan B.” Yet he said he only then told Mr Johnson on March  - nine days before lockdown - “you are going to have to lock down”. He admitted this three-day gap was not good enough. “It was a huge failing of mine and I bitterly regret that I didn’t hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did,” he told MPs.There was simply no plan for lockdownMr Cummings said he told the PM on March : “There is no lockdown plan. It doesn’t exist. SAGE haven’t modelled it. [The Health Department] don’t have a plan. We are going to have to figure out and hack together a lockdown plan.” He said by March , when there was “pushback” about ordering people with coughs to stay at home, he believed “the system is basically delaying announcing all of these things because there’s not a proper plan in place.” Officials also dodged locking down because they thought the public wouldn’t accept it. But that was clearly “”, and he said he realised that when family members were texting pleading for information.Key people were off skiing when coronavirus took hold“The government itself and No was not operating on a war footing in February on this in any way, shape or form,” he said. “Lots of key people were literally skiing in the middle of February. It wasn’t until the last week of February that there was any sense of urgency, I would say.” Mr Cummings said claims about extensive preparations for a pandemic were ”basically completely hollow” and “we didn’t figure this out until the back end of February”.Boris Johnson’s refusal to lock down in September was a personal crusadeDominic Cummings rehearsed the well-known arguments that Boris Johnson refused pleas to lock down for a second time in September, only doing it from November .“He wasn’t taking any advice. He was making the decisions himself,” he said. “The Cabinet wasn’t involved...there wasn’t any formal Cabinet meeting to discuss it. Orthere was, it was a purely Potemkin exercise.” The PM had decided he was protecting the economy, and Mr Cummings said “we could not persuade him thatyou basically took the view of ‘let it rip’”, it would lead to an economic and health “disaster.” Mr Johnson later used the phrase “let it rip” as a catchphrase to showcase the kind of approach he would not take.The government was turning down ventilators in late March because prices were jacked upMr Cummings told MPs: “I think it was the day the PM tested positive… the th [of March] I think. “In that meeting we were told at the Cabinet table by officials that the Department of Health had been turning down ventilators because the price had been marked up. “It completely beggars belief that that sort of thing was happening.”No staff drew up a whiteboard asking who they couldn’t ‘save’Mr Cummings spent the days in the run-up to his appearance dripping information on his Twitter feed - including a photo of a whiteboard last March.He said the scribblings were the first sketch of a Plan B, PM study. One noticeable line at the bottom has caused a stir - where it said aposwho do we not save apos. aposNotapos has been underlined. Explaining the remark, Mr Cummings said “we were already partly over the clf” and it reflected the reality of the unfolding pandemic.  Cummings accused Hancock of ‘criminal behaviour’ over his ‘stupid target’Mr Cummings accused the Health Secretary of criminal, disgraceful interference with the Test and Trace scheme to meet a stupid testing target of , per day. Mr Cummings told MPs: In my opinion, disastrously, [Matt Hancock] had made - while the PM was on his near deathbed - this pledge to do , [tests a day] by the end of April. This was an incredibly stupid thing to do because we already that goal internally. When he ed to work after having Covid himself, Mr Cummings said he started receiving calls from people who said: Hancock is interfering with the building of the Test and Trace system because heaposs telling everybody what to do to maximise his chances of hitting his stupid target by the end of the month. He added: In my opinion he shouldaposve been fired for that thing alone. That itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by dferent parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in dferent ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say aposlook at me and my k targetapos. It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm.Cummings thought about quitting and going on TV to accuse PM of killing thousands The ex-aide said he should have resigned much earlier, and “I thought about it in March. “If we hadn’t successfully bounced things in March  I had talked to ious people during that week about saying to him that I will resign and hold a press conference and say the government’s going to kill hundreds of thousands of people. “I had similar conversations with people in September.” In the end, though, he quit in what critics say is a childish power struggle over who pulled the strings at No.‘Thousands’ of people would do a better job than ‘donkey’ Prime MinisterMr Cummings said it was “crackers” that either he or Boris Johnson had their jobs, “thousands” of Brits could do it better, and hero nurses were “lions led by donkeys”.He added: “There’s a very profound question about the nature of our political system that means we got at the last election a choice between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson.“I think any system which ends up giving a choice between two people like that to lead is obviously a system that’s gone extremely badly wrong.” He added: “In any sensible rational government it is completely crazy that I should have been in such a senior position in my personal opinion. “I’m not smart. I’ve not built great things in the world. It’s completely crackers that someone like me should have been in there, just as it’s crackers that Boris was in there and the choice at the last election was Jeremy Corbyn.” “The problem in this crisis was very much lions led by donkeys over and over again.”  The PM DID say ‘let the bodies pile high’Boris Johnson DID make infamous comments about ‘bodies piling high’, Dominic Cummings declared. He said he heard the Prime Minister make the remarks, originally reported as “no more f*****g lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands”, in the PM’s study shortly after his decision to implement a second lockdown on  October . That raises serious questions over Boris Johnsonaposs honesty. The PM has denied on the record and to Parliament that he made the remarks, saying the claims were “total, total rubbish”. There was a version of it in the Sunday Times, which was not accurate. But the version that the BBC reported was accurate, Mr Cummings said. I heard that in the Prime Ministeraposs study. That was not in September though, that was immediately after he finally made the decision to do the lockdown on October .Boris Johnson wanted to be like the mayor in Jaws - with no border controlsMr Cummings said he had a fractious meeting with the PM in July  when he flat refused to introduce border controls to stop a second wave. He said: He added: “He had the Dailywith their stupid campaign on the whole subject, he had Tory MPs going crackers about it at the same time. “And essentially at that point he was in ‘we should never have done lockdown, I should have been the mayor of Jaws [who kept the beaches open], now I’m going to be, open everything up, get on with it’. “And me and others just could not win that argument.  “We never won the argument - as of today. Look at the whole thing about iants. We still don’t have a proper border policy.” No said it would “obviously refute” that the border policy was too weak now, saying: “We have some of the toughest border measures in the world and we have taken action whenever necessary to keep the public safe.Boris Johnson ranted that the first lockdown should never have happenedHe also explosively claimed the PM ranted “we should never have done lockdown ” and any border control would ruin the travel industry. Mr Cummings went on: “To which of course some of us said, there’s not going to be a tourism industry in the Autumnwe have a second wave.’ The whole logic is completely wrong. “There was just no fundamentally good logic to not shutting the borders in January in my opinion and there was never any logic to it after April.”Boris Johnson is a ’disaster zone’ who changes his mind constantly like a ‘shopping trolley’In a blistering personal attack, he said Mr Johnson “made some terrible decisions and got things wrong and then constantly U-turned on everything” Mr Cummings told MPs: “The reason for all these problems was bad policy, bad decisions, bad planning, bad operational capability. “It doesn’t matteryou’ve got great people doing communicationsthe Prime Minister changes his mind  times a day and then calls up the media and contradicts his own policy day after day. “You’re going to have a communications disaster zone.” He added: “You cannot keep changing your mind every time thewrites an editorial on the subject… nobody could find a way around the problem of the PM like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the island to the other.” The PM ‘laughed’ and said chaos is good because it makes him look more powerfulIn his summer  conversation with the PM, Mr Cummings claimed he said: “This whole system is chaos, this building is chaos, You are more frightened of me having the power to stop the chaos than you are afraid of the chaos.” He told MPs: “The PM laughed and said ‘you’re right, I am more frightened of you having the power to stop the chaos than I am of the chaos. ‘Chaos isn’t that bad. Chaos means everyone has to look to me to see who’s in charge.’”‘Stupid’ Boris Johnson personally decided to ‘pick a fight’ with Marcus RashfordThe “stupid” PM personally decided to defy footballer Marcus Rashford’s plea for free school meals over half term, against aides’ advice, he said. Mr Cummings told MPs: “The Director of Communications said to the PM twice ‘do not pick a fight with Rashford, obviously we should do this instead’. “The PM decided to pick a fight and then surrendered twice. “After that everyone says ‘your communications are stupid’ - what’s stupid is picking a fight with Rashford over school meals and what should have happened is just getting the school meals policy right.” People in government thought Covid was over and done with last summerMr Cummings said: “From the summer fundamentally the view was ‘we’re past it now, Covid is history’ - which was a terrible, terrible mistake.” Yet curiously he avoided criticising Rishi Sunak, the architect of the ill-fated ‘Eat out to Help Out’ scheme.Cummings just couldn’t help referring to filmsAt one point he told MPs: “You know that Spiderman meme with both Spidermans pointing at each other  It’s like that, but with everybody.” At another he said: “This is like a scene from Independence Day with Jeff Goldblum saying the aliens are here and your whole plan is broken and you need a new plan.” Covid- Bereaved Families For Justice, set up in the wake of the pandemic, blasted Mr Cummings saying: That this information is being unveiled in a pantomime-style spat between Cummings and Johnson, littered with independence day, Jeff Goldblum and spiderman references, is utterly inappropriate and makes this even more appalling.”Boris Johnson slammed for ‘terrible’ decision to delay Covid inquiry Boris Johnson today angrily rejected Labour ’s demand to bring forward a Covid inquiry to this summer, saying: “No! As I’ve said before I’m not going to concentrate valuable official time on that now while we’re still battling a pandemic.”But Mr Cummings said: “I think the idea that a serious inquiry, a lessons learned, doesnapost start until next year is completely terrible. “The families... tens of thousands of people died who didnapost need to die. Thereaposs absolutely no excuse for delaying that. “Because a lot of the reasons for why that happened are still in place now. Look at the whole debate about iants and what not. This has to be honestly explained.” He added: “If Number  today wonapost tell the truth about the official [herd immunity] plan which they briefed the media about and explained on TV a year ago, what on earth  is going on in there now ”Cummings finally admits his lockdown trip undermined public trustDominic Cummings admitted the debacle over his March  lockdown road trip “undermined public confidence” in the government. The former aide “deeply apologised” for the way he presented his farcical press conference in the No rose garden. Mr Cummings said “that whole episode was definitely a major disaster for the government and for the Covid policy.” He added: “I know that my misjudgement caused huge trouble. I deeply apologise for it.”But he refuses to apologise for his -mile road trip last March However, Mr Cummings refused to apologise for his actions - instead revealing he “couldn’t tell the whole story” last year about why he drove  miles in a national lockdown to Durham. He told MPs he had already discussed moving his family out of their London home due to security threats, including a few days before he fell ill with Covid. Around March , he said, he said to his we: “We’ve been discussing it for months - we’ve got to get out of here on Friday”.  For that reason, he said, he decided to “stonewall” the Mirror’s story before U-turning and giving a press conference three days later in the No rose garden, due to demands from Boris Johnson. But he decided not to go into any detail about the security threats because he was still in government. He told MPs: “I ended up giving the whole rose garden thing where what I said was true, but we left out a crucial part of it all. The whole thing was a complete disaster. It undermined public confidence in the whole thing.”Cummings wanted a ‘dictator’ as Prime MinisterOne of the most revealing quotes about his personality, Mr Cummings said: “In a well-run entity what would have happened is, essentially in my opinion, you would have had a kind of dictator in charge of this. “If I’d been Prime Minister I would have said [data expert] Marc Warner is in charge of this whole thing. “He speaks with my authority. He has as close to kingly authority as the state has legally to do stuff, and pushing the barriers of legality.”And to sum it all up… Cummings was branded a ‘disingenuous little f*****’MP Paul Bristow quoted to Mr Cummings an anonymous No claim that heaposs a disingenuous little f*****”. He was actually distracted in mid-February by his ambitions to put Cummings acolytes in every post of power”, the MP suggested. Mr Cummings insisted most stories about his dealings with the civil service were “% nonsense”. But it’s true that large parts of the hearing were eaten up by Mr Cummings talking about his own self-importance and sense of right. One y argument was over whether he did or didn’t retrospectively edit his blog to insert a warning about Covid.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonCabinetNHSCare homesCivil servantsPoliticsCoronavirusDominic Cummings"},{"url":null,"title":"high speed 2 rail line","story":"NewsHigh Speed  rail line will go ahead all the way to Leeds, government confirmsTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the mammoth eastern leg to Leeds will go ahead, but there are still questions about how it is integrated with other plans for Northern Powerhouse RailmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsTransport secretary Grant Shapps on a previous visit to Leeds \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Cabinet Minister tried to ease concerns over the future of High Speed aposs Eastern Leg – and claimed it will go ahead. He told the Policy Exchange think-tank: “We are going to complete HS and include HS on the Eastern Leg to Leeds. “The only question that we have is how to better integrate that with plans which were developed a very long way since HS was first dreamt up all those decades ago – and that pertains to the Northern Powerhouse Rail.” Northern Powerhouse Rail would connect the North’s six big cities – Newcastle, Leeds, Hull, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool and Manchester Airport. Plans for HSaposs eastern flank were thrown into doubt in December after the National Infrastructure Commission said investment should be pumped into regional networks rather than building the full line to Leeds – fuelling fears the mph would not extend to Yorkshire.  Phase  is due to run from London to Birmingham, Phase a from Birmingham to Crewe, and Phase b from Crewe to Manchester, and from Birmingham to Leeds. The Government delayed decisions on the design of the section to Yorkshire until after publication of an Integrated Rail Plan for the North and the Midlands.The blueprint was due to be published last year but the timetable was scuppered by the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Shapps said: “We will report on that soon and it will take into account not only the Eastern Leg but also how that better integrates with Midlands Connect and hub railways, whataposs going through the Northern Powerhouse Rail.” The Transport Secretary said the Government wanted to speed-up the benefits from the Eastern Leg, which experts warned may not be realised until . “We think we can bring that forward quite dramatically by building it in a smarter way, and thataposs what we are looking at through the IRP,” he added. The top Tory, who is also the “Northern Powerhouse Minister” – despite his constituency being in Hertfordshire – claimed he was committed to boosting links across the North He hit out at the time it takes to travel by train between Manchester and Leeds. The journey lasts between  minutes and  minutes. “If that route was in the South East you would get there within  minutes,” he said.  “Butyou go on that train service today it winds along, you end up having to lose hope before you get to your destination. “We want the great northern towns and cities all to be linked up – Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Huddersfield, Hull, Sheffield, Bradford, Newcastle – the whole lot.” Northern Powerhouse Partnership director Henri Murison said: “The Transport Secretary and Minister for the Northern Powerhouse is doing exactly the right thing in promising to deliver the Eastern Leg right the way to Leeds, and we now need government to publicly commit to this in the Integrated Rail Plan as soon as possible. It’s critical to ensuring levelling up is a reality not just rhetoric.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGrant ShappsConservative PartyRailwaysPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock makes inaccurate claim","story":"NewsMatt Hancock makes inaccurate claim immediately after vowing to be straight with UKThe Tory Health Secretary gave incorrect data to Parliament on Boltons vaccination rate, a few minutes after he had vocerously denied Dominic Cummings claims that he is a liarmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY NewsMatt Hancock has insisted he has always been straight with the public \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Health Secretary made the unfortunate exaggeration in Parliament, where minutes earlier he had denied claims from Dominic Cummings that he lied on multiple occasions.He told Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi, whose town of Bolton has been badly hit by the Indian Covid iant: The number of vaccinations happening in Bolton right now is phenomenal, tens of thousands every single day.And it is heartening to see the queues of people coming forward. While the number of jabs in Bolton has indeed soared - roughly quadrupling since the start of May - it is still nowhere near tens of thousands per day. Government data shows that in the last week, the -day rolling average was around a peak of , first doses and , per day, a total of , to , per day. There have been some successful single days, but at , first doses on May  and , second doses on May . Bolton South East MP Ms Qureshi had asked when the Prime Minister and others would be investigated by the police for alleged corporate manslaughter  She spoke after ex-No aide Mr Cummings said tens of thousands of people died who did not need to die in the UK Covid pandemic. She told the Commons: Last week my constituents were wrongly accused of vaccine hesitancy and then we had a quasi-lockdown that no-one knew about and many peopleaposs travel plans were thrown in chaos. My constituents can forgive the Government for that, but I am sure that I speak for the country when I say that we cannot forgive tens of thousands of people who died and didnapost need to die - the chilling words of Dominic Cummings. Will the Secretary of State tell me, when will the Prime Minister and others be investigated by the police for alleged corporate manslaughter and why did we not follow the example of New Zealand where they managed to control it with a minimum number of deaths  Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied: No, but what I would say to the people of Bolton is that - the people of Bolton have again risen to this challenge. Asked about the discrepancy, Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: The data for vaccination rates in Bolton and other areas is published on our dashboard very clearly. And it is right that Bolton is well above the average numbers of vaccinations being carried out daily, which is a testament to the work by the local NHS and the public in Bolton. AskedMr Hancock had misled MPs, the spokesman replied: I haven’t seen the Health Secretary’s comment. What I would point you to is the data published on the dashboard. It does highlight the huge numbers of vaccinations that are being carried out in Bolton. That’s a real success of the surge vaccination programme introduced by the Department of Health and Social Care. Earlier Mr Hancock denied explosive allegations from Dominic Cummings - insisting: Iaposve been straight with people - but did not go into details about his claims.The PMaposs former aide said Mr Hancock should have been sacked on  to  occasions in a bombshell evidence session before MPs on Wednesday. He accused Mr Hancock of lying in meetings and in public, as well as interfering in the rollout of the Test and Trace scheme to meet a stupid testing target. In one of his most serious allegations, Mr Cummings also blamed Mr Hancock for the failure to test patients ing to care homes in the early stages of the pandemic. He said Mr Hancock had insisted people were being tested before going into care homes, only for the PM to find out weeks later that they were not. Mr Hancock told MPs: These... are serious allegations and I welcome the opportunity to come to the House to put formally on the record that these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true. Iaposve been straight with people in public and in private throughout.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHouse of CommonsBoris JohnsonCare homesNursing homesPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"up 30k lives could been","story":"NewsUp to k lives could have been saved by locking down a week earlier, insists expertLockdown architect Professor Neil Ferguson echoed Dominic Cummings claims that tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily because of Government failingsmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY NewsBoris Johnson has come under fire for lockdown down to late in March  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

His comments came after the PMaposs former top aide Dominic Cummings claimed that tens of thousands of people died who didnapost need to die because of the Governmentaposs failings.Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick denied the claims, saying we didnapost have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken. But as ministers scramble to contain the fall out from the explosive seven hour Commons hearing on Wednesday, Prof Ferguson echoed Mr Cummings concern that the Government had been slow to act.  The Imperial College expert told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Had we locked down a week earlier - I said at the time - we would have saved half the lives, that really equates too, it was much earlier in the pandemic, so it equates to , to , lives and I think thataposs unarguable. I mean the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks th to rd of March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives. Prof Ferguson, who advised the Government before quitting for breaking lockdown rules, said scientists became worried in the week leading up to March   about the lack of a clear plan. SAGE experts realised herd immunity would lead to huge number of deaths, with a key meeting was held with the NHS on March  which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really, he said. Prof Ferguson said he wasnapost privy to what officials were thinking within government, but added: I would say from the scientic side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the  of March about the lack of clear, letaposs say,resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing. He also warned that the June  road map hangs in the balance as experts were still concerned about the spread of the Indian iant. Prof Ferguson said: The key issue as to whether we can go forward is: will the surge caused by the Indian iant - and we do think there will be a surge - be more than has been already planned in to the relaxation measures  So it was always expected that relaxation would lead to a surge in infections and to some extent a small third wave of transmission - thataposs inevitableyou allow contact rates in population to go up, even despite immunity -we canapost cope with that being too large. In the next two or three weeks we will be able to come to a firm assessment of whether itaposs possible to go forward.  His comments came as Mr Jenrick said he rejected Mr Cummingsapos claim that tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily during the pandemic. Asked directly whether he thinks that claim is wrong, he said: Yes, I think it is, because you have to remember that we didnapost have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken. Nobody, I think, could doubt for one moment that the Prime Minister was doing anything other than acting with the best of motives with the information and the advice that was available to him.

Hayley and Gary Rolfe said their world came crumbling down when medics discovered their unborn son Cameron had a cm tumour on his left arm eight weeks before he was due.The anxious parents from Middlesbrough described feeling aposnumbapos after discovering their child aposcould possibly have cancerapos, Teesside Live reports.Hayley was monitored for a number of weeks before she was booked in for a caesarean section at Newcastleaposs Royal Victoria Infirmary on April . However, the coupleaposs bundle of joy decided to make an early appearance at just  weeks. Little Cameron was born on April  by emergency c-section at James Cook University Hospital weighing just lb and .oz - but they believe most of that was tumour. The three-week-old is now undergoing treatment where he is expected to remain for between six and  months. Thankfully, doctors have ruled the tumour is not cancerous. Mum-of-two Hayley, , said: I went to a normal growth scan and they found something on the scan that wasnapost right. I went back a couple of days later and they scanned me again and told me and my partner that our baby had a cm tumour. We were transferred to the RVI where we seen the fetal medicine unit. We were at doctors appointments every week.  All the knew was that it was a rare tumour on his left arm and just one in , were diagnosed with it. We were numb, Hayley said. Our world just came crumbling down. Being told your unborn baby might have cancer is just a whole dferent ball game. Doctors booked Hayley in for a caesarean section because of Cameronaposs tumour as they feared she would be unable to give birth naturally because it was bigger than his head. After Cameron was delivered by emergency C-section at James Cook University Hospital he was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary the same night. Due to his condition, Hayley and Gary, , were unable to enjoy the first moments with their baby, including the skin to skin contact, as he was put into an incubator. Hayley was able to see her newborn son twice but was unable to hold him before he was transferred.  Cameron remains in hospital and in his three short weeks has had four blood transfusions, chemotherapy and is on constant antibiotics. Doctors carried out a biopsy on the tumour and found that it was not cancerous and he has since been diagnosed with infantile myofibroma. Cameron still has full use of his arm and doctors hope chemotherapy will shrink the tumour - which may have to be operated on or the limb could possibly be amputated. Hayley added: At the minute because itaposs so big they donapost want to risk operating because heaposs so little. Iaposd say itaposs just as big as his head. Hayley and Gary are able to stay with their newborn son at the hospital but are rotating in order to look after their four-year-old son Fraser at home. Fraser has not been able to meet his baby brother yet. The family have praised the fantastic health care professionals at the Royal Victoria Infirmary who are looking after Cameron. Cameronaposs tumour developed due to a gene in his body and the family did everything they could right during pregnancy. Despite not being related to Cameronaposs condition, Hayley said it is annoying seeing pregnant women smoking when it may potentially harm their babies after she did everything correctly. Hayley has also set up a fundraising page to help with travel costs, food and clothing during Cameronaposs road to recovery.Donations can be made on the apos Cameronaposs survival fundapos page here.

Within hours, Lucca went floppy in his mum’s arms and turned blue as he suffered a coarctation of the aorta, which leaves the heart pumping against a closed door. He needed emergency heart surgery to save his le. Lucca, now six months old, has recovered well but remains in heart failure, and might one day need a transplant because of the damage to his heart in those first delicate weeks of le.His mum has shared harrowing videos of Lucca, at three months, struggling to breathe to raise vital awareness of what heart failure in babies looks like. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror Laura, head of care at a care home, said: There had been a few minor heart issues spotted on my pregnancy scans but cardiologists reassured us it was nothing urgent, and something to keep an eye on as he grew up. When he started fussing with feeds, I flagged it to the midwives coming to check up on us during lockdown in November, but since Lucca was gaining weight well, there wasn’t any concern. Every year, , babies leave UK hospitals with no-one knowing they have a serious heart condition, putting them in grave danger of going into heart failure, the Tiny Tickers charity says.  Sadly, some donapost get the le-saving treatment they need in time, with congenital heart defectsaccounting for up to  per cent of infant deaths. It was only after Lucca’s emergency surgery that Laura, , and her husband James, , learnt the weight their baby had been gaining was not healthy, but in fact fluid retention because of heart failure. Laura, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, said: Lucca was actually losing critical weight but looked chubby because of the water he was retaining. It’s only now I look at the pictures of him hours before his surgery that I can see his face was puffy. Looking back, the new mum recognises the subtle symptoms of heart defects and the resulting heart failure were there with Lucca, but so subtle that they were easily missed. Symptoms can include fussing during eating, being unsettled, a loss of appetite, crying often, and cold hands and feet. Laura said: These are all things than can happen in normal babies too. I had no idea he was so ill. It was incredibly lucky I took him to the GP when I did, as she referred us to the local paediatric team at Horton General Hospital in Oxfordshire and it was there that Lucca went floppy and struggled to breathe. Shallow, fast or strained breathing, where the baby’s chest sucks in with each breath are another vital clue for heart problems. Lucca was rushed by ambulance to a specialist cardiac centre in Southampton General Hospital and underwent heart surgery after his lips turned blue.  His heart rate had shot up to  beats a minute, and his oxygen levels plunged to  despite his laboured breathing, leaving him in a critical condition. The newborn had suffered a coarctation of the aorta, where a small duct in the heart that usually closes after birth had formed extra tissue, causing a narrowing of Lucca’s aorta. It had left his heart working extra hard to pump blood around his body, leading to organ failure. Laura and James rushed to be by their baby’s side. When they arrived, they were met with a sight that will strike fear into the heart of any parent.  Laura said: I will never forget it. Our baby was on this tiny hospital bed, hooked up to so many monitors. There were tubes going into his mouth and body, and I looked at him and thought, aposthis isnapost my babyapos. This is the sort of thing that happens in films, not in real le. Lucca remained on le support in paediatric intensive care for three days. Later, he was slowly weaned off the sedation, which can be seen in another touching video mum Laura captured as her little boy came around.  She can be heard saying hello as Lucca opens his little eyes to his mum’s voice and looks straight at her. Laura said: I could see straight away that the puffiness in his face was going down. Since then, he has come on in leaps and bounds, and to look at him, you’d never know he’s in heart failure. He will need medication to control it and he might need a heart transplant in the future, she added. In the meantime, Laura feels blessed that her little boy has been such a fighter, and is working hard alongside James to raise awareness of congenital heart disease.  She said: The main symptom I want other parents to know about is the swelling. Newborns usually experience a drop in weight before gaining again so you should always question rapid weight gain. Lucca gained gin his first week and was hard to wake. Laura said: It’s not the midwe’s fault that these symptoms of CHD weren’t red flags, but I think community nursing teams need more training. As Lucca was my first, I had nothing to compare his progress too so I simply didn’t know these things weren’t normal.  The Tiny Tickers charity has launched their Think HEART campaign, helping parents to recognise the key signs that their baby may have an undiagnosed heart defect.They’re also working to improve the early detection and care of babies with CHD by training the sonographers who carry out pregnancy scans to be better able to detect heart defects, placing potentially le-saving equipment in maternity units and spreading awareness of the signs and symptoms of CHD.For more information, visithttps:www.tinytickers.org .

It was  years since he had last ridden a skateboard – he’d given it up to concentrate on his job as a welder and being a dad to his first child, Jack. But passing a skateboard shop in his hometown of Nottingham, he’d felt the pull of his old hobby. Minutes later, he walked out with a brand new board under his arm. STARTING SLOWLY That was two years ago, and Marc, now , has been brushing up on his skills. “It took me a while to get back into it, but I gradually got there,” he says. “I live opposite a skate park so I could see when it was quiet and I’d time my visits for then. Marc wasn’t sure how his body would stand up to the thrills – and inevitable spills – of the sport: “I started slowly so I didn’t hurt myself, and didn’t attempt anything more complicated than just moving round on the board at first. “I wasn’t too worried about what people thought, though. One of the good things about being older is that you care less about what people think.” As he grew more confident, Marc began to share his hobby with his family.  His -year-old son, Brandon, also had a skateboard, so the pair headed to a Skate Nottingham event, where the coaches taught them tricks and techniques. “Brandon will try stunts that I’m just too cautious to do,” says Marc. “I used to skate ramps, jumping from one and landing on another but it’s too dangerous now. I might crack my head or injure my knee and I’m too old for that. My worst injury has been a rolled ankle.” Marc sticks to street-style skating, where he uses kerbs and rails to skate on. “I taught myself to skate on rails by starting on low walls and then building up,” he explains. “It can take me anything from a week to nearly a year to learn a new trick. It feels great when I can master one that I’ve been working on for ages.” While Marc can skate some impressive rails, he’s still trying to master a basic kick flip, which involves jumping up, flipping the board over and landing on it. Skate Nottingham puts on National Lottery-funded events at skate parks, workshop venues and public spaces around the city, encouraging people of all ages to give it a go. It’s just one of many good causes to have benefited from National Lottery funding, thanks to the £ million raised every week* by players. For Marc it has become a family affair as his stepson, Bill, , joined in and the trio began to explore Nottingham’s skate parks. “We decided to visit as many as possible,” says Marc. “There are such a lot of them now and they’re all really well designed. We started before lockdown but have begun to explore dferent skate parks again now that things are beginning to open up again. And thanks to the support of The National Lottery, many of these parks have the funds to be maintained and improved. Marc started to go to more Skate Nottingham events to show others that you could skateboard regardless of your age. He also began to make friends as he saw the same faces at dferent events. “I didn’t have lots of confidence and I thought I was quite shut off from other people,” says Marc. “But it’s such an inclusive pastime that I began to really feel part of the community.” Meanwhile Marc and the boys began to record the skate parks they visited, and they have ventured further afield. At the last count they had visited around  parks, going as far as Cornwall. “We’re hoping to hit the  mark but we won’t stop there,” says Marc. “It’s become a real family affair too. My elder son, Jack, has started coming along for the ride and to explore new areas, and my -year-old stepdaughter Esme wants to get some roller skates.”  FURTHER BENEFITS As well as bringing them closer as a family, there have been some other benefits too. “It really helped with my mental health over lockdown,” says Marc. “It gave me the space to take some time for myself and unwind. And it’s helped me get to know Bill better. “I’ve also noticed that Brandon is really changing the way he approaches learning new things. In the skate park, he has to stop and assess things logically and I can see that having a positive effect at school too.” How the money you raise is raising smiles In these challenging times it’s great to be able to put a smile on people’s faces. And when you play The National Lottery you’re helping people to do exactly that – whether it’s by bringing the world of the Vikings to le or driving the unique underground train in London’s Postal Museum.  Many of those who have benefited from funding have faced their own le challenges. They include Ekow Otoo, who hasn’t let multiple sclerosis stop him achieving sporting glory. He now stars in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV ad, in which he pulls off some spectacular moves in his wheelchair at a skate park. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £ million for good causes every week* – and during the pandemic, aside from the Government, no one has made a greater contribution to those affected than National Lottery players.When we all play a little, fun stuff happens.

Four years ago, Harry told the BBC: One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is tell your children that your other parent has died.  How you deal with that, I donapost know. But he was there for us. He was the one out of two left. And he tried to do his best and to make sure that we were protected and looked after.But he was going through the same grieving process as well. However, this month In a series of TV interviews with Oprah Winfrey titled aposThe Me You Canapost Seeapos, Prince Harry accused the royal family of total neglect while he was being hounded by the media. He singled out his father Charles, the heir to the throne, claiming he allowed the boys to suffer when they were growing up. Harry also used the Apple TV+ series to say that he would never be bullied into silence again. Prince Charles is said to be hurt and disappointed, as well as boiling with anger over the remarks, according to a royal expert.  Nick Bullen, editor in chief of True Royal TV, said Prince Charles is “hurt” and “disappointed” by his youngest son’s comments, but is holding back from responding publicly. He told US Weekly: “It appears nothing is off limits now, he said. “It’s sad that their private family affairs are being aired in public yet again.” Since moving to the US last year, Harry and we Meghan Markle have sent shockwaves through the monarchy with their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. The couple accused members of the royal family of racism and Meghan shared how she considered suicide while the couple were working royals.

Julia Samuel borrowed the sweet idea from her pal Princess Diana and had a special surprise in store for Georgeaposs seventh birthday in July . Ms Samuel, , was a long-time friend of Diana and is godmother to both Prince William and George. She described how she buys aposimpossibleapos toys for the family that William then spends days attempting to put together with cautious assembling. Ms Samuel said: “I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making. “William then has to spend days putting together. And then put all the machinery together, and it makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that.” Seeing William putting the toys together with dficulty is an endless source of amusement for the family - especially for cheeky George. Watching William struggle to assemble the toys “makes me laugh, and it makes George laugh”, she added.Ms Samuel made the comments as she appeared on the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day. Ms Samuel added that George is amazing — Heaposs funny and feisty and cheeky and God she [Diana] would have loved him so much, she said. That is heartbreaking for all of them. The podcast was released on July  , on what would have been Princess Dianaaposs th birthday. Ms Samuel also said her favorite memory of the royal was her laugh. Therapist Ms Samuel was forced to apologise on TV last year as she promoted a new book on ITVaposs Lorraine.She turned the air blue and said a rude word while speaking about how people can cope while having a bad day. Ms Samuel said: You would go to your friend, “I’m having a s***e week,” I’m not sleeping, Iaposm furious with so and so I did a terrible show, something, something, somethingapos.  And then by the time you’ve had a cup of coffee and you’ve had a hug and you’ve roared with laughter maybe you’ve watched something funny on telly, it lessens. Whereasyou keep that in your system it kind go grows and gets bigger. She was force to apologise at the end of the interview, but admitted that most viewers probably didnapost even notice what was said. Lorraine explained: I’ve got to say sorry for a wee tiny bad word but I’m sure you didn’t notice.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince GeorgePrince WilliamPrincess DianaRoyal FamilyToys"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry rewriting history claiming","story":"NewsPrince Harry rewriting history by claiming Meghan suggested therapy, says expertThe Duke of Sussex recently claimed it was his we who encouraged him to seek therapy to help with his mental health - while one royal commentator says it was another key royal who urged him to get helpmirrorShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video prince-harry-appears-gma-talk-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:eefcddfbac,sourceUrl:https:twitter GMA status ,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:WuQjRI,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The Duke of Sussex recently appeared on podcast Armchair Expert in the US and claimed it was his we who encouraged him to seek therapy to help with his mental health. However, Daniela Elser said the couple must be suffering from amnesia - suggesting it was in fact Harryaposs brother William who initially suggested therapy. A strange pattern has emerged in what Meghan and Harry say. Either they’ve got amnesia or they’re trying to rewrite what happened, Elser told news.au. Before Harry and Meghan quit the firm for a lucrative le in the US, he told journalist Bryony Gordon that he had been “very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions”.  Speaking in , months after he started going out with the former Suits actress, he said his older brother William had tried to persuade him to seek help, reports Daily Star.His revelations emerged around the time royal biographer Angela Levin, who spent a year with the former army captain for her book Harry: Conversations With The Prince , also interviewed him about his decision to seek help. She wrote that she “asked him, ‘Are you going because Meghan suggested it, has she persuaded you,’ and he said, ‘Absolutely not, she had nothing to do with it, it was William.’” Four years later, Harry this month told US podcast host Dax Shepard: It was a conversation I had with my now-we. “She saw it straight away. She could tell that I was hurting and that some of the stuff that was out of my control was making me really angry and would make my blood boil.” Referencing Harryaposs other claims of not being able to ride on a bike with his father Prince Charles, Ms Elser wrote: This is not the only instance certain facts seem to have somehow gotten lost somewhere in the mix.  For some reason, members of the house of Windsor suffer from a particular form of amnesia when it comes to bikes. Speaking in , months after he started going out with the former Suits actress, he said his older brother William had tried to persuade him to seek help. It comes after a TV host claimed Prince Harry appeared to make a slip of the tongue when he claimed Meghan Markle pushed him to have therapy. In the coupleaposs much-publicised TV interview with Oprah back in March, Meghan herself claimed she was refused help. Commenting on the contradiction between the two statements, Australian host Andrew Bolt speaking on Sky News Australia said it was odd Harry could seek help, but Meghan could not. He asked: Didnapost she say in her notorious interview with Oprah Winfrey that when she wanted to go see a therapist herself Buckingham Palace refused her permission  Prince Harry, the actual prince could get therapy but his we could not FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDax ShepardPrince HarryRoyal FamilyMental healthTherapy"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry sends seismic tremors","story":"NewsPrince Harry sent ‘seismic tremors’ through Royal Family but ‘many have a dferent view’Harrys latest Oprah Winfrey interview has left the palace reeling – and a royal insider speaks of disagreement with the Princes portrayal of his familymirrorShareCommentsByLaurie Churchman:,  MAY NewsThe Queen and Prince Charles have reportedly been left gobsmacked by Harrys words\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But once source claims many people have a dferent view of Harryaposs upbringing.During the documentary Harry he took up therapy four years ago – and explained he is finally free to talk about his innermost feelings.  The Queen and Prince Charles have reportedly been left gobsmacked amid claims Buckingham Palace has been blindsided by Harryaposs revelations.Prince Harry allegedly pitched a very dferent programme to the Queen when she signed off on it three years ago, believing it would be a documentary about mental health among military veterans. An insider told MailOnline: No one within the Palace circles has anything but sympathy for Harryaposs trauma and troubled le, but there is upset and discomfort at him sharing it on an international television show. Certainly the intimate detail of his hardships paint a very negative picture of his family and upbringing. Many people have a dferent view. The source said: It has sent seismic tremors out everywhere. Harry has the freedom to speak up for his truth, sure. But there has always been an understanding of accountability. Harry appears to have ruffled feathers in the royal family by speaking publicly – but he says the Firm has failed to listen to him in the past.  In the first episode of the docuseries, Harry says that he and Meghan - along with son Archie - spent four years trying to make it work but their requests for help when Meghan was suicidal were met with total silence, total neglect. We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job, he stated. But Meghan was struggling. That feeling of being trapped within the family, there was no option to leave, he added.  Eventually when I made that decision for my family, I was still told, aposYou canapost do thisapos. And itaposs like, aposWell how bad does it have to get until I am allowed to do this apos She [Meghan] was going to end her le. It shouldnapost have to get to that. This is the latest in the family feud after the coupleaposs shocking interview with Oprah Winfrey in March. Meghan spoke of the intense pressures of being in the Royal Family, and said she was left feeling suicidal.  The Duchess of Sussex also alleged racist comments were made to Harry about the potential skin colour of their then-unborn child Archie, and the couple said a Royal Family member had expressed concerns over how dark their sonaposs skin might be. In the interview Harry also spoke of his troubled relationship with his father, saying Prince Charles had stopped taking his calls after the coupleaposs shock break from the Royal Family. Prince Charles is said to be boiling with anger after his son Harryaposs latest attacks over his treatment by the royals, according to an expert. Nick Bullen, editor in chief of True Royal TV, said Prince Charles is “hurt” and “disappointed” by his youngest son’s comments, but is holding back from responding publicly. He told US Weekly: “It appears nothing is off limits now, he said. “It’s sad that their private family affairs are being aired in public yet again.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarkleThe QueenPrince HarryOprah WinfreyPrince Charles, Prince of WalesDocumentariesRoyal FamilyMental healthTherapy"},{"url":null,"title":"tiny beach hut you cant","story":"NewsTiny beach hut where you cant sleep on sale for same price as a small houseA hut in one of the most popular holiday resorts in Dorset is going for £, and while it is complete with electricity, a cooker and seating, overnight stays are bannedmirrorShareCommentsByNancy Connolly:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThis beach hut in Somerset is being sold for the same price of a small house \" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The cute little hut is right on the beach in one of the most sought-after locations near Somerset and is currently on sale for £, - the same price as a house in other parts of the country. Located on the beach at Lyme Regis, one of the most popular holiday resorts on the Dorset coast, it is ft x ft and is complete with electricity, a cooker, light, seating, storage and a ladder.The shed has all it needs for one to comfortably spend the whole day in it, but there is one rule of thumb that mustnapost be broken - you cannot stay overnight, SomersetLive reports.Do you think the hut is worth its selling price  Let us know in the comments section below. Itaposs also the only hut for sale in the area. Selling agents Fortnam, Smith and Banwell describe the property on Rightmove as a rare opportunity to own a beach hut on the popular Monmouth beach in Lyme Regis. This ten foot by eight foot day hut has been very well maintained by previous owners with excellent fold down decking and superb sea views. The new owner will also have to pay the local council nearly £ a year for ground rent with the hut also available to rent out for around £ a day. Many of the beach huts in Lyme Regis are personalised.

BBC Weather is forecasting the highs from next Thursday in London and the South, with temperatures well over C across the UK, and plenty more sunshine in store.

Some parts of the UK will be as hot as balmy Ibiza, as forecasters predict temperatures will soar into the mid-s this weekend to highs of about  C.Do you have Bank Holiday sunshine plans  Share your thoughts in the comments below... It will be a welcome hot spell after one of the wettest Mays on record. The rain persisted as the latest lockdown easing allowed socialising to finally move indoors - following weeks of revellers packing raincoats and umbrellas for gatherings in soggy parks and beer gardens. But London and other parts of England could be bathed in highs of C over the Bank Holiday weekend, Met Office forecasts say. Temperatures are then expected to cool slightly on Bank Holiday Monday, according to its latest nine-day forecast. Soaring temperatures and clear blue skies are forecast for some parts of the UK on Sunday, in a welcome contrast to the chilly early May Bank Holiday long weekend just weeks ago. Meanwhile, temperatures of C are predicted for Englandaposs South East, North West and Wales.  Temperatures in London and the south of the UK are expected to linger above C for at least the next two weeks, according to long-range weather forecasts, hitting even warmer highs next week. There may be slightly cooler temperatures in the north, according to the long range predictions. Met Office meterologist Oli Claydon told the Mail Online : Showers will start to ease and temperatures will increase over the bank holiday. Thereaposll be highs of up to Ffor central parts of England and possibly into London. There is a slow progression towards warmer and drier conditions. The Met Office said that up to last Saturday the UK had recorded an average of .mm of rainfall –  percent of the historic average for the month.. This monthaposs rainfall made it the th wettest May on record, according to the forecasteraposs figures.  The national forecasteraposs long-range forecast to June  predicts warm, settled conditions across many areas beginning early next week. Forecasters warn there is the potential for outbreaks of rain to arrive across parts of the UKaposs north west on Monday. There could be unsettled conditions next week, but it was too soon to say how far south and east the showers may spread, according to the Met Office.  Its experts are predicting a good deal of dry weather across the board. But some heavy showers could be in store, and are most likely to hit the south and west during the end of next week, the Met Office cautions. Despite the potential for a drenching, temperatures will most likely remain around or above average. Closer to June , it is likely to become more unsettled and cooler in the North West, but drier and warmer in the South East.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHeatwaveWeatherHolidays"},{"url":null,"title":"urban explorers share rare footage","story":"NewsInside Jeffrey Epsteins paedophile island as explorers sneak into secret hideawayThe pair claimed to have made it to Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands - bought by Epstein  years ago and which became known as paedophile island or orgy islandmirrorShareByAbigail OLearyReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video jeffrey-epstein-explorers-sneak-onto-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:cJjdzxL,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The pair claimed to have made it to Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands - bought by Epstein  years ago and which became known as apospaedophile islandapos or aposorgy islandapos. Epstein carried out many of his sick crimes against underage girls at the tropical resort. The island has been abandoned since Epsteinaposs death in . But urban explorer Andy Bracco - otherwise known as Place Hacker - and friend Jon Megna, decided to secretly scramble ashore and roam around last year, reports Lad Bible.

The island is also home to a stone mansion, with cream walls and a bright turquoise roof surrounded by maidsapos quarters was built first, followed by the temple topped with a gold dome. Speculation about the building, resembling a religious temple, has questionedit was used for the child sex abuse Epstein was accused of. A medieval-style lock on the front became a curious point of conversation for those working there, who suggested it could have been used to lock people inside with no escape. The front is flanked by statues painted in gold one which appears to be Poseidon, Greek god of the sea, and another that looks like a pair of birds.  It is surrounded by palm trees and a terrace with a labyrinth mot. A small structure downhill from the building has led some to believe it serves as a second entrance and suggest that the space extends into an underground lair.  Chicago-based contractor James Both shared his professional thoughts on the buildingaposs door with Business Insider.Itaposs styled like what you might see on a castle, with what appears to be a reinforcing lock bar across the face, he said.

The man, who has remained anonymous, said that he and his we met a couple around nine years ago and since then they have become firm friends. So it came as no great shock when the man was asked to be godfather to the coupleaposs expected child, and the man was thrilled to accept. But then he was stunned when an envelope was delivered containing a legally binding contract and a long list of demands - including that the man become Catholic and gt the child nearly £,. Sharing his story on Reddit, the man said that his we and his friendaposs we are from the same country, the Philippines, and that the man doesnapost have any family left of his own.As such, they had no one  they could ask to be the godfather to their child, who the man called aposJaneapos for the sake of the post. He wrote: The husband asked meI could be Janeaposs godfather. To note they are Catholic. I was honoured. My friend was thrilled and the next day he dropped off an envelope with some papers in it. After he left I looked and it was a legal contract that I needed to sign in order to be the godfather. Obviously I thought it was a bit overboard but gave it a read anyways. It has many things I MUST do as a godfather. Such as I must go to every catholic event in which Jane attends such as christening, confession, confirmation, etc.  Which I know are normal events for a Catholic childaposs le. Not a big deal. Then we get into ridiculous things - I have to consider aposbecoming Catholicapos, I must give a gt of at least for each of these events, and on birthdays Christmas, gts must be cash only and over  . Oh no, it gets worse. I am expected to save at least , and set it aside for Janeaposs future college tuition. Her parents will provide the rest. Seriously !  The list goes on to include ious things such as being willing to cancel any plans I havethey need me to watch Jane orthey go on vacation . Many of the other things on the list were silly or not a big deal .  The man said how he then called his friend and explained that he couldnapost sign the contract as it was too demanding, and the friend soon became angry. He continued: He essentially told me he thought I was a aposgood guyapos but it was apparent I was selfish. He has since blocked my number and my email. His we has too. Since he ended things, I shredded the papers he gave me and left them in a bag and put it in his mailbox for him, telling him it was a shame he ruined a friendship over ridiculous demands. I told him I forgive him regardless. After sharing the post online, Reddit users were quick to defend the manaposs actions - adding that he wasnapost in the wrong for refusing. One said: Haha! Wait youaposre serious  AHAHAHA! Sounds like they think youaposre a sucker and want to use you as a free ATM machine. They want you to pony up at least  thousand dollars for future college fund  No no, they want you to just pay for their kid while they can spend their own money on whatever they want. Another posted: Putting , away for a childaposs college tuition that isnapost even yours is a HUGE ask. Iaposve never heard of a godparent giving so much money at every event and they really shouldnapost be surprised that you didnapost go through with it. Most people wouldnapost be able to handle that financial burden and theyaposre going to learn that the hard way. Iaposm sorry that this situation ruined your friendship and hopefully theyaposll see just how much of a selfish a*****e theyaposre being While another added: You didnapost refuse to become Janeaposs godfather - you refused to sign a crazy and completely unacceptable aposcontractapos.

Chloe Lythgoe received an alert on her phone that a delivery was arriving, when she said she saw the driver walking up the path and smiling to himself. As she signed for the package, she realised the name of the X-rated sex toy inside was printed on the label - right next to the barcode the postal worker had to scan first. I opened the door and he handed it over, smirking ashe knew what was in the box, she sad.  It was awful, I looked at him asto say aposplease, I hope youaposve not seen itapos and he looked back to say aposI know whataposs in thereapos. The -year-old ordered the £ adult toy from Amazon, with the product delivery details promising to make discretion aposa primary considerationapos. But Chloe, from Warrington, says she now feels aposmortiedapos every time she has to answer the door to face her postie. I went bright red, just closed the door and thought apostypical meapos, she said. I just wanted the ground to open up and eat me, it was less than discreet.  I opened the door in my dressing gown too with my kids stood behind me wondering who was at the door with my hair up in a aposmum bunapos - I bet I looked the part. I felt so embarrassed. Even now when he comes to the door I can’t look at him in the eye, just knowing he knows what I get up to makes me cringe. He still delivers all my parcels and every time I open the door I think aposoh why  Please changeapos. Iaposve got years of embarrassment to come.  The full-time mum-of-three ordered the product after it was recommended by friends, deciding to go for it and try something new. Chloe said her pals felt her embarrassment when she told them the story and added: On the page it said it was discreet and I thought that was fine.When I told my friends, surprisingly they asked me how it was, so the company has sold quite a few [off the back of] my [Facebook] story, I believe.An Amazon spokesperson said: Amazon is investigating the issue.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSex toysViral"},{"url":null,"title":"woman left stitches cats unenthusiastic","story":"NewsWoman left in stitches at her cats unenthusiastic response to his new toyThe moggie barely had the energy to raise a paw as his devoted owner Casey tried to entertain him with a new toy, and she admitted he actually preferred the box the gt came inmirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video woman-left-stitches-cats-unenthusiastic-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:CScGMn,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The female tortoise thought to be more than  years old and is currently being kept in a breeding centre on the Santa Cruz island. Galapagos National Park is now preparing an expedition to seemore of the species can be found and prevent them from going into extinction.  The national park, along with Galapagos Conservancy, the ones to find the tortoise from a species identied by Yale University as the Chelonoidis phantasticus.

Samples from the female animal were reportedly compared with the remains of a male before it could be confirmed they were indeed from the same family.  In the Galapagos Islands, which served as the basis for the British scientist Charles Darwinaposs theory of the evolution of species in the th century, many ieties of tortoises live together with flamingos, boobies, albatrosses and cormorants, a family of species of aquatic birds. It also houses a large amount of flora and fauna in danger of extinction.It was believed extinct more than  years ago!

One was known as “Lonesome George”, a male Pinta Island tortoise, the last known of the species, who died in  without leaving any offspring. Scientists believe that tortoises first arrived in the Galapagos two to three million years ago after drting  miles from the South American coast on vegetation rafts or of their own accord.

Celtic Park, Pittodrie, Easter Road and, ahem, the Tony Macaroni await the Dark Blues next season.Not to mention Tannadice.And, hopefully, fans will be making those journeys to see their club playing Premiership football once more.It’s been a long, long time since Dundee started moving up in the world.Since finishing sixth in  , it’s been eighth, tenth, ninth, th and then a pandemic-stopped-play third in the Championship.Pretty steady decline over a six-year period.Now, though, that’s all forgotten about.Dundee are back in the top flight and mean business.Every player in the squad has been fantastic in their run to promotion, no doubt about that.It’s taken a huge team effort.And you could see from the celebrations how much the players have enjoyed playing together – eventhere is the occasional barney on the pitch when someone shoots from  yards.Not mentioning any names here, of course.Or any of the choice words used. . .The players all deserve immense credit, as does everyone at the club.And two men deserving of even more credit are manager James McPake and managing director John Nelms.It would be fair to say neither have been universally loved over the past couple of years.McPake has had plenty of critics during his time in charge.He’s had to learn how to be a manager pretty much on the job and, at times, made mistakes.Mistakes he admits to and even says it’s those errors that have shaped him.Now, though, he’s shown he can lead a team to promotion, build a very good team and get them playing.From where they have been at times this season, it’s a remarkable turnaround.The biggest part of that was sorting out a leaky backline and turning them into a solid defensive outfit.Kilmarnock barely got a snf throughout  minutes of football despite their qualities up front. | Dundee Promotion Joy As Kilmarnock are Relegated | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed A_hgapJNaw start#featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenI’m delighted for the manager, too, on a personal note.Very honest – sometimes maybe too much for his own good – McPake is also good value to speak to and chat about football, in press conferences and in general.It’s great to see one of the good guys get rewarded with success for their hard work.Also deserving of praise is Nelms.I’ve been critical of his managerial appointments in the past but his choice this time has paid off – and so has his patience.I’ve written before in columns that other boards would have made a change in the dugout in the same situation Dundee are in.For me,you appoint an inexperienced manager you have to expect things to go wrong at times and be prepared to be patient.Nelms showed that, stuck by his man and has been repaid in spades.Now he has a confident young manager in charge of a confident young team – things are finally looking up at Dens Park.It’s always a shame when a manager leaves a football club.Unless they are moving on to bigger things, it usually means things aren’t quite right at a club.That’s the feeling I get with the departure of Micky Mellon from Dundee United.He did the job put in front of him but for weeks now, story after story has suggested change was coming at Tannadice.From the outside it looks to me like it might have been the best for both sides to move in dferent directions.Though I’m sure it will all come out at some point what has led to the parting of ways.And it is good they sorted it out nice and early, the last thing the club needed was a drawn-out process eating into summer preparations.It means yet another change in a critical position, though.United have to get the next one right.As an ambitious club, they need a long-term option because they can’t go swapping out a manager every season.Tam Courts is the name on everyone’s lips at the moment to come in.I can’t imagine the fans will be overly pleased to see a manager with so little experience at this level given the job.However, it very much seems to me they want a young, modern coach at the helm.After one season in the Premiership, United are at a key moment – whoever they choose, they need to get the right man in.What an incredible week on Tayside – Dundee go up, United get rid of a manager and St Johnstone win the Scottish Cup.It’s a quite ridiculous achievement for a club that size to win two major trophies in one season.So many people have said it but it doesn’t make it any less amazing.I’m delighted for them – and their players who enjoyed loan spells at my club a few years back – but I have a big worry.Our game will only sufferit’s the same old teams winning everything – come on Saints, let someone  win for once. . .LEE WILKIE:

We want to be in the top six.mdash SPFLMay , “I talk to Steve Brown quite often and, watching him after the match at the weekend, he was in tears. That’s how much that meant to him.“To do the double is almost like Leicester winning the league and things like this can happenyou get on a right run and get the right guy.”While he did not replicate Brown’s tears as he undertook rare media duties, it was evident just how important promotion was to Nelms following a two-year exile from the Premiership.And he has no intention of ever going through that again.“This year has been very dficult to navigate as we had no idea what was happening,” Nelms added candidly. “Being in the Championship really laser focuses your attention — as did being in the middle of a pandemic.“Everything we did was a proper graft and I couldn#t be more pleased with the manager and his staff.“We never want to be back in the Championship again. It is a hard slog to get out of this league and we don#t want to be there.“We are always trying to learn to make sure we don#t make those mistakes again. We will try to do things a dferent way and the right way.”mdash SPFLMay , However, Nelms is adamant that does not mean ‘starving’ McPake of funds as the Dundee gaffer seeks to build a top-flight squad.“We will have a look at [strengthening] but we have never starved our manager of finances,” he added. “Within reason, we will do what we have to and try to build a proper, sound, stable team.”Dundee star Jason Cummings in Instagram nod to classic Only Fools and Horses scene after chandelier celebration\" title\"#Dundee star Jason Cummings in Instagram nod to classic Only Fools and Horses scene after chandelier celebration# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-star-jason-cummings-in-instagram-nod-to-classic-only-fools-and-horses-scene-after-chandelier-celebration embed # secrethmOPKNd\" data-secret\"hmOPKNd\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

favourite cookie from the shelves during lockdown, Amanda Charles got to work in building her own baking empire.We#ve all had those moments when we search the shelves for our favourite items and realise they have disappeared.While most of us just accept this fate, -year-old Amanda Charles from Aberdeen wasn#t going to commit to a lockdown without Sainsbury#s white chocolate and raspberry cookie.Instead, she got to work in her kitchen in her third storey flat and worked on making her own.Inspired by New York City-based baking firm Levian Bakery to make huge, chunky cookies, Amanda now bakes more than  cookies a week from her new commercial kitchen premises in the city centre.Having been made redundant from her role in oil and gas recruitment, she knew there were no jobs and decided to make a go of her idea and launched Cookie Cult in December last year.She said: #I launched the business mid-December . During the pandemic I had been on furlough at one point for around five months, then they brought us back until the end of October last year and then I was made redundant.#I worked for a recruitment agency for oil and gas and I didn#t know what I was going to do. Having worked for a recruitment agency I knew there were no jobs.#When I was on furlough I was trying to perfect cookies # Sainsbury#s make this delicious white chocolate and raspberry cookie, and when coronavirus happened, they stopped selling it. I wanted to try and make it and then I just started making cookies all the time.#I was handing them out to friends and then they were asking to purchase cookies for their friends, and then random people started messaging me about it. When I was made redundant I just thought to myself #let#s make some cookies!#.Specialising in New York inspired thick, chunky cookies, Amanda has not only brought a new must-try product to the Aberdeen market, but has launched a range of dferent flavours has added vegan products to her offering, too.She added: #It has taken off so much. I was looking on Instagram for inspiration and it was Levain Bakery whose cookies I had seen # that#s where I was inspired by the idea for big, chunky cookies. I attempted to try to make them and it has just adapted from that.#I#ve changed the recipe now to make them even chunkier! I#ve focused on my favourite flavours and now people message me flavours they#d like to see, too.#I#ve taken real inspiration from my customers. I#ve just launched five new seasonal ones for summer including s#mores, cookies and cream, Kinder, strawberries and cream and a vegan version of Biscoff.#There#s seven in the core Cult Classics range and then I#ll have seasonal specials, too, which means I can experiment more with flavours. I have done Easter and Christmas ones, and I#m doing Father#s Day ones, too.#The Nutella and Biscoff flavours are the most popular, and birthday cake is big. Some are more popular than others some weeks.#My boyfriend#s family are all vegan and I thought #I can#t make cookies and not be able to give them to them#. They are more popular than I ever thought they would be.#Launching in her flat, the back-breaking task of hauling huge bags of flour up three flights of stairs is now no more for the entrepreneur as she has now moved into her first commercial kitchen.Situated on Charles Street, the premises originally belonged to Amanda#s dad who runs his car garage next door, but is now the home of Cookie Cult.Amanda said: #I live in a top floor flat and I used to have to hike these huge bags of flour up three floors of stairs every single day. It was a lot!##My home kitchen is half of the size of my new commercial one now. My fridge and freezer space wasn#t enough. I knew I had to do something but with Covid- I wasn#t sureI wanted to take the risk and rent somewhere.#Luckily my dad owns a garageand they had a spare room to the side of the building they weren#t using so we have turned it into a commercial kitchen.#I could fit  cookies in my home oven which is nothing when you#re making hundreds of cookies a day. I was up to am some days as I#d be making up to  cookies in a flat. I can now bake  at a time # my le has changed! They are between  grams and  grams # they are big, so they take up a lot of room.So what is Amanda#s secret to making the chunkiest cookies in Aberdeen  Freezing them, baking them, and packing them full of goodies.She added: #You have to freeze them to get their chunkiness and they need minimum two hours, then they need baked # I only had a certain amount of room so I was making them non-stop. The new set-up is much better.##I make  a week standard now, but for Valentine#s Day I made more than , in one week.#Looking to expand the business in her new digs, Amanda already supplies two cafes with her goods and is on the hunt for more commercial opportunities.Her boxes online are priced from £ for a box of four, with each cookie priced at £ a piece. Boxes come with four, six, or  cookies.#I#m in Blether in Cults and I#m now in Orka Artisan Cafe in Aberdeen as so many people got in touch with her to ask them to stock my products,# said Amanda.#Now I have a commercial kitchen I have plans to go into other venues which is really exciting. I#d love to get into a cafe in Bridge of Don as I have so many deliveries out there and I think that would be great.#I  have teamed up with a local company called DF Distributions who are amazing. They deliver local school meals for people and my driver, Dana, is excellent. They collect from my premises Wednesday to Friday and deliver across the city. I ship UK-wide and I am actually busier with shipped orders. I am thinking of offering collection soon, too.#With her hopes set on one day owning her own shop and employing a team, customers can expect to see more from Amanda as she progresses her business.She said: #I hope one day I will get a shop. I need to observe what is happening with the pandemic, but I#d love one in the city centre.#I#d also like to employ some staff, too.

This number has now dropped to , the lowest rate since before Christmas.Deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian, Chris Littlejohn, reminded the public that no one can afford to become complacent in the face of this virus.He said: “We need to remember this is still an infectious virus, with more transmissible iants being passed around in some parts of the country. We saw with this outbreak in Moray, how quickly things can escalate and how quickly it can affect the level system.“Ultimately people need to take responsibility for their own actions. For instance,another area of Scotland has particularly high rates of the virus or it is known a iant of concern is widely in circulation, is it worth the risk of travelling there and importing it back to Moray and the north-east #To each inidual in the north-east, I’d ask you please follow the guidelines above that use your own judgement, especially when travelling protect each other and protect Grampian.”Mr Littlejohn also reminded the people of Moray that current guidance is still for people to be working from home where possible, even once we reach level .Moray MSP Richard Lochhead also urged people to stick to public health guidance: #Moray’s outbreak was a stark reminder that covid hasn’t gone away and the our communities are not immune from the spread of this virus, so I would encourage people to remain vigilant and to continue to stick to public health guidance to keep Moray safe going forward.#Moray has been praised for its response to rising cases at the beginning of the month. Mr Lochhead said: #I want to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone involved in responding to the surge in covid cases in Moray over the last few weeks. The efforts of healthcare staff, community volunteers, and public health officials to drive case numbers down has been nothing short of phenomenal and I know our communities are incredibly grateful.#Those coming forward for tests has increased six-fold in the region, % of - years olds have now had their first dose of the vaccine, along with .% of those aged - and .% of those aged -. Mr Littlejohn said: #The drop in case rates is an incredibly positive story. We’ve not seen a decline like this without a full lockdown before, we’ve only seen this kind of turnaround with a full lockdown. How the public responded and acted was the reason that happened.#I’d like to thank the public, without their efforts Moray would most likely still be in level three the testing and vaccinations teams for their tireless work Moray Council and other organisations including VisitMoray Speyside, who worked with us.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

This provided learners with the opportunity to see new words and phrases and gave fluent speakers the chance to use Gaelic outside the classroom.It was the young learners who really caught the judge’s attention though, with their production, Èirich.Èirich tells the story of a social media trend that transports people into a dangerous new world, with some students caught in an infinite loop and others caught by the ‘person in the shadows’.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Councillor Robin Currie said: #These talented filmmakers from Islay High School have created two exceptional productions and I’m very, very proud of them.#Gaelic has played an important role in the history of Argyll and Bute for many years and we’re committed to continuing to promote the language and its culture to our communities.#A marine geologist who was instrumental in creating the marine science degree at the Scottish Association for Marine ScienceUHI  years ago has been awarded a professorship from the University of the Highlands and Islands.Professor John Howe was one of four scientists who established the BSc marine science programme.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These things come with conflicting pressures on managers’ time, which is why we offer the opportunity to be part of a working group.#The performance in getting responses to surveys is something we want to improve. We have had communications about how to pick it up.#Councillor Findlay, one of three members for the Isle of Bute ward, then asked: #Should it be compulsory for managers to complete the survey #It is vital that managers lead and lead well, so I am quite disappointed by the response.#Ms Fowler replied: #We try to avoid compulsion because we are trying to work collaboratively with our colleagues. We look to get as wide a representation as we can.#Feedback to the nature of the policy itself was more positive, with SNP Helensburgh and Lomond South councillor Richard Trail saying: #I welcome this change of emphasis, changing the policy from talking about absence to supporting attendance.#This, we hope, will improve attendance, but how will we measure that in the months and years ahead  Have you any kind of measures you will be able to bring to us ##We have detailed information on what our absences have been like during Covid,# responded Ms Fowler. #We had a requirement to report on it on a weekly basis.#We will see levels of absence reported on scorecards so members can see what our rates of absence are.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

With Children.\"She [Rebel] is like me, in that Ive been a working mum my whole le,\" says the -year old, who is married to Kurt Sutter, her third husband and Sons of Anarchy co-star .\"I am a much better mumIm a working mum, and I would not know how to sacrice one of them - and shes the same.\"Shes got this huge drive and passion for what she does, she also has children and loves them, and it gets messy and somebody gets neglected.\"In the series you see the repercussions on her older kids, and theyll complain about her - that she didnt spend enough time with them and she didnt make it to school s and she didnt do all that.\"But, at the same time, the two older children go into service work: ones a doctor, ones a lawyer, and theyre fighting the good fight. So, you see how it [Rebels work] kind of rubbed off on them.\"Also starring John Corbett, Tamala Jones and Andy Garcia, the series follows the \"funny, fearless, brilliant\" Rebel, and her work as a blue-collar legal advocate without a law degree.When Rebel applies herself to a fight she believes in, she will win at almost any cost.It feels notably rare still to see \"messy\" women like this on screen, and Sagal loves playing someone whos flawed.\"She is not perfect, by any means, and you get to see a three-dimensional person thats trying to juggle everything,\" elaborates the actress.\"And she orders a lot of people around - shes not always polite. Shes just kind of in your face. She thinks shes right and you have to do what she says.\"Empowering lead characters aside, what was it about this script that stood out for Sagal \"I was very energised by the creator of the show, Krista [Vernoff]. And when I knew that it was inspired by Erin Brockovich - it wasnt her le, because we dont have her le rights - I was immediately interested in that because I love what she does.\"Another draw was that Sagal knew the team behind Rebel wanted her she was actually approached and asked to play the part, she reveals.And it sounds as though it was a no-brainer to say yes.\"I love that shes working for something,\" she follows. \"I like that it means something.\"As an entertainer, I look at the whole thing as helping people, really. And then to have subject matter that actually gives voice to helping people... I dont think people necessarily need to watch television because of that but for me, personally, to be able to be saying something is important to me. So, all of that attracted me to it.\"Also, shes very dferent to me. People think just because Ive played a lot of badass characters that I am that way, but Im really not. So, thats always fun for me to be in that position.\"As part of her preparation for the role, Sagal met Brockovich, who is now in her sixties, a couple of times.She recalls having lunch with her and Vernoff, and how they all \"just got on so well\".Being able to pick up on the activists vibe informed her work on the show, she explains, as the lunch quickly \"became like a sort of girls chat\".\"I understood who she was just sitting there with her. She talks very passionately and very quickly - and shes very smart and funny.\"There is a lovely warmth that radiates from Sagal, even though the interview is through a screen, over a Zoom call.As well as an impressively ied acting career, she is also known as a singer-songwriter she worked as a backing vocalist for the likes of Bob Dylan and Etta James, was a member of Bette Midlers backup group, The Harlettes, and she still performs on stage today.\"I love to play music,\" she enthuses. \"Now its so in the right place in my le because I dont rely on music, but I have my band. We go out and play and have fun.\"We end our chat discussing what Sagal has learned about herself from making Rebel, and she muses on how all roles allow an \"inner something to be released\".In the case of Rebel, \"she gets angry a lot in the name of something righteous\" - something the star has obviously enjoyed getting her teeth into, from the way she smiles playfully when talking about the emotionally-charged scenes.\"Its so great to be able to scream and yell at somebody,\" she admits. \"And she doesnt censor herself. As a human being, I think Im a little more diplomatic, Im a little more concerned with what other people think I struggle with a lot of that. She doesnt care what you think.\"She knows that shes in the right world, she knows what she believes in and shell just let it fly - and theres something very liberating about that.\"Rebel premieres exclusively on Disney+ on Friday"},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-safe-plant-tender-veg","story":"Gardening: When is it safe to plant out tender veg Tomatoes and chillies in a bowIts just about time to plant out tender veg safely - or is it The rise and fall of temperatures this spring - April started off warm and dry, but ended up being the frostiest April in  years - has left some gardeners in a quandary about when to plant out their tender edibles, including courgettes, tomatoes and chillies.Gardening expert, bestselling author and presenter, Alys Fowler, says that a handful of tender crops need to bake in warm conditions, and sulkthey are subjected to cold and wet.\"Chillies, tomatoes and aubergines should have already been sown, although you could get away with sowing courgettes and possibly sweetcorn in mid-May,\" says Fowler, whose new book Eat What You Grow offers a wealth of advice on growing fruit and veg.As a general rule, tender plants that have been sown indoors can be taken outside between mid-May and early June, depending on where you live, but only when all danger of frost has passed.Tender plants will need to be hardened off - acclimatised gradually and with protection, whether it be a cold frame, greenhouse, sheltered porch or under a cloche, she advises.Tomatoes\"To have good tomato growth you need night-time temperatures to remain above  degrees, and preferably -C. The cold spring doesnt mean they cant go outside, but they really do need to be protected.\"They need to be in a patio greenhouse, or something like that. You can use a cold frame but really the best tomatoes are grown in a greenhouse in this country.\"Growing them outside means you are growing them really late and you wont get tomatoes until September. They need heat and sun to ripen. Dont expect to be eating them in June.\"Some ieties are better for growing outside, such as Gardeners Delight, Kenilworth and Matts Wild Cherry.\"She says hardening off takes two or three weeks, and dont just turf them out on a really sunny day, as the change in conditions can cause the plants stress and they may wilt as they try to adjust.Top tip: \"The more room that you give your tomatoes, the better they will grow. Put them in the biggest pot you possibly can. The more root mass, the healthier the plant. And as soon as you see the flowers, start feeding the plant every week.\"Chillies\"Chillies are like tomatoes, they really need heat. They come from South America and want to bask in the heat. A good place to grow them is on your windowsill, butyou are growing them outside, it needs to be a really sheltered, sunny spot like a sunny courtyard or patio.\"They make a lovely houseplant, although some grow to ft, while others are really small such as Prairie Fire, which would work on a windowsill. The chillies start off yellow and ripen to bright red.\"She notes that chillies are hungry, so will need potting on a lot more regularly than tomatoes, in fact every time the roots stick out of the bottom of the drainage holes, youll need to pot them on. And once flowers appear, feed them weekly, she advises.Top tip: \"Some ieties produce a king chilli, which is the first fruit which appears on the first axis of the plant. Take it off, otherwise it will prevent further flowering by concentrating a lot of the growth into this single fruit.\"Courgettes\"Put them out too early and you may get lots of male flowers when its cold, which will mean flowers and no courgettes, which is frustrating. The only thing to do is wait for it to warm up.\"Courgettes are big plants and people tend to put them slightly too close together. They really are better .-ft apart.\"Top tip: \"Keep picking them when they are small and they will keep producing. If you let them grow into marrows they start to think that the end of their days are coming and they wont produce so many.\"Sweetcorn\"If you havent sown it already, you can still sow sweetcorn in May, preferably indoors in pots. The minute theyve got to a good size - thicker than a pencil - get them in the ground when all danger of frost has passed.\"They are wind-pollinated, so you need to plant them in a block so that you raise the chances of the pollen hitting a neighbour. Plant them between - inches apart ideally. They dont need staking but keep them out of a direct wind tunnel.\"Sweetcorn are easy to grow but they will need a fairly good summer to produce good cobs.\"Top tip: \"If you think theyre getting rocked about too much, you can draw up the soil around the base.\"Eat What You Grow by Alys Fowler is published by Kyle Books, priced pound.

CMAL. Well, good luck with that. Without any background in the subject, he will probably follow advice from those whose long-range genius created the problems in the first place.:Brian Wilson: SNP hammered hospitality but guaranteed George Square chaosThen we have the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and ndash very much a late tag-on ndash Islands, Mairi Gougeon, MSP for Angus South. The previous ldquoand Islands Minister was Paul Wheelhouse, from the Borders, who for some reason became Minister for Fergusonrsquos although, unlike Mr Dey, he was not a Transport Minister. So many Ministers, so little continuity, so much title-shuffling.The common characteristic is that none of them has constituency interests in either ferries or islands. The SNP have six MSPs in the Highlands and Islandsand none has ever been allowed near either role. This is consistent with nobody from the communities served by CMAL and CalMac being on the boards of either.I doubtthere is a coastal country in Europe, perhaps the world, where the same prohibition would be tolerated. Certainly not in the Scandinavian lands which are so often held up as role models ndash which set me thinking about the Faroes and why the idea of autonomy for the Scottish islands should be taken seriously.Ferries are only the current example. It is inconceivable that an islands-based ferry company could do a worse job. Indeed, the Western Isles Council has just put forward a very coherent plan, both short-term and medium-term, for escaping from the current mess. It should, I suggest, be Mr Deyrsquos preferred reading before he gets to the civil service brief.It would also create enough jobs to be transformational in island communities. For decades in the islands, ldquoGourock has been shorthand for mismanagement, nepotism and worse. It is an anachronism dating back to the  merger of MacBrayne with the Caledonian Steam Packet Companythat the whole show is run from there rather than some of the places it is supposed serve.The same reasoning can be applied to every distinctively island public service, run from afar. Crofting regulation is another easy example. The whole thing is a shambles regulated from a centralised bureaucracy in Inverness. It is impossible to believe it would not be more pro-active and alert to depressing realities on the groundit operated at localised levels.:Brian Wilson: Theres nothing green about iding Britain or closing down the North SeaNeither is the argument confined to the public sector. The first person I heard espouse the Faroes as a role model was the late Ian Noble who had gone there in the s and learned how economic development and cultural renaissance went hand in hand. He applied that principle in Skye, particularly as founder of Sabhal Mor Ostaig, Scotlandrsquos Gaelic college.The lesson has never been built on. Greater political and administrative autonomy would keep people in the islands ndash just as in Faroes where population has gone from , in  to almost , today. Natural entrepreneurism would flourish. How curious that one of the biggest fish farmers in our own islands was recently bought by a Faroese company. Could it ever happen the other way round The neo-colonialism exercised by Edinburgh should be replaced by serious decentralisation. No ldquosubsidy is required. The pretence Scotlandrsquos islands donrsquot pay their way is ridiculous. From Shetlandrsquos oil to Islayrsquos whisky, not to mention a disproportionate contribution to Scotlandrsquos global images and a host of world class products, the islands pay their dues many times over to UK and Scottish coffers.Anyone who actually believes in devolution would see the case for islandsrsquo autonomy ndash not as a threat or challenge but merely as a means to better, fairer, more creative governance.The same can and should be argued in urban settings. Look at the great success of the metro Mayors in England and Wales, delivering for their cities and regions because they can stand up to central government. In contrast, Scotland has a higher degree of centralisation than ever before. The challenge to that mindset could start in the islands and work its way in.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

She tweeted: ldquoThose responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned. Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately.The ersion of a plane owned by an EU company that was flying between two EU capitals and seizure of Protasevich was just the latest foreign policy test for the EU which often talks tough but seems less inclined to follow through with direct action. DAVID PRATT:Europe is once again facing threat from the far rightYes, admittedly, European leaders have already imposed three rounds of sanctions on Belarus and its President Alexander Lukashenko and other regime members following their crackdown on opposition activists in the wake of last yearrsquos presidential polls.That the EU will toughen its position even further is now inevitable evenit remains wary of over-doing things against Minsk for fear of pushing Lukashenko into even closer ties with Russia.The obvious option is to shun Belaruss airspace and ban national carrier Belavia from EU airports. But wider and tighter sanctions remain the key weapon in the EUrsquos arsenal evenas one senior diplomat said, ldquoIts not so easy to calibrate sanctionsyou want to spare the population.But eventougher sanctions are imposed, the inescapable fact is that for some time now, many have viewed EU sanctions as something of a paper tiger. Nowhere more so than perhaps Crimea on which sanctions were imposed in  following Russias invasion of Ukraine.Ostensibly, EU nationals were banned from doing business in Russia-occupied Crimea and those who harmed ldquothe territorial integrity of Ukraine were blacklisted.But as the online newspaper EUobserver highlighted only this week using the case of Greek billionaire, Ivan Savvidi, there are those who make a mockery of EU sanctions on Russia.Mr Savvidi himself is said to be actively engaged in food supplies to Crimea and openly funds pro-Russian occupation propaganda events say analysts who suggest that any comparable sanctions imposed against Belarus will be treated by Minsk with a similar disdain.On the other hand, this weekrsquos events could yet prove a watershed moment for EU foreign policy decisions that require a unanimous agreement by the  member states, something that in the past has often proved elusive.Irelandrsquos Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, noted that he had ldquonever seen such anger across the EU and many firmly believe that anger will now translate into unprecedented action.Certainly, this is the moment says the blocrsquos staunchest supporters when it needs to show it has a foreign policy that works and can be relied upon to be robust and as effective as the ldquosoft policy approach some within the EU appear to favour.The fact that even Hungaryrsquos Prime Minister Viktor Orban, not always known for being an EU team player, has come out in favour of tougher action against fellow authoritarian Mr Lukashenko, suggests that this time the EU might really mean business. Should however Mr Orban pull a U-turn and again use his veto to scupper any collective action this week, fellow EU leaders many will find it hard to forgive him.But itrsquos also worth noting that the situation right now in Belarus is not the only crisis currently testing the mettle of EU foreign policy. Another part of the world is also proving to be the arena in which an important sht in EU foreign and security policy is already underway and not without generating considerable controversy.Recently, in what is undoubtedly a toughening of stance, the European bloc for the first time is now allowed to arm governments in the name of fighting terrorism, protecting civilians, and stabilising fragile states. As the Financial Times reported just a few days ago, the money for this will come from a new eurobn fund over seven years known rather incongruously as the European Peace Facility .The EPF has been described as the most signicant expansion yet in growing EU efforts to project ldquohard power to influence international conflicts particularly in regions close to its borders such as eastern Europe and Africa. A likely focus of the EPF will be in the Sahel region of West Africa in countries like Mali, Chad, and Niger where French and other forces are already engaged in tackling Islamist-inspired terrorism. DAVID PRATT:Benjamin Netanyahu ndash the Harry Houdini of Israeli politicsldquoWe are not going to stop the terrorists from killing people just by preaching, insisted EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell recently.ldquoWe need arms. We need military capacities and that is what we are going to provide, to help our African friends. Because their security is our security, Mr Borrell added.But it goes without saying that many are less than convinced by such policies, pointing to intervention and supplies of arms in the likes of Iraq and Afghanistan as sobering lessons as to what can go wrong.ldquoThere is a growing contradiction in the EUrsquos approach to conflict and crises, says Lucia Montanaro, head of the EU office of Saferworld, a non-governmental group focused on conflicts.ldquoIts strong commitments to promoting human rights, gender equality and arms control are increasingly overshadowed by efforts to boost the combat capability of authoritarian partners, Ms Montanaro was cited by the FT as saying this week expressing the concern of others.On the face of it for an EU rhetorically committed to democracy and human rights it does seem like a signicant sht in foreign policy enactment on the ground. But this is the fluid ever shting geo-political world of which the EU is part and there is simply no escaping.Whether it be an assertive Russia, the threat of jihadism or what was tantamount to an act of ldquoair piracy on a flight between two EU capitals, the EU is rapidly concluding that simply talking about a response is sometimes not enough.David Pratt is Contributing Foreign Editor.

Two members of my family in their early s are still waiting for their first jab and would happily have turned up at the Hydro at short notice over the weekend to receive their first jab. Another family member of a similar age in Edinburgh has been trying to get through to the helpline having not received a letter yet. On one occasion she was th in the queue.How much longer do we have to tolerate this waste of professional time and potential vaccine wastage in Scotland when in other parts of the UK appointments can be booked online and vaccine uptake is much higher Gill Craig, Glasgow.NHS DATABASE IS FAILING USYOUR headline story about roughly half of vaccine appointments being missed at The Hydro in Glasgow may well be linked to the NHS database being out of date in some cases.Im aware of two examples where vaccine letters were sent to people who had been absent from the addresses in question for many years. One of them arrived at my own address recently for a previous occupant, a student who left Glasgow in  tohome to China. I ed it to the sender.The second case is even more extreme. I have a friend in Leipzig who used to live in East Kilbride. He has been living in Germany for more than  years and, since Brexit, is now a German citizen. A letter with a vaccine appointment arrived at his former East Kilbride address recently and was forwarded to him by his sister, who still lives at the property. He attempted to cancel the appointment online but discovered to his consternation that this was not possible. The system would only allow him to reschedule it. He eventually gave up.While I have nothing but praise for the NHS in the attempts to have people vaccinated as quickly as possible, the evidence suggests that they have no administrative mechanism for updating their recordspeople do not contact them with this information. Electoral registration officers actively check current residency on a semi-regular basis. Why can the NHS not do the same Dave Stewart, Glasgow.* I HAVE been unsuccessful in cancelling a Covid- vaccination appointment for my son, who has not resided in the UK for seven years. There appears to be no facility online to cancel, only to reschedule, and after learning I was th in the queue on the vaccination helpline, unsurprisingly I gave up trying.

Yet in Glasgow thousands of people failed to turn up for Covid jag appointments at the SSE Hydro at the weekend, wasting resources and putting themselves and others at continuing risk of catching the disease.Some of the absentees from the jab appointments may have ethical or religious issues to overcome before getting the vaccine, but the huge numbers not turning up would seem to suggest that it went far beyond that, with complacency and hesitancy creeping in. There is less chance of the city being downgraded from Level the population is complacent about Covid, dissuading tourists from visiting the city and impacting on struggling businesses.

Irsquom sure all our thoughts are with the young activist and his girlfriend, as well as the many other iniduals currently incarcerated for trying to counter this contemptible regime.The Westrsquos moral outrage on the matter is seriously undermined, however, by its complicity in the equally shameful abductions of foreign nationals by the United States, often from third countries, and the covert transport of these people to secret locations for interrogation and illegal detention.While in no way legitimising the Belarusian actions, American insistence on extensive extraterritorial jurisdiction and complete immunity from independent oversight over its many breaches of international law provides dictatorial governments such as Alexander Lukashenkorsquos with the opportunity to claim precedents have been set.Indignation expressed by the US, UK and others rings hollow against the background of history.

That is the obstacle to peace.

However, I would make two points.First, the appropriate time for the authorities to have initiated this idea would have been when those of the st who were at the scene were alive. Many, like my father, died believing that their stand had been virtually ignored amidst the regular Dunkirk remembrances.Secondly, while I am hopefully wrong in this concern, I harbour doubts that the underlying reason for the belated recognition of the event is at least in part an effort to promote the Union in the face of the current increase in the cause of Scottish independence.Please do remember those who were there and others who fought against Nazi tyranny, but do it for the right reasons.Archie Hamilton, Glasgow.Read more: Half of Glasgow Hydro vaccine appointments were no shows over weekend"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12623330.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kevin-mckenna-cummings-statements-reveal-covid-19-response-shambolic","story":"THE question by Rebecca Long-Bailey in todayrsquos evidence session of the Health and Social Care Committee cut to the heart of the UKrsquos shambolic response to Coronavirus.The Labour MP asked Dominic Cummings about his tweet last week that pointed to ldquodestructive behaviour in the political system.

The whole thing takes a skilled person about eight hours at least.The problem ndash and itrsquos the same with sporrans ndash is there are lots of cheap imports around, which has put the traditional craft under pressure.

I also spoke to the historian Patrick Watt about tartan and his experience was similar.

But all Irsquod say to that is: check your history. It may not be true, as some people think, that Highland dress was invented by Walter Scott, but the modern romantic image was popularised and spread by Queen Victoria.

A key witness eager to unburden himself and point the finger on an issue with the highest possible stakes. We will not see its like again for some time, I bet.Parliamentary committees, whether examining government departments or poring over legislation, are rarely so compelling. Especially at Holyrood.One of the interesting dferences between yesterdayrsquos session and the typical Scottish Parliament offering was who was in charge.:Cummings paints surreal picture of goings-on at dysal Number  ndash Westminster sketchOpening the questions and setting the tone of blunt inquiry was Greg Clark, a minister from the outset of the Toriesto power in , who held two cabinet posts and is now chair of the Commons science and technology select committee.The other lead inquisitor was Jeremy Hunt, a three-time cabinet secretary from  to  who now chairs the health and social care committee.It is not unusual for former big beasts to chair select committees, posts that are not only elected by MPs, conferring authority, but are remunerated at pound, a year, so the occupants have to earn their keep.It helps maintain the tradition of independent-minded scrutiny, even by MPs of the governing party.The experience former ministers bring to the job is also invaluable as they know best how the system works and how best to penetrate the wiles and evasions of officialdom.Both Mr Clark and Mr Hunt are Tories perfectly willing to make le hard for a Tory Prime Minister.Yes, both were Remainers ousted in Boris Johnsonrsquos first reshuffle, so there may be personal factors at play, but they are still part of a healthier-than-Holyrood system where loyalty to onersquos party is not paramount.Meanwhile in Edinburgh, it is rare for recent ministers to be committee conveners, and rarer still for former cabinet secretaries to take on the role.In the - Scottish parliament, there were only three former SNP ministers who led committees, and only two in the - session, when one former cabinet secretary also fleetingly took charge of a committee for two recess months one year.In Westminster, committee chair is a perfectly respectable afterle for a former minister or cabinet secretary, with remuneration offering lsquojam todayrsquo to make up for the workload.Holyrood is quite dferent. Conveners are not elected by the parliament as a whole, but by the MSPs on each committee.:Battle royal looms as William and Kate deployed to bolster the UnionWith parties choosing which MSPs go where, it gives the government of the day a huge say in who gets many of the gigs, and naturally it has no wish to implant thorns in its own side.Convenerships are very often the stepping stones to ministerial office.There is no remuneration for the considerable amount of extra graft.Instead, there is the lure of lsquojam tomorrowrsquo in the form of promotion.That incentivises loyalty to the government and not causing a fuss.Other MSPs of the governing party follow this example. Mavericks, such as Alex Neil, are welcome but rare.Holyroodrsquos committee system was famously supposed to be the jewel in its crown, offering the scrutiny of a second chamber without the cost.But as we enter a sixth parliamentary term, its clear theyrsquove been a let-down, arguably reaching their nadir in the gutless toadying from some SNP MSPs during the Alex Salmond inquiry.Some problems come down to the parliamentrsquos size. The talent pool is more paddling than ing.Even with the SNP having close to a majority, around a fth of all MSPs are part of the government, and so unavailable for committee duty.Infrequent reshuffles mean a low turnover in ministers, so government experience is lacking among the rest.The present First Ministerrsquos habit of re-hiring old hands also leaves former ministers who are on committees wonderingthey might one day , so best to bite their tongue.There have been many tinkering attempts at reform. In , then Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick asked the Standards Committee to investigate the case for elected conveners, an idea she supported.ldquoIf conveners were elected by the whole Parliament, they would derive their authority and mandate from the Parliament itself, she said.ldquoThis sht of responsibility... would strengthen the role of the Parliament and so enhance the sharing of power between the government, the Parliament and the people.The Committee preferred fudge, concluding the Parliament ldquoshould set aside the idea on elected conveners and discuss general scrutiny instead.The next PO, Ken Macintosh, tried again, establishing an independent commission on parliamentary reform to help improve scrutiny.It backed elected conveners, with procedures in place from the start of the current session, with potential remuneration based on workload.The committees have yet to be formed for this session, but there is no sign yet of any elections or pay bumps.Instead, it looks like the same old patronage and pusillanimity.Nicola Sturgeon yesterday promised ldquounashamedly ambitious policies for the coming term, while priding herself on Holyrood not transplanting ldquothe old ways of Westminster.But grand plans merit deep scrutiny and Holyrood doesnrsquot offer it.ldquoWe do not claim a monopoly of wisdom, the First Minister added.In that case,some Westminster ways are worth importing, do it."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-question-time-tonight","story":"Fiona Bruce once again s to host the BBC flagship political show.Dominic Cummings made waves as he gave evidence in front of a joint parliamentary committee on the UK Governmentrsquos handling of the Covid- pandemic, the SNP opened talks with the Scottish Greens over a cooperation deal and the UKcontinued to respond to the ongoing pandemic.:Dominic Cummings: Key evidence from ex-aides bombshell testimonyWith a host of political hot topics, we take a look at who is on the  and what viewers can expect as MPs and political commentators face questions from a virtual audience.Grant ShappsThe UK Secretary of State for Transport will be on the Question Time  this evening as the UK Governmentrsquos representative. Viewers can expect some clashes over the governmentrsquos Covid response, travel rules and more.Shapps was also recently involved in a signicant rail reform in England, which included the creation of a new public body called Great British Railwaystaking over responsibility for managing infrastructure, issuing contracts to train operators, setting fares and selling tickets.The former Conservative chairman recently made headlines after he said a loophole that will not allow disgraced MP Rob Roberts to lose his seat for breaching sexual misconduct rules needed to be closed. He said: ldquoAlthough itrsquos a decision for the House of Commons, I rather agree that this loophole does need to be closed.The MP for Welywn Hatfield since  earlier this week also insisted that communication around Covid hotspots in England ldquocould have been clearer On the UKrsquos communication he said: ldquoItrsquos important to say there are no new local lockdowns, no change in the law ndash the law is the same throughout England with regards to coronavirus.:Grant Shapps announces  countries you can travel to from May ldquoBut I think it would also be churlish not to say that the communications could have been clearer and this was in essence simply guidance or advice just to remind people living in areas where the level happens to be quite a lot higher than the national average of the sensible things to do.The MP also was vocal in support for Roman Protasevich was on board a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius on Sunday when it was forced to change course to head for the Belarus capital after a reported bomb scare, escorted by a MiG fighter jet.Shapps usually votes with his party on issues such as defence and spending, but has dferences on aspects such as a wholly elected House of Lords, Grant Shapps generally voted for a wholly elected House of Lords.

She has held Brexit, Defence, and Foreign Office portfolios in Jeremy Corbynrsquos cabinet.The MP for Islington South and Finsbury, a position she has held since , recently made headlines after expressing concern over a trade deal with Australia which has sparked a backlash fromfarmers over concerns over granting tarf-free access which would threaten British farmers. She said: ldquoIf Liz Truss cannot negotiate a trade deal with Australia on the terms she herself proposed last year, the fault lies squarely at her door.ldquoSo instead of blaming her Cabinet colleagues or the National Farmersrsquo Union for these dficulties, she should get on with her job, and deliver the deal that she promised.ldquoItrsquos perfectly normal that the Australian government should try to get the best possible deal for its agricultural mega-corporations.She also recently expressed concern over freeports. In a letter written to Liz Truss she said: ldquoLast November, when the Treasury invited applications for its new freeports scheme, the small print warned potential bidders of the prohibition clauses contained in several continuity trade agreements the Department of Trade had signed in the previous two years.:Free port site for Scotland lsquocould be decided within monthsrsquoldquoBut, despite that warning, Liz Truss went on to sign trade agreements with  more countries containing the same clauses, including key markets like Canada, Singapore and Mexico.ldquoIt would have taken an hour of discussion and the stroke of a pen to explain the UKrsquos freeports policy to negotiators from these countries and remove the prohibition clauses from those agreements, and I cannot understand why Liz Truss failed to do that.ldquoOn the surface of it, this looks like a catastrophic blunder by a minister stuck in her silo, and, as a result, I fear that manufacturers in towns, cities and regions across our country who have succeeded in bidding for freeport status risk missing out on access to key markets.The once-Labour Leader hopeful hit the headlines last year when she stated that she would not report neighbours for breaching Covid- rules. She famously gave Jeremy Corbyn a   for his election performance as Labour leader. In an appearance on BBC Question Time in  she said she would negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU, but then campaign for Remain - against her own deal.Kate ClanchyThe Scottish poet, novelist, journalist and playwright will sit on the Question Time . The former teacher won the Orwell Prize in  for her book lsquoSome Kids I Taught and What They Taught Mersquo.

She has written for , Scotsman, New Statesman and more.Tom Newton DunnTom Newton Dunn will also sit on the BBC Question Time  this evening. The chief political commentator and host at Times Radio was also the political editor at The Sun for  years. He hosted the Tory Leadership Debate in  which saw Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson clash.He also made waves in the world of journalism in  after he reported on the Plebgate scandal, and was threatened with arresthe did not reveal his source, but did not do so.

With over  years in social care, the chairwoman will likely be able to offer insight into the governmentrsquos handling of the Covid- pandemic.She had previously been critical of the government not prioritising vaccines for those who work with the elderly, saying that non-NHS nursing staff were being left behind in February. She said: ldquoIt is worrying to note that staff working with vulnerable people in social care settings are in this invidious position.Speaking on Dominic Cummingsrsquo remarks about care homes she said: ldquoIt is with great sadness that listening to Mr Cummings it emerges that our initial thoughts and the evidence that was around us was right ndash that there was no shield around care homes, there was no thought on the impact on the vulnerable people that we care for.ldquoPeople were being discharged out of hospital into our services to save the NHS and put not only the people discharged, their lives, were put at risk, but the people who were in our services at risk.ldquoMy reaction is great disappointment that the sector was lied to from the outset ndash we were lied to about any plan, it is clear there was no plan we were lied to about the protective shield when we know there was no protective shield and it is disappointing to note that the testing that we were promised never took place.BBC Question Time airs on BBC One and BBC One Scotland at :pm"},{"url":null,"title":"catherine-heymans-named-first-female-astronomer-royal-scotland","story":"Catherine Heymans, a world-leading expert on the physics of the so-called dark universe, has been awarded the almost -year-old title.The astrophysicist was recommended to the Queen for the role by an international , convened by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Prof Heymans said: ldquoI donrsquot think anyone forgets the first time they saw the rings of Saturn through a telescope, but too many people never have the chance.ldquoAs Astronomer Royal for Scotland, I want to change that.ldquoMy hope is that once that spark and connection with the universe is made, children will carry that excitement home with them and develop a le-long passion for astronomy or, even better, science as a whole.ldquoI am absolutely delighted to be named Astronomer Royal for Scotland and as an advocate for equality and ersity, it is also a great honour to be the first woman appointed to the role.ldquoI will enthusiastically use this high-profile  to advance amateur and professional astronomy within Scotland and to promote Scotland internationally as a world-leading centre for science.Prof Heymans is professor of astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh and director of the German Centre for Cosmological Lensing at Ruhr-University Bochum.Her research seeks to shed light on the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter ndash entities that together account for more than % of the universe.Created in , the position of Astronomer Royal for Scotland was originally held by the director of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.Since  it has been awarded as an honorary title.The previous holder, John Brown, died in .As the th Astronomer Royal, Prof Heymansrsquos main focus will be on sharing her passion for astronomy with Scots from all walks of le.One of her first targets is to install telescopes at all of Scotlandrsquos remote outdoor learning centres, which are visited by most of the countryrsquos school pupils."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12647717.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-road-closures-announced-cop26-summit","story":"Details of roads close to the event at the citys SEC campus have been released for the first time along with a map.It comes as businesses are being invited to sign-up for an event to find out about the work being done to prepare Glasgow for the arrival COP.The virtual event is being organised as part of the Get Ready Glasgow campaign developed by Glasgow City Council in partnership with event organisers - the UK Government, and with Police Scotland and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.Read more:Scotlands covid memorial campaign boosted by trust fund donationAs host city of this potentially historic climate change summit, Glasgow is in a position to raise its profile globally as a sustainable city, attract investment to key sectors and promote itself as a visitor destination.Get Ready Glasgow campaign is aimed at keeping the city moving and open for business in the lead up to and during the COP conference.It will also be used to make sure the city is prepared to welcome visitors and that citizens feel confident and reassured about Glasgow hosting a covid-safe event.The event comes as details of the impact of the conference on this cityrsquos road network around the main venue, the SEC, and river restrictions are announced.

It now influences our thoughts and actions in innumerable ways, so it is essential that we are properly informed about it. The more we understand, the more we can do to combat it.Learning is the key to this, and itrsquos an area in which Scotland is emerging as a global leader. Today, The Herald is launching an exciting and empowering new programme that aims to bring climate change discussion and solutions to iniduals and organisations everywhere ndash not just in this country, but around the world.Our Herald Climate Solutions initiative is linked with Climate Solutions Network, a pioneering new initiative developed by The Royal Scottish Geographical Society in association with the Institute of Directors , Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and Jump Digital.This ground-breaking project offers two compelling courses allowing participants to learn about the climate crisis and how they can help to address it.One is the Climate Solutions Professional., which consists of four easy-to-follow web-based modules and an online workshop. It will help time-poor managers to understand climate issues and their relevance to their organisations and personal lives.The second is Climate Solutions Accelerator, an express online learning programme which teaches the basics in vital areas such as climate science and policy legislation and offers ideas around solutions in just  minutes.Both courses feature highly motivational materials as well as contributions from some of the worldrsquos leading figures in the fight against climate change.Those featured include global campaigner Greta Thunberg, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, ex-Irish President Mary Robinson, former Norwegian Premier Gro Harlem Brundtland and recent UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.The programmes are the brainchild of Mike Robinson, CEO of the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society and a veteran climate change and sustainability campaigner.In  he helped found, and chaired, Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, the largest civil society coalition ever formed in this country.What drove him to launch this new programme  ldquoIt became obvious to me that far too many people still didnrsquot understand the relevance of climate change to their businesses and they didnrsquot have the time to sort that out, he explains. ldquoI realised I had built up a lot of knowledge in this area and that there wasnrsquot anything out there that could teach people what they could do. So I got together with the IoD and Edinburgh and Stirling Universities to produce this course.The full four-module course has recently been launched and contains some  hours of online learning as well as the two workshops. ldquoThere is a lot of expertise crammed into it. We had already had about  people subscribe to it, including  in the Scottish Government.ldquoItrsquos aimed at people who are managers, directors or board members ndash anyone who wants to have a robust organisation. Wersquove got people signed up from a whole range of sectors and I think that is part of its appeal. The point is that climate change is now pervasive. It goes beyond the Sustainability Officer or a single department.ldquoItrsquos going to impact every aspect of organisations, so itrsquos really important that everyone from the board through to Finance Directors through to those in personnel, HR, purchasing and other areas has a better and more rounded understanding of where this is all going.ldquoWe do touch on the science, though that has been settled for quite a long time and we only tell people what they really need to know. Then therersquos another part that is about the inevitability of the direction of travel.ldquoPeople need to realise the ways things are going on this ndash the forthcoming COP conference in Glasgow later this year is a case in point. International commitments on climate change are ramping up year on year.The shorter, single session Climate Solutions Accelerator programme offers the basics in an easy-to-digest fashion. Several organisations have signed up to put their entire senior management, and in some cases their entire workforce, through one or other of the two courses. And this appeal is global.ldquoOne major US company enrolled some of its Scottish staff in an early session of the full course and quickly decided that the learning and knowledge gained needed to be rolled out to all its staff globally, more to follow on this. Wersquore getting a sense now that there is a really strong appetite for this sort of thing ndash businesses really want to understand the issues and get on top of them quickly.ldquoThe global names wersquove brought in on both of the programmes to help convey the message have helped with the content and to make it clear why people need to wake up to this issue.Although the courses are attracting interest worldwide,Mike Robinson says that they are unapologetically Scottish. ldquoCountries are at dferent points and therersquos no question that Scotland is well ahead of the rest of the world on this journey.ldquoNo-one is perfect in this, but the UK is the leading country on addressing climate issues in the G and Scotland is the leader within the UK, with much more stringent commitments than the other parts. That means that we have a responsibility, but there is also an opportunity for us in terms of leadership. Itrsquos about helping people understand the whole of the debate so they can be better informed and better prepared. I hope that by taking the courses, they will be better able to build change and deliver the future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12587103.jpg?type=article-full","title":"lorna-slater-scottish-greens-optimistic-formal-agreement-snp-holyrood","story":"Ms Slater said that she \"wouldnt expect\" any deal between the parties to mirror the format set down by alliances between the Liberal Democrats with both Labour and the Conservatives at Holyrood and Westminster in recent years.The newly-elected MSP said that talks with Nicola Sturgeons SNP were in a very early stage and may not be resolved for months, and that both parties were looking for common ground.:Nicola Sturgeon in talks with Greens over groundbreaking cooperation dealThe First Minister announced yesterday thather SNP Government is holding talks with the Scottish Greens over a possible \"formal cooperation agreement\".The First Minister said the move could see Green MSPs entering the Scottish Government as ministers.Structured talks, supported by the civil service, will now take place with a view to reaching a deal between the SNP and the Greens.Ms Slater is no-leader with Patrick HarvieSpeaking this morning, Ms Slater said that the aim was to establish a \"new kind of politics\".She told BBC Radio Scotland: \"What were hoping to achive is to create a dferent kind of working environment in the Scottish Parliament to prioritize the kind of things that really matter to the Scottish Green Party - which is a fair and green recovery from the pandemic.\"To put practical actions in place to tackle the climate crisis.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These things provide important pillars of support and it was these things that were publicly trashed.The judge referred to evidence given by Mrs Foster suggesting the timing of the tweet may have been deliberately chosen to undermine negotiations concerning the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive.He said: ldquoI do not ascribe to the defendant having the knowledge of, or interest in Northern Ireland politics which would be a prerequisite to giving any detailed consideration to the possibility that the timing of this tweet was intended to influence the outcome of the negotiations.ldquoHowever, in respect of the anonymous tweets which preceded the defendantrsquos much more prominent statement, such a motivation cannot be dismissed out of hand.Mr Justice McAlinden ordered Dr Jessen to pay damages of pound, and Mrs Fosterrsquos legal costs.Giving evidence last month, Mrs Foster told the court she was left humiliated by the unfounded rumour of an affair with a close protection officer which ldquotrashed her -year marriage. vw,vw,px, px\"Arlene Fosterrsquos solicitor Paul Tweed Speaking outside the High Court, Mrs Fosterrsquos solicitor Paul Tweed said: ldquoMy client is very satisfied with the substantial sum in damages awarded by the court today.

This month, a group of people from around the country have decided to make their work-outs matter for those who need it most, by running in support of international relief development charity, Tearfund.Saraand Ricardo will be running km each day while currently teaching in Malaysia. Sara teaches Reception-aged children and Ricardo teaches maths to secondary students. “Running in Malaysia has certainly been hot, humid and sweaty’, Sara says, “But it is a worthy challenge. My husband and I dont run regularly so it has been good to spend time working on our stamina, especially in a hot climate. “Running has also many mental health benefits and as we are in Lockdown # here in Malaysia, it is good to get outside and go for a run to clear the head.”The pair have been in Malaysia since .The group of  members is together covering the distance between Belfast and the very tip of North Africa - , kms, over the month of May. Running mainly in Northern Ireland with a few international participants in Malaysia, Lincolnshire and Geneva, they hope to raise pound, for Tearfund - which could help up to , families living in poverty with health and hygiene training and food support as they await safe access to a Covid-vaccine.Millions of people in Northern Ireland are now partially or fully vaccinated. But for billions of people around the world, a vaccine is still a long way off. It is estimated that amongst people living in poverty, only  in  will access a safe vaccine this year with most others having to wait until next year or even  before they are able to.Sara says, ‘Covid- has affected so many people around the world in many dferent ways. From the loss of jobs to the loss of loved ones, it has been a very dficult time for many. “We are both fortunate that we have been able to work from home and that our families are safe. We feel it is so important to help others in need, especially during this dficult time. “To raise money for food to feed families and to support those in need of imminent healthcare is something we should all consider doingwe can.’Glen Mitchell, Tearfund’s NI Director, says: “We talk about the pandemic being a storm we are all experiencing, but in very dferent boats. This inequality has never been more evident than when it comes to the access to Covid- vaccines.AMPLE DOSES“Those of us who live in countries with enough resource to purchase ample doses of the vaccine are often also those who can afford to social distance and freely access things like clean water or soap. “For many people living in poverty, going to work in crowded spaces is their only chance at putting food on the table for their families. Still others, in refugee camps for example, have no way of isolating. “Many others have to walk for miles in order to access clean water, which they then have to ration through the day,’ he added.“Tearfunds core values are centred around compassion and being servant-hearted,” notes Sara.“The work that they have done and continue to do to help those in poverty or in the face of natural disasters is humbling. “We had heard of the km a day in May challenge through word of mouth and wanted to be part of it to help families. “To know that pound can provide a family with health and hygiene training and food support for  months whilst they wait for the vaccine, really motivated us to jump on board and do our bit to help!“For over  years, Tearfund has walked alongside communities around the world as they respond to disasters, including supporting people living with HIV and those affected by recent Ebola outbreaks. Tearfund helps communities to recover and create a more resilient new normal’. VULNERABLE“And now, Tearfund is working through local partners in more than  countries where the most vulnerable people need help with emergency food and hygiene supplies before, during and after Covid- vaccines become available. “Tearfund is playing a vital role by preventing the spread of the virus through improved hygiene and sanitation and supporting our locally based partners and churches to m“ake a meaningful, sustained response. While people are waiting for access to the vaccination, it is important to act to mitigate the spread of the virus and its impacts.The aid and development organisation is also working to spread accurate information about Covid- vaccines. ‘Alongside our work tackling poverty, we are also helping church leaders and organisations to use their influence to build a good understanding of the Covid- vaccines and help shape and support vaccination programmes that are good for society, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised.”From the support she and Ricardo have received, Sara is encouraged: “We have been blown away by the generosity of our friends and family during our km a day in May challenge. “It has also been great to be part of a community with others who are also completing the challenge. “The simple words of encouragement and opportunity for accountability with pictures and Strava screenshots has really helped to spur us both on each day for our next run. “The Tearfund staff have provided helpful tips and cheered us on every step of the way!”To make a donation in support of Tearfund’s work responding to coronavirus around the world and support Sara and Ricardo’s running challenge, visit their Justgiving page at https:justgiving fundraising Sara-Braganza.

Credit: William Cherry PresseyeMargaret CanningTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailBusinesses from coach firms to bakeries which were open during the latest lockdown but still lost out on trade are to benefit from over £m in support.The Department of Finance announced it will start issuing top-up grants of £, or £, today.The funds are being distributed to support enterprises which suffered from a lack of footfall as a result of the restrictions during the latest shutdown, which began on Boxing Day.Even though eligible firms were open to customers, they still lost out on trade because the businesses around them were closed, and because there were fewer customers in circulation.More than , businesses are receiving the top-up grants. Over , businesses will receive a £, top up while over , businesses will receive a £, top-up.They are being made to firms which received grants of £, or £, at the outset of the pandemic but did not get support from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, which gave grants to firms which had to shut in the lockdown.Finance Minister Conor Murphy visited two businesses which will receive the top-up grants –delicatessen Sawers in Belfast city centre and a Centra convenience store in the city#s Cathedral Quarter.Sawers managing director Kieran Sloan described days over lockdown where not a single customer visited his shop as people abided by government advice to stay at home to stem the spread of the virus.By sharp contrast the city was bustling yesterday afternoon as he welcomed Mr Murphy through his doors.The minister was shown the shop#s array of produce, including caviar, pizza making ingredients which became more popular over lockdown and some hot sauces which have also increased in popularity thanks to online challenges.Mr Sloan described how his long established business had to adapt to the pandemic, with more deliveries and increasing its online presence.We had to change,you didn#t change, you died and that was it, he said.Footfall dropped by nearly %, we had no-one in town. There were days when we did not have one customer in. I was standing in there by myself, we had no staff, they were all on furlough. It was frightening.Footfall then came back, because we are a destination shop, people began to come to us.But it was great on Monday to see everyone open again.It#s not back to normal but it#s great to see people around and Saturdays are coming back to the old Saturdays again.Mr Murphy also visited Donagh McGoveran#s Centra shop in the Cathedral Quarter. The shop saw sales drop by %.It was a signicant jolt to the business, he said.Mr McGoveran opened the business during a time of buzz in the Cathedral Quarter with the extension of the nearby Ulster University campus and more student accommodation being built.It had a transformational effect on this part of the city so the pandemic was a devastating blow for all the shops in the area, he said.We got a bit of an increase in footfall in September last year when things started to open up, but then we went back into full lockdown later in the year and things really didn#t start to recover until the last week or so, we#ve seen a bit of a buzz about the city centre.Hospitality opening up has really helped us in terms of people coming into the city centre.Mr Murphy said he recognised that stores’ trade and footfall was impacted as a result of the restrictions – whenthey could remain open.“I have been determined throughout the pandemic to ensure support reaches as many businesses as possible,” he said.These top up payments will benefit thousands of small and medium sized businesses across retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure and manufacturing which were unable to access Executive business support schemes.This grant will cover a wider range of business including convenience stores, hardware stores, bakeries, financial services, engineering firms, and coach services to name a few.”The department said that Land  Property Services will be carrying out verication work to make sure the properties are still occupied by the same owners who received the original grant.And those which firms only started trading after the deadlines for the £K small business support grant and the £K retail, tourism, hospitality and leisure grant had closed can apply online for the top-up from late June, the department said.Mr Murphy said the reopening of businesses this week was a positive step forward for the economy but that it would take time for trading toto pre-pandemic levels.Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said: “Retail NI is pleased that the Finance Minister and his department have listened to our views and concerns and responded with this grant scheme.”Most ReadBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseRevealed: NI#s most popular baby names in Stephen Nolan ponders dye as hair goes #Santa Claus white#Top VideosPlayFrom Jeff Goldblum to Spider-Man: The most bizarre moments from Cummings# evidencePlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCovid vaccination programme opens to everyone in Northern IrelandDodds launches ‘ambitious’ skills plan to boost innovation and grow economy NI medical chief will not be drawn on Cummings’ attackLatestDerry duo awarded £k by Netflix to create new rap documentaryHancock and Johnson respond to Cummings’ attacks on them£ banknote presented to Harold Macmillan sells for £,Macron admits to French guilt over role in  Rwandan genocidePolice officers accused of sharing murder scene photos ‘sorry beyond measure’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Most ReadBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseRevealed: NI#s most popular baby names in Stephen Nolan ponders dye as hair goes #Santa Claus white#Top VideosPlayFrom Jeff Goldblum to Spider-Man: The most bizarre moments from Cummings# evidencePlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCovid vaccination programme opens to everyone in Northern Ireland£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownDodds launches ‘ambitious’ skills plan to boost innovation and grow economy LatestDerry duo awarded £k by Netflix to create new rap documentaryHancock and Johnson respond to Cummings’ attacks on them£ banknote presented to Harold Macmillan sells for £,Macron admits to French guilt over role in  Rwandan genocidePolice officers accused of sharing murder scene photos ‘sorry beyond measure’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic PARalph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailDUP MLA Jonathan Buckley criticised BBC Radio Ulster presenter Chris Buckler for questioning him over party members voicing their “disgust” at the ousting of outgoing party leader Arlene Foster during a discussion on health waiting lists.The Upper Bann representative accused the broadcaster of politicising health. The DUP’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone association said on Wednesday night it was standing behind Arlene Foster, adding: “This was not done in our name.”The post was shared by East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson on his Facebook page and the East Belfast DUP association.Read MoreOusting of Foster not in our name, says Fermanagh DUPEdwin Poots set to be confirmed as leader by party chiefsIt came on the eve of Edwin Poots’ ratication as DUP leader.Upper Bann MLA Mr Buckley appeared on BBC Radio Ulster’s Good Morning Ulster on Thursday during a discussion on Northern Ireland’s waiting lists.At the end of debate, Mr Buckler asked the politician what he thought of the “extraordinary” DUP Fermanagh and South Tyrone association statement andit was done in his name.Mr Buckley instead dodged the question.He said the presenter had spent the first half of Good Morning Ulster “lambasting politicians for getting political on an issue such as waiting lists”.Mr Buckler quickly replied and stated it was an “entirely fair question”.Mr Buckley responded: “Sorry Chris,you let me finish my statement, what I am trying to say is that I am not collating the two.“I am here on your programme this morning to talk about waiting lists. It affects everybody.“I am not here to get into the minutiae of party political politics. I’m here to talk about waiting lists and at that I will have no further comment.”He again said he did not want to “conflate” the issue with health when asked again about Arlene Foster’s treatment on the BBC Stephen Nolan show. Mr Nolan made it clear to his listeners the matter should not be conflated.“What I am highlighting today is waiting lists,” Mr Buckley added.I am not going to give you another story which may feed into the narrative some in the BBC may want to portray. I am here to talk about waiting lists,” he said.“I will continue to conduct my business within the DUP as I always have, which is internal and conversations with people whom I respect and trust.”Askedhe thought Arlene Foster had done a good job, he said he wished the First Minister well and looked forward to engaging with her.Mr Poots defeated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson by  votes to  in the leadership contest two weeks ago and will formally take over on Thursday.Mrs Foster’s home constituency said it would continue to “stand firm by her side”.“Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP Association met this week to voice their disgust at the manner in which our party leader, First Minister and local MLA RT Hon Arlene Foster has been treated over recent weeks,” it said.“Arlene has worked tirelessly over the years not just for Fermanagh and South Tyrone but right across Northern Ireland — helping all constituencies.“Our Association is sending out a strong message to Arlene Foster. This was not done in our name.“The Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP association have unanimously backed Arlene Foster to remain as our MLA, however we recognise this is a personal decision.“We appreciate that Arlene has sacriced so much personally over the years for public service, but this Association will stand firm by her side.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseStephen Nolan ponders dye as hair goes #Santa Claus white#Revealed: NI#s most popular baby names in Top VideosPlayFrom Jeff Goldblum to Spider-Man: The most bizarre moments from Cummings# evidencePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeeLatest Northern IrelandPresenter Christian Jessen told to pay Arlene Foster £, over  tweetDerry duo awarded £k by Netflix to create new rap documentaryI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetTV doctor Christian Jessen ordered to pay Arlene Foster £, for  tweetComic Con in NI: Vampire Diaries star to appear at next year’s pop-culture eventLatestAlex KaneOpinionThe problems are already mounting for Poots… luckily for him none of his rivals are ready to take advantageCouple donate m euro to Trinity College DublinPresenter Christian Jessen told to pay Arlene Foster £, over  tweetRees-Mogg: It would be honourable for disgraced MP Roberts to stand downRapper Pa Salieu denies wounding charge,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PA.Ralph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe RNLI and HM Coastguard have launched a new safety campaign urging everyone to choose leguarded beaches when they visit the coast.With continued uncertainty over foreign holidays and international travel, the RNLI has predicted this summer will be the busiest ever as Covid restrictions are eased and people choose to staycation.Last summer, RNLI leguards rescued  people and dealt with  incidents on  Northern Ireland beaches.There are  leguarded beaches in Northern Ireland: Ballycastle, Benone Strand, Castlerock, Cranfield, Downhill Strand, Murlough, Portrush’s East, West and West Harbour beaches, Portstewart, Tyrella and Whiterocks.In a survey commissioned by the RNLI, % of those questioned - aged  to  - said they expect to visit a UK beach or the coast between April and September, with around half of that number likely to do so three or more times.A signicantly higher proportion of the publicalso said they plan to visit the coast more than usual this year, compared to  .Head of Water Safety at the RNLI Gareth Morrison urged everyone to “respect the water”, think about their own safety and know what to do in an emergency.“Our main advice is to visit a leguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags,” he said.“RNLI leguards will be patrolling  beaches in Northern Ireland this summer to offer advice on how to stay safe and they are also there to help anyone who gets into trouble.“Coastal areas provide a great opportunity to enjoy fresh air and open space but they can be an unpredictable and dangerous environment, particularly during early summer when air temperatures start warming up but water temperatures remain dangerously cold, increasing the risk of cold water shock.”The key summer safety advice is visit a leguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags,you get into trouble ‘Float to Live’ – lie on your back and relax, resisting the urge to thrash about - and call  in an emergency and ask for the coastguard.Across the UK last year, RNLI leguards saved  lives, aided , people - including , involving bodyboards and  with inflatables – responded to , incidents and made more than . million preventative actions.Director of HM Coastguard Claire Hughes, added: “Before setting out, take a minute to check the weather, tides and winds to help avoid getting caught out.“Leave inflatables at home as they are designed for the pool, not open water, where the wind and current can very quickly take you out to sea and into danger.“Recreational watersports such as paddleboarding are now incredibly popular and we’d encourage everyone to make it a fun rather than frightening experience.“It pays to prepare and taking a mobile phone in a waterproof pouch when you set out for a paddle will mean you can call for helpneeded.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseRevealed: NI#s most popular baby names in Stephen Nolan ponders dye as hair goes #Santa Claus white#Top VideosPlayFrom Jeff Goldblum to Spider-Man: The most bizarre moments from Cummings# evidencePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeeLatest Northern IrelandDerry duo awarded £k by Netflix to create new rap documentaryI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetTV doctor Christian Jessen ordered to pay Arlene Foster £, for  tweetComic Con in NI: Vampire Diaries star to appear at next year’s pop-culture event‘Shambles’ as NI private hospitals ruled out of helping tackle out-of-control waiting listsLatestAlex KaneOpinionThe problems are already mounting for Poots… luckily for him none of his rivals are ready to take advantageRees-Mogg: It would be honourable for disgraced MP Roberts to stand downRapper Pa Salieu denies wounding chargeWilliam and Kate join children to showcase their gardening and tennis skillsTrio of kittens born with a total of twelve extra toes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The coup, which cleaned out bookies in Ireland and England, was simple but brilliantly conceived and executed.Curley had noted that there was only one public telephone at the racetrack at Bellewstown in the heart of rural Ireland. There was also a private line, but mysteriously it was out of action that day, presumed to have been cut. In tandem with the Belfast bookie Sean Graham, Curley had organised a small army of associates to bet anything from £ to £ in bookie shops around Ireland and England on his “slow but steady” horse Yellow Sam, running in the .pm Mount Hanover Amateur Handicap hurdle that Wednesday. But crucially he had to prevent news of the gamble getting to the course in order to keep the odds at  .Five minutes before the bets were laid, Benny O’Hanlon, an associate of Curley’s, wedged himself into the only working telephone box at the course and refused to budge, preventing news of the money piling on the horse being relayed to the on-course bookies. So Yellow Sam, a rank outsider with jockey Michael Furlong on board, passed the winning post well ahead of the rest of the field. Curley made an estimated £, on that single race.“We paid out like men,” said the Dublin bookie Terry Rodgers, ruefully. “But what annoyed me later on was the revelation that Curley and Graham had been in cahoots, which is a bit rich for a guy who is always going on about bookies rigging the market. It’s fortunate for Barney that he trained as a theologian, because he can justy everything he does to his Jesuitical conscience.”Curley then bought Middleton Park, a stately home on nearly  acres on the shores of Lough Ennell, in Co Westmeath. It was originally the ancestral home of Sir Cecil Boyd-Rochford, horse trainer to British royalty. At the foot of the great staircase he told me in  that his main reasons for disposing of the mansion was because the Irish telephone system was so unreliable, he didn’t know who might be listening in on the line as he planned his secretive gambling exploits.But instead of selling the estate he raffled it. With an elaborate brochure, a video featuring racing and GAA commentator, Michael O’Hehir and appearances on RTE’s Late Late Show and other media he grossed an estimated £.m selling , tickets at £ each. But when gardai raided the house the week before the draw, they came away with just one ticket, leaving Curley with a warning that what he was doing was illegal.With the draw due to take place at pm on Thursday, February , , in a nearby hotel, Curley surmised that the gardai might seize the tickets before the winner could be picked. In a pre-emptive strike at am that morning, as several gardai arrived following a front page story in the Evening Herald, O’Hehir hastily drew the winning ticket bearing the name of Tony Ray.Curley and O’Hehir were arrested and appeared before Judge William Tormey at Ballynacargy District Court, charged with running an illegal lottery. O’Hehir was cleared as his was a “professional” assignment. The judge, a racing man himself, convicted Curley of a “blatant and illegal” breach of the Lotteries Act and dramatically sentenced him to three months in prison.On appeal just days later, he was given the Probation Acthe agreed to donate £, to St Vincent de Paul. Curley wrote a cheque for £, and walked out a free man with an estimated £m in his back pocket, for a house that was sold some years later for £,.Bernard Joseph Curley, who died last Sunday of cancer at his home in Newmarket, England at the age of , was born in Irvinestown, Co Fermanagh. His parents were Catholic, but his father, a shopkeeper, was an “enthusiastic” gambler and drinker who often left the family in dire financial straits.Curley was educated at the Jesuit seminary of Mungret College, Limerick but left after falling ill with TB shortly before he was due to be ordained.“People were dying all around me like flies,” he said later. “There was not much to be scared about after that.”In his autobiography Giving a Little Back, he said he never held down a regular job. He ran a pub, went bust as a bookie, and then became a showband manager with Frankie McBride and the Polka Dots, getting them into the British charts in  with the slushy ballad, Five Little Fingers.At a gig in Killarney, he was introduced to Maureen Curley from St Helen’s in Lancashire, England and when they married, he estimated that given there were so few Curleys in the world their union was a  million to one shot.But it wasn’t all big paydays. He recalled nursing losses of £, after betting against Vincent O’Brien’s Golden Fleece, favourite for the  Epsom Derby. “My judgment just misfired completely,” he wrote. “A lesser man might have been persuaded to pack it in immediately, but I never panicked and I didn’t allow it to get to me. I took Maureen and the kidsto Calornia and effectively retired for three months.”After the Middleton Park raffle, he moved to Newmarket and took out a trainer’s licence.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship. Then you have the Longford story with one win in four games. Add in two wins from four against Laois, another team Derry would fancy beating. In Ulster, Derry have won just  times in  games, with that one draw thrown in. On the face of it, the result looks grim, but scratch the surface and  of those games were against either Donegal or Tyrone. Of that,  were in the first round. The  win, under the baking sun in Ballybofey, was Derrys only win over Donegal in eight attempts. Of the eight clashes with Tyrone, the famous  win in Omagh, when the Red Hands were All-Ireland champions, is the only victory. In fairness, thats a tough series of draws. Five of the defeats to Donegal came in an era when they were jostling in the pecking order behind Dublin. The same can be said for Tyrone. But Glenullin wouldve been fair from Ulster club contenders in , yet couldve dumped Dungiven out on their ear. A team with the McKeevers, Brolly, McGilligan, goalkeeper Eoin McCloskey and rising star Paul Murphy. As Derry go into this years Ulster championship, they search for a first win in the competition since  and there is a decent chance it will be Donegal again. From looking back at the championship records, it changes the attitude on where Derry currently sit. Yes, there is a lot of talent coming along, but there is nothing that breeds growth like winning games. And especially when against the odds. I think back to Castlebar in . After being relegated from Division  and shipping a hammering by Tyrone in Ulster, Derry were seconds away from turning Mayo over. Conor Loftus bagged a goal to change the game and Derry went out with a whimper after extra-time. Two years later, in the Ulster championship opener in Omagh, Derry had Tyrone momentarily on the ropes. But after Shane McGuigans goal, they needed to attack the jugular even more. Darren McCurry had the ball in the net a matter of seconds later, as Tyrone outscored Derry - to -. Then there was last years game with Armagh. If Derry had got anything out of the first ten minutes, when they were all at sea, theyd have had a brilliant chance of victory. Thats three games and three massive uses of the word , but thats where Derrys future lies. Speaking before the start of this season, manager Rory Gallagher highlighted how Derry, in recent years, failed to win games that mattered. He mentioned championship and key relegation or promotion games. The manner of both league wins so far point to a team that can have a real cut at the Ulster championship on the other side of battling for promotion. Derry need to replicate Dungiven from that night in Drumsurn, in the  championship. By hook or by crook, find a way of turning performances into results.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just over a year before his tragic and untimely death, Karl dragged Ballinascreen to the  title, overturning their U final defeat at the hands of Banagher two years earlier. The restructuring of the age grades, away from U, means the rescheduled  meeting of Lavey and Dungiven will be the last time a trophy will be presented in Karls honour. Karl proudly wearing his Ballinascreen colours. googletag.cmd.push Fittingly, Fridays showdown will be played at Ballinascreen, but his legacy wont end there. A banner placed prominently along the new walking track at Dean McGlinchey Park will keep his memory burning brightly. Either side of Karls photo are images of his Ballinascreen jerseys, football and hurling. His hurl and boots, as well as his distinctive helmet are also pictured. The generations that follow, those too young to remember his performances in the maroon and white, will be forever reminded of Karl. He epitomised sport. His jovial character made a team more than about training and games. On the flip-side, youd want him in your corner when the chips were down. googletag.cmd.push Step back in time. With seven minutes of the  U final remaining, Gavin ONeills penalty levelled matters and it was time for someone to stand up and be counted. Ballinascreen had that somebody. His name was Karl McAuley. After powering upfield, he laid the ball off to Carlus McWilliams and one pass later Dean Flanagan slotted the ball beyond goalkeeper Daryl McDermott for the game-defining goal. Ballinascreen captain on the day was Karls best friend Alastair Clerkin. They grew up a mile apart, were in the same class at the nearby Straw Primary School and soldiered together on the same football teams.     Ironically Alastairs son was born on the anniversary of Karls death. Alastair would place flowers on Karls grave and is still a close friend of the family. Shortly after Karls death, Alastairs mother Bernie left a statue at the grave of two warriors battling for a high ball, which inspired the design of the model handed out to the dozen who followed in Karls footsteps as Man of the Match. It helped Karls spirit stand the test of time. The Mid-Ulster Observers report described his  final midfield performance as a Tour de Force.  The Mid Ulster Observer match report from the  U Final The year after Karls death, Derry minors first trial was at Ballinascreen where had been tipped to play a starring role and nail down a place on the . There was an impeccable minute silence in the clubs hall before an army of nervous and excited trialists embarked on a morning of football. But for that minute, there wasnt a sound. And there will be a lump in every Ballinascreen throat on Friday night when the final U Man of the Match follows in Karls footsteps. He played around the middle for Ballinascreen teams, somewhere he could shape a game from. Those who knew him best, coached him and played alongside him tipped him for a long career. “Karl was brilliant that day,” Clerkin recalls of his box to box U final performance. “He was just everywhere and making things happen...he covered every blade of grass. “He wouldve been very consistent, but in that game, he was on a dferent level by his own standards. It was one of those games when he stood up and dragged the team with him.” It was fitting that Karls spadework made the dference, in the pressure cooker of the closing stages. Clerkin paid him the highest compliment, calling him a big game player. A championship man. Martin Boyle, who coached that U team with Mickey ONeill and Jerome Bradley, said how Karl, in his finest hour, simply dragged his side to victory by refusing to accept a defeat that was staring them in the face. Outside of the white heat of battle, Karl didnt take himself too serious. At training, many wouldve been on the receiving end of his jokes. Then, asflicking a switch, hed put his game face on and deliver by the bucketful, when it mattered. “He was there primarily for the craic and to enjoy himself and he was quite good at football as it happened,” Clerkin adds. “Hed still be playing with all the lads he grew up with...you miss the craic you wouldve had with him.” The banner to be erected at Dean McGlinchey Park.

The Kilrea team, led by James Kielt, who went through their entire club underage careers unbeaten overcame Ballinascreen in the  Feacuteile final. “He was our best player that day at corner back and he was a year young,” Boyle remembers. Boyle is now the Derry minor manager, a team that includes Matthew Downey and Dan Higgins, the last two winners of the U final Man of the Match. “I told them just how special an award it is as Karl was such a special person and sportsman.” Like Clerkin, Boyle echoed Karls off the pitch qualities. “Karl made a lasting impression on everyone fortunate enough to come into contact with him,” Boyle said. “In a team environment he was a dream, brilliant for morale and craic among lads.” At school, he played on St Colms U Derry championship winning team of , their first in many years. When asked for a memory of Karl McAuley, their coach Ciaran Meenagh looked back on their Ulster clash with St Pauls Bessbrook. St Colms were leading by two points, as the game ticked into the last  minutes in a foggy winter afternoon. After an off the ball incident, the game  boiled over. Meenagh points to it as a scary moment for a typical  year-old. But not Karl, who won the hop ball, kicked two late points and alongside Anton Kelly, the pair stemmed the tide. “It was just indicative of his character and his backbone,” Meenagh states. “He was tough and had a savage temperament...he would have gone far...I’m sure of that. “He was just a super lad altogether, what a character. He had a brilliant heart on the field of play.” The McAuley family will feel Karls loss more than anyone. Theyll miss him every day. But, tucked amongst those emotions, they can take strength from how he rubbed off on others. Those who competed with and against him on the playing fields of Derry and beyond held him in the highest regard. Its fitting the last piece of the history from the Derry U football championship will be the presentation of Karls award, the final Tour de Force. Thats his legacy. He will never be forgotten.

The SDLPs spokesperson for the economy and energy was speaking after the DUP obstructed a number of North-South ministerial meetings from proceeding. She said: “Ministers don’t get to take a pick and mix approach to their legal obligations - whether it’s North - South or East - West or in the Executive. All Ministers have to do our jobs and work in the interests of all our citizens. “For months now, elements within the DUP have purposely obstructed North - South meetings. The North South Ministerial Council is a requirement under the Good Friday Agreement and those in the DUP who say they believe in power sharing and devolution don’t get to pick and choose which parts of the agreement they implement. googletag.cmd.push “With a change in DUP leadership this week, there needs to be a change of approach from Edwin Poots. Even Edwin Poots has to face up to his legal responsibilities. The SDLP will not accept the DUP preventing these meetings that are crucial for agreement to be reached between Ministers in the North and the South on all island projects. That is why our Minister, SDLP Minister Nichola Mallon has written to the Attorney General for legal advice. No one, not Edwin, not the DUP, gets to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement on the SDLP’s watch.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In addition to facilitating large vans, cars and small vans can also be booked via the online system for the Glendermott Road and Eglinton recycling facilities.

The popular entertainer has been at the forefront of local efforts in helping vulnerable people during the crisis. Micky was invited to the Guildhall this week by Mayor Brian Tierney where he was presented with a special gt to recognise his work during the pandemic. It is the latest award for the local man. Micky also recently won a Spirit of Northern Ireland Award which recognised people who have helped other people during the last year. Micky said he was in total shock to find out about the award, but said he would be accepting it for the people of Derry. googletag.cmd.push In an interview with the Derry News last year, Micky spoke emotionally about the impact that the coronavirus crisis has had on him. When people started asking me for help I felt so emotional. It was so sad, he said. It was often at night when people had maybe had a drink and it gave them the courage to get intouch. They were so embarrassed to ask for help but I said look, this is between me and you. They put their trust in me. No one ever needs to know who got help. I will take that to my grave. googletag.cmd.push I swore to them over my mother and fathers grave that I would never speak about giving them the money. People from all over Derry got help from Donemana, from Eglinton. Nobody went without.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

So far, they have contributed pound, to the project which has allowed us to go the extra mile with more extensive resources and a very high spec finish in the ious areas.He said that the welcome garden was created almost exclusively by volunteers such as grandparent Stephen Vaughan, who built the planter boxes, the garden furniture was designed and constructed by brothers Lawrence and Gareth Blaney, the circular stone planter built by parent Fergus Rooney , grounds work was carried out by Pascal Magee and planting by Bill Carew. Plants and shrubs were provided at a discounted rate from Cunningham Flowers in Dundrum.The schoolrsquos head of outdoor education, Sean McReynolds, oversaw the project with building supervisors Brian Tweedie and Bill Carew, classroom assistant Ryan Craig and Gemma Vaughan, the schoolrsquos eco co-ordinator.Parent Roisin McKenna, who along with Andrea McMenamin, Natasha Shields and Rosaleen Cunlfe leads the PTFA committee, said that they had enjoyed ldquoamazing support from parents, the wider school community and local businesses.Roisin said: ldquoThe ethos of our PTFA is about \"making memories\" and this is always at the forefront of our fundraising. We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...Both are highly intelligent but maverick figures.Since Mr Johnson was mayor of London, he has known that he is a very popular public figure, and his political demeanour has always been arrogant, even swaggering.His boast last March that he would shake hands with people, after this had been shown to be a method of spreading Covid, was a case of cockiness tipping into recklessness.It was one of a string of pronouncements that suggested a cavalier attitude to a pandemic that, weeks later, would almost kill Mr Johnson.The Downing Street response to Covid will one day be examined in a public inquiry, but there is little doubt that the UK was one of the worse performing European countries, for reasons that are not as yet widely agreed.At the top of government sat a dysal duo. Mr Johnson had met his match in Mr Cummings, who is a brilliant organiser and campaigner and thinker. His belief in overthrowing systems of governance was not of itself an unreasonable one, given the huge inefficiencies of complacent bureaucracies. The problem was that it was never clear who or what would be the next casualty, as Northern Ireland found.EvenMr Cummings never said, as claimed, that he hoped NI would disappear into the Irish Sea, we do know for sure that Mr Johnson came to Belfast to give a pledge to the DUP about never accepting an Irish Sea border but did just that a year later as soon as he had the keys to Downing Street.Mr Cummings’ evidence yesterday should be treated with caution, because he has a grudge. Yet much of it rings true.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMore than  local people are urging the Cardf and Vale University Health Boardto build a health centre on Eagleswell Road, where a former primary school closed in .The disused plot of land is currently owned by Vale of Glamorgan council, and is allocated for  potential houses in the local development plan.But campaigners want the council to allow the health board to build a new health centre there, complaining the townrsquos current surgeries arenrsquot up to scratch.Councillor Gwyn John, of the Llantwit First Independent party, is organising the petition. He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered. This will likely see three lsquohealth and wellbeing centresrsquo with services like x-rays, out-of-hours GPs, community mental health teams, and ambulatory care.MORE NEWS:The health board is also planning nine lsquowellbeing hubsrsquo, either developing existing places like health centres, leisure centres or libraries or in new buildings such as Maelfa in Cardf. These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme. Under the local development plan, it would be used to meet the housing needs of those on the councilrsquos waiting list. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
