The drum major is poised to parade in his final Trooping the Colour on a day which will also mark the end of his four-decade career in the British Army (pictured outside the Officers Mess in Munster, 1986)Drum Major Staite also leads one of the massed bands during the parade in slow and quick time - something the father-of-two agreed very few people get to do.\u0027A lot of people tell you it is great to march behind a band, but you can\u0027t beat marching in front of it,\u0027 he said.During his career Drum Major Staite said he has visited 40 of the 50 states in America, and has worked in Kenya, Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.It was during a posting to West Berlin on his first deployment that he also patrolled the Berlin Wall and guarded Adolf Hitler\u0027s deputy, Rudolf Hess, when he was held at Spandau prison.Quizzed on what that experience was like, Drum Major Staite who plans on retiring to Middlesbrough with his wife Fee, said: \u0027You just sat in a sanger at Spandau prison.\u0027You weren\u0027t really allowed to look into the yard, it was just a normal prison with one person in it. But driving around the Berlin wall in those days was something very, very different.\u0027Posted to Household Division headquarters in 2000, he was involved in the funeral of the Queen Mother and Lady Margaret Thatcher, the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games and the royal weddings of Prince Charles and Prince William.June 9 will mark 38 years 355 days in uniform for Drum Major Staite, who described his impending last Trooping the Colour as a \u0027very special moment\u0027.He has also chosen the march the Grenadier Guards will step on to Horse Guards to, which is Wadi Al Batin - a battle honour from the 1991 Gulf War - in which he fought.\u0027Marching on to parade with the band playing Wadi al Batin for me, which is the march I chose, that will be quite emotional,\u0027 he added.Once the parade is finished Drum Major Staite said his state clothing will have to be handed back, something he said he will probably do \u0027with a tear in my eye\u0027.   Turban-wearing Coldstream Guards soldier will make history at Trooping the Colour as the first soldier to parade in Sikh headdress A Coldstream Guards soldier who will wear a turban as he parades during Trooping the Colour has said he hopes it is looked upon as a \u0027new change in history\u0027.More than 1,000 soldiers will take part in the ceremony which marks the Queen\u0027s official birthday on Saturday as the nation honours the monarch.For Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall the event is not only his first Trooping the Colour, but also marks the first time a member of the Coldstream Guards has taken part wearing a turban.The 22-year-old from Leicester told the said: \u0027I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history.\u0027I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the Army.\u0027A member of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, the turban he will be wearing during Trooping the Colour will be black, featuring the ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats.Sikh Coldstream Guard becomes the FIRST soldier to wear a...Prince Harry\u0027s stepbrother and stepsister revealed after...Former head of British forces Field Marshal Guthrie, 79, is...It\u0027s hardly Royal Ascot!

But hands off, girls, the hausfrau’s favourite is married... to a woman who was named the country’s top WAG. Hummels, 32 – who has also been named one of football’s best-dressed players off the field – married Cathy Fischer in 2015 in a relatively modest ceremony in Munich, where he plays in defence for Bayern Munich. The couple had their first child in January and Cathy now has her own successful ‘mummy blog’ where she shares her tips for happiness.

Monsieur Giroud cites David Beckham as his style icon. He’s got the well-manicured hair and tattoos to match. The 31-year-old Chelsea striker is also the face of a Hugo Boss fragrance and has his own calendar.

Recently he launched his own CR7 brand which flogs everything from boxer shorts – skimpy and tight with ‘Cristiano’ emblazoned on the waistband – to hotel rooms (footballing hunks not included). And, in case he ever gets fed up of admiring himself, he has a mini-me: his son, immodestly also called Cristiano Ronaldo.            Russian President Vladimir Putin has spent billions on the World Cup because he knows the world’s biggest sporting tournament will make the world come to himTHE BIG GAME\u0027S IN THE KREMLINRussia has become an international pariah following its meddling in Western elections, its backing for Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, its invasion of Ukraine and the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has spent billions on the World Cup because he knows the world’s biggest sporting tournament will make the world come to him. Expect Russia’s longest-serving leader since Stalin to bask in the attention he craves. And to use the expensive spectacle to increase his standing among his own people.   ULTRA-TERRIFYINGRussia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new level. While England’s thugs are typically tattooed, overweight, beery louts, the ultra-tattooed, ultra-gym-honed Ultras release YouTube videos of their fighting camps in the Russian forests and have threatened to unleash mayhem at the World Cup – with English fans their prime target.           Russia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new levelThey have been linked to white supremacists, and in Kiev last year some of the thugs sported Vladimir Putin masks marked with swastikas. They are a good deal more fearsome than the ageing Russian players they ‘support’. Perhaps its a good job that Prince William and other notable dignitaries have shown this year’s World Cup the red card.  CHEER UP, COMRADE Russians who work on the railways and the Moscow Metro have been given lessons in how to smile as they prepare to welcome international football fans. Their teacher Elnara Mustafina said: ‘Russian people don’t usually smile. That’s why, when other people come to Russia, they think Russians are not friendly.’ But not everything warrants a smile: 6,000 volunteers have been given an English-Russian phrasebook with entries including, ‘He got in a fight and now he’s unconscious’ and, ‘We need to stop the bleeding.’   HAVE WE GOT A HOPE?As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreams. But there is hope in the form of Harry Kane, one of the squad’s youngest ever captains.           As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreamsThe Spurs striker, 24, will lead one England’s most youthful ever World Cup squads, which includes Marcus Rashford, 20, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, 19. However, expectations – perhaps wisely – are muted for coach Gareth Southgate’s team. William Hill give them odds of 16-1 to win.  LEARN THE LINGOHere are some Russian phrases England fans might need in the coming weeks. ‘I bolen, kak popugai’ is ‘sick as a parrot’. ‘Nu kto tak igraet…!’ means ‘Who the hell plays this badly?’ ‘Get some glasses, ref’ is ‘Vozmi ochki, sudya’ while the locals like to shout: ‘Sudyu na mylo’.... which apparently means they want to make soap out of the ref. If Harry Kane misses a sitter, it’s a simple ‘Mazila’ and if there’s a bad pass, it’s ‘Kozel, ty kuda podaesh?’ ‘It’s a game of two halves’ is ‘podozhdem do kontsa igry’, literally ‘wait till the end of the game’. And ‘Naves’ means ‘on me ’ead, son.’   WE GET GARY, THEY GET HER!The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led, as always, by jug-eared crisp salesman Gary Lineker. But Russians get former beauty queen Victoria Lopyreva, the official ambassador of the tournament.   The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led by Gary Lineker - but Russians get former beauty queen Victoria LopyrevaShe will be presenting the coverage for leading broadcaster Channel One as well as interviewing the players, who will doubtless be queuing up to share their views. Victoria, 34, is a model, actress and reality TV star who was named Miss Russia in 2003, and is now one of the country’s best-known TV hosts.   PARTY LIKE A RUSSIAN  When in Russia, drink lots of vodka. For nibbles, why not indulge in traditional blinis and caviarWhen in Russia (or watching from home) why not do what the Russians do? Drink lots of vodka. While the oligarchs will be sipping Billionaire Vodka, which costs £2.8 million per six-litre diamond-studded bottle, Chase vodkas offer an English alternative, made in Herefordshire and costing a more modest £40 a time. It’s available in flavours including marmalade and elderflower.

Since leaving the Army in 2015, the Prince has focused his work on the creation of the Invictus Games and Heads Together, a campaign which seeks to challenge the stigma of mental health problems.A Kensington Palace source said: ‘Harry follows these issues closely and is always keen to get information from a variety of sources.’Welcoming the Prince’s intervention, CSgt Coult, a father of one from Suffolk, promised to launch a fact-finding mission on his behalf.‘I’m delighted that Prince Harry has shown an interest at such a critical time,’ he said. ‘The number of deaths among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans this year is utterly shocking and an indictment of the failure of the Government and military charities to meet their needs.          Died at the age of 35: Christopher Butcher, with wife Laura, was diagnosed with PTSD and died last yearThe MoD doesn’t want to know how many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are killing themselves, that’s why it doesn’t collate the information itself.’The spate of suspected suicides began with Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt, 39, of the Royal Engineers, who was found hanged on January 2. His death inspired our campaign which led to the MoD setting up the Helpline For Heroes in February.It has since received hundreds of calls from troops suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. Before our campaign, officials argued such a helpline would attract 50 calls a year at most.Welcoming Harry’s involvement, Nathan’s father Derek Hunt said: ‘He knows what it is like emotionally to serve on the front line. He cares. It is a shocking reflection of the Government that there have been so many suicides among young veterans this year.’Harry served with WO Hunt in Afghanistan in early 2008 as part of a desert reconnaissance unit. Following his death, the Prince expressed his heartfelt condolences to his family. The son of former England football captain Terry Butcher, Army captain Christopher Butcher, served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was found dead aged 35 at his parents’ home last October following a battle with PTSD.

During those 2,974 days, 138 soldiers were killed in hostile action. Following the 911 attacks in 2001, UK operations in Afghanistan started in October 2001. British troops marked the end of operations by handing over Camp Bastion on October 27, 2014. By then, there had been 405 deaths in hostile action over 4,775 days.The MoD said: ‘Any suicide is a tragedy. Help is available for serving personnel and veterans through the 24-hour mental health helplines and we are spending more than £20 million a year on mental health services.’  We must ALL do more to help themComment by Lord Dannatt I am not surprised Prince Harry has expressed concern about this very serious issue. Anyone who has taken part in frontline operations, as the Prince has done, would feel the same way about an increase in suicides in the veteran community.I would also commend Colour Sergeant Trevor Coult, a soldier decorated for his gallantry in Iraq, for bringing this matter to the Prince’s attention.As with the death of Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt earlier this year, any suicide, particularly that of a relatively young veteran, is one too many.There are helplines for veterans and serving personnel now, the latter following a successful campaign by The Mail on Sunday.I would appeal to the families and friends of veterans who are struggling to encourage them to seek help or to inform service charities or their GPs themselves.Don’t leave it until it is too late.

or even spoken on the phone.Trump, who enjoys making deals, is negotiating one of the biggest of his presidency with his meeting with Kim.The US president will push for a North Korean nuclear accord, which if he gets it, would be a history-making agreement that Trump hopes will net him the Noble Peace Prize. Trump told reporters upon his arrival he felt ‘very good’ about his upcoming sit down with Kim.It is far from clear what kind of final agreement will come out of the meeting, which some in Washington D.C. would be little more than a photo op for Kim to brag about back home.Before he left for Singapore, Trump told reporters he would rely on his intuition to seize up Kim’s intentions.‘My touch, my feel — that’s what I do,’ he said.Kim, after building up his country\u0027s nuclear capacity, now seems to want to focus on its economy and breaking down the international sanctions that have disseminated it.           Kim Jong-un sits down for a chat with Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana in Singapore   The North Korean leader wore his signature dark Maoist suit for his first day in Singapore on Sunday          Officials gather for a meeting between Kim Jong-Un and Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday evening  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un headed to meet Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shortly after he landed at Changi Airport on Sunday          Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gestures towards the media as he meets with North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong-un          The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (left) met with Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shortly after his arrival          Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gestures to the North Korean leader during his visit to the Istana on Sunday          The black Mercedes Benz stretch limousine carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong-un makes its way to the Istana on Sunday          The official car carrying North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un leaves the Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, after his meeting with the Singaporean prime minister           Police stand outside the gates of the Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, ahead of the arrival of North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong-un  President Trump boards Air Force One at Canadian Forces Base Bagotville in Canada on Saturday as he departs for Singapore           Trump waves as he boards Air Force One before leaving Bagotville in Canada to travel to Singapore to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-unMeanwhile, reporters and photographers packed the pavements outside the St Regis hotel -

It does not give prices but the list price of a similar facility in New York is $35,000 a night.But who will pick up the bill for the North Koreans\u0027 stay has been the subject of much speculation.     The plane carrying North Korea\u0027s leader approaches to land at Changi International Airport in Singapore on Sunday          A large limousine with a North Korean flag could be seen surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows as it sped through the city\u0027s streets           North Korean security personnel run next to a motorcade carrying North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on Sunday          The motorcade carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrives at the St Regis hotel in Singapore, where he is staying          Police vehicles vehicles block an entrance outside the St. Regis Hotel in Singapore on Sunday ahead of the historic summit          Police inspect vehicles at a checkpoint at the back of the St Regis Hotel ahead of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u0027s arrival          An armed police officer guards the entrance of the international media centre in Sinagpore on Sunday          A man takes a photo of a police notice outside the St. Regis Hotel in Singapore.

It is linked to the city by a bridge and home to high-end resorts, golf courses and a large amusement park.But the macabre history of the island, which will become the venue of the historic summit on Tuesday, is less known.In the 18th century, when Singapore was a British colony, an unknown epidemic killed off most of its population of 60. Only two households survived.During World War II, the British used artillery forts and a battery on the island to unsuccessfully fend off a Japanese invasion, which transformed it into a prisoner-of-war camp.It\u0027s no wonder the island was known as Pulau Blakang Mati, which roughly translates as \u0027island of death from behind.\u0027In 1970, the island was renamed after a nationwide contest. Sentosa was subsequently developed as a resort and expanded on reclaimed land.          Technicians install a surveillance camera at the entrance of the five-star Capella Hotel on Sentosa island on SaturdayNevertheless, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u0027s prime minister from 1959 to 1990, used the island to hold long-term political prisoners who were often detained without trial. Chia Thye Poh, a former member of parliament, spent 23 years in jail and under loose house arrest there.He worked as a freelance translator for the island\u0027s management, before he was allowed to visit the mainland for a short time every day and set free.But these days, Sentosa is a popular resort island, with numerous beaches, hotels and restaurants, and attracts around 19 million visitors every year.                                                         Journalists and onlookers watch the motorcade carrying North Koran leader Kim Jong Un-un arriving at the St. Regis hotel ahead of the US-North Korea summit          Hundreds of Singaporeans lined the streets to capture images of their own of his black Mercedes Benz stretch limousine with tinted windows - not normally allowed in Singapore, even for the country\u0027s prime minister          Singapore police stand guard outside the St Regis hotel where the North Korean leader will stay with signs informing people that security checks will be taking place          A large limousine with a North Korean flag could then be seen surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows as it sped through the city\u0027s streets          Pedestrians walk in front of the luxurious St Regis Hotel in Singapore, where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is staying          Kim Jong-un impersonator Howard X (right) and Donald Trump impersonator Dennis Alan (left) pose for a photo making a fist bump as they make an appearance at the Bugis Junction shopping mall in Singapore on SaturdayKyle Yule attacker had videos of machete on his smartphoneFormer head of British forces Marshal Guthrie thrown from horseFox joins the crowds at Trooping the Colour ceremony for the QueenHarry, Meghan and Kate leave Palace for Trooping the ColourPeople take part to naked bike ride in Brighton for cyclist rightsFisherman reveals haul after finding a safe at bottom of lakeNicola Sturgeon on England in the FIFA World Cup 2018Dramatic moment two cars narrowly avoid head-on collision in BradfordCare home workers caught on spy camera refusing patient foodKyle Yule attacker had videos of machete on his smartphoneFormer head of British forces Marshal Guthrie thrown from horseFox joins the crowds at Trooping the Colour ceremony for the QueenHarry, Meghan and Kate leave Palace for Trooping the ColourPeople take part to naked bike ride in Brighton for cyclist rightsFisherman reveals haul after finding a safe at bottom of lakeNicola Sturgeon on England in the FIFA World Cup 2018Justin Trudeau told Trump he is fighting for Canadian interestDramatic moment two cars narrowly avoid head-on collision in Bradford    Officers patrol outside the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore, where US president Donald Trump will stay ahead of the summit          Security personnel stand guard outside the Valley Wing of the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore, ahead of Trump\u0027s arrival          Armed police officers patrol outside the Shangri-La hotel where Trump will stay ahead of the US-North Korea summit in Singapore          Armed police officers patrol outside the Shangri-La hotel where US President Donald Trump will stay ahead of the US-North Korea summit in Singapore          Armed officers stand guard outside the Shangri-La hotel in Singapore where Donald Trump is staying ahead of the summit          Police officers patrol the swimming pool at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore on Sunday ahead of the summit on TuesdayKim is set to meet with Trump on Tuesday in what\u0027s shaping up to be one of the most unusual summits in modern history. Despite the initial high stakes of a meeting meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-each-other meeting. But he boldly predicted \u0027great success\u0027 and said he\u0027d been preparing \u0027all his life\u0027 for the meeting.\u0027A long time ago, this could have been solved in a lot easier manner and a lot less dangerous manner. But it wasn\u0027t. So I\u0027ll solve it, and we\u0027ll get it done,\u0027 he said on Thursday.Trump said on Thursday that he didn\u0027t think he had to prepare very much for the summit and that \u0027it\u0027s about attitude.\u0027 But some US officials have questioned whether Trump was doing enough to get up to speed.But the 71-year-old reassured naysayers on Friday that he had \u0027been preparing all my life\u0027 for the showdown with Kim.  Trump told reporters in Canada on Saturday any agreement with Kim would be \u0027spur of the moment,\u0027 underscoring the uncertain outcome of the meeting.That came as Trump threw the Group of Seven\u0027s efforts to show a united front into disarray after he became angry with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and said he might double down on import tariffs by hitting the sensitive auto industry.Trump\u0027s bombshell announcement that he was backing out of the G7 communique, made after he left the summit in Canada early, torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on the trade dispute between Washington and its top allies.Trump has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korea War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.  Trump departed the G7 summit in Charlevoix in Canada early, telling reporters he was embarking on a \u0027mission of peace.\u0027 He said: \u0027I will be on a mission of peace and will carry in my heart the hearts of millions of people, all over the world. \u0027We really think North Korea will be a tremendous place in a very short period of time and we appreciate everything that\u0027s going on.\u0027           Bystanders take photos of the limousine carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, ahead of the US-North Korea summit          A crowd of spectators gathers outside the Istana Presidential Palace, where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will arrive          Singapore police officers work to keep a crowd of onlookers behind barriers outside the Istana Presidential Palace on Sunday          A line of police cars arrive at the Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, ahead of a scheduled meeting between the Singaporean prime minister and North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong-unHe added to reporters: \u0027It\u0027s unknown territory in the truest sense, but I really feel confident. \u0027I feel that Kim Jong-un wants to do something great for his people and he has that opportunity and he won\u0027t have that opportunity again.\u0027It\u0027s never been done before. And obviously, what has been done before hasn\u0027t worked.\u0027Raising expectations, Trump had also said the outcome of the meeting will rely heavily on his own instincts.  The US president said he will know \u0027within the first minute\u0027 of meeting Kim whether the North Korean leader is serious about the nuclear negotiations. Trump frequently has boasted of his negotiating prowess as a former real estate developer, and his ability to read people, even though his businesses have declared multiple bankruptcies. \u0027I think I\u0027ll know pretty quickly whether or not, in my opinion, something positive will happen. And if I think it won\u0027t happen, I\u0027m not going to waste my time. I don\u0027t want to waste his time,\u0027 he said.\u0027This is a leader who really is an unknown personality,\u0027 Trump added of Kim.            Singapore military personnel patrol in front of the gate of the Istana Presidential Palace, where North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will meet on Sunday          The North Korean leader is scheduled  with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ahead of Tuesday\u0027s historic summit          Security gather outside the gates of the Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, ahead of a scheduled meeting between the Singaporean prime minister and Kim          Singapore police officers gather in front of the gate of the Istana Presidential Palace, where  Kim Jong-un is scheduled to arrive          Protest signs, including one calling for Trump\u0027s impeachment, are laid out for a \u0027Peace Gathering\u0027 at Hong Lim Park in Singapore on Sunday\u0027People don\u0027t know much about him. I think that he\u0027s going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside.\u0027White House aides described Trump in the days after receiving Kim\u0027s initial invitation as being obsessed by visions of winning the Nobel Peace Prize and using `The Art of the Deal\u0027 to put his mark on the global order. But in recent weeks, Trump\u0027s enthusiasm has been tempered somewhat by the challenge of deal-making with such an unpredictable opponent. And there are worries from the White House to East Asian allies that Trump\u0027s desire for an agreement will lead him to accept any deal - even if it\u0027s a bad one.The Trump-Kim meeting has captured intense global attention after a turn to diplomacy in recent months replaced, for the time being, serious fears of war last year amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests. The North, many experts believe, stands on the brink of being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles.          North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is driven in car with flags flying as the motorcade heads out of Singapore\u0027s Changi Airport           The Trump-Kim meeting has captured global attention after a turn to diplomacy  replaced serious fears of war last year          Kim is set to meet with Trump on Tuesday in what\u0027s shaping up to be one of the most unusual summits in modern history           Singapore police on guard outside the St Regis hotel, where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will stay ahead of the summitWhile there\u0027s deep skepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there\u0027s also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the U.S. and the North.The North Korean autocrat\u0027s every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists up until he shakes hands with Trump. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his despot father\u0027s death in late 2011 - twice traveling to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea respectively.  There\u0027s a flurry of speculation about what results might come from the summit. The initial goal was the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the North. Pyongyang has said it\u0027s willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with a reliable security assurance and other benefits. But many, if not all analysts, say that this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to his unchecked power.            North Korean security personnel arrive at the St Regis hotel ahead of his expected arrival of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un          Members of the North Korean delegation are seen in Singapore on Sunday ahead of the summit between Trump and Kim           The North Korean autocrat\u0027s every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists up until he shakes hands with Trump. Pictured, members of the North Korean delegation          Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are scheduled to meet at the Capella Hotel in Sentosa for a historic summit. Pictured, Singapore policeAny nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea\u0027s willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country\u0027s warheads and radioactive materials, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea\u0027s reluctance to open its doors to outsiders.But one result of the summit could be the opening of a McDonald\u0027s in North Korea as a reward and security guarantee for cutting back its nuclear ambitions. Chung-in Moon, a special adviser to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, recently revealed that North Korea wants American investments to deliver a boost to the nation\u0027s economy. Officials from Kim\u0027s regime said they would view American investments as a vital guarantee to their country\u0027s security at a dinner that followed the recent historic summit between Kim and Moon.Chung-in suggested the fast food chain - a symbol of American culture and power - and a Trump hotel could be businesses that open in Pyongchang.Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea.

Some people have seen it, guests that have been here and have asked, \u0027Why is this on the front of a Baptist Church?\u0027\u0027In a letter to the artist Delbert Baker Jr., Wright wrote that the statue and reliefs bring into question \u0027the theology and core values\u0027 of the church.\u0027We understand that this is not a Catholic icon, however, people perceive it in these terms,\u0027 the letter read.Religions have been ided over religious iconography for more than 500 years as artists adorned buildings with elaborate stained glass windows, paintings, and statues, said David Fink, assistant professor of religion at Furman University.There are noticeable physical similarities in the Red Bank church\u0027s statue and the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, historically one of the most Catholic countries in the world, Fink said.\u0027One-of-a-kind\u0027 sculpture of the head of a biblical king who...Is it a miracle?

They may just want to be a little more clear in their branding.\u0027Wright said his church about 20 miles west of Columbia in one of the most conservative parts of the state just wants to move forward and find a home for the statue and reliefs.\u0027I don\u0027t have any animosity against the Catholic denomination at all or the people that are fussing about this,\u0027 Wright said. \u0027The statue has served its season.

Some suggest it started with the mass production of plastics which now intermingle with rocks in the ocean bed.In The Human Planet Lewis and Maslin suggest the dawn of colonialism as the advent of the Anthropocene.They argue that 1610 was the true start.          The arrival of Europeans in the Americas triggered the Anthropocene, the book says. Pictured: Fur traders in Canada\u0027The arrival of Europeans, in particular the British and Spanish, had a profound impact on central and southern America,\u0027 Maslin told the Observer.Settlers and soldiers carried European diseases like smallpox, measles, typhoid and the flu.These killed as many as 50 million Americans who has no resistance to their foreign illnesses.With the death of so many of the continents native people forests began to regrow where farmland had once been tended to.By using carbon dioxide readings from the period they calculated that by 1610 forests had reclaimed much of the continent.Forests are more effective at absorbing carbon dioxide than crops and therefore the reforestation of farmland would have led to a drop in carbon dioxide.          At least 50 million Americans were killed during the colonisation of the Americas. Pictured: A market in the West IndesRats and other pests carried on ships across the Atlantic had a stark effect on local species.\u0027A good example is provided by the earthworm. In the US, most of the earthworms you will find there are actually European, said Maslin.\u0027They are better at competing for nutrients. So they have taken over the soil in North America since Europeans brought them across the Atlantic in the 16th century. That is not something you can unpick. They are there for good.\u0027In turn America\u0027s own produce changed the terrain of other continents. In just decades Europeans were eating potatoes and tomatoes while Chinese and Indian cuisine has absorbed the heat of the American pepper.In China newly imported maize was planted in lands previously thought too dry to be farmed.This led to more deforestation and population increase.With the pace of technological advancement only increasing it appears the Anthropocene is here to stay.Predicting its course is difficult, the authors admit.

A birth is considered premature if the baby is born before 37 weeks – three weeks before a normal delivery at 40 weeks.Although premature births are relatively common, little is known about why they occur and how they can be prevented.Babies born prematurely are much more likely to have breathing complications and heart problems, and the risk increases the earlier they are born.One theory as to why women go into labour prematurely is that they are suffering from an infection which causes their womb to become inflamed and contract. Only last week scientists in the US revealed that they had developed a blood test that can identify women at risk of inflammation using their genes.A modern lullaby!

Researchers hope to offer it to women at risk of premature birth during routine scans at 12 and 20 weeks.Those at risk include women who have had premature births before or a miscarriage in the second trimester, and those who have an abnormally short cervix, which protects the womb from infection.It is hoped all women will soon be offered the test during routine scans in order to prevent premature births and save lives.Lead researcher Dr David MacIntyre said: ‘At this stage we’re in early development with the test but we’re really excited about the potential it holds.’The test takes a sample of cells from inside the vagina which are then analysed by a small machine to give a result in three minutes.           There are around 60,000 babies born prematurely each year – or about one in 12 of all deliveriesIf there are high numbers of potentially harmful bacteria such as staphylococcus and streptococcus then women may need to be offered antibiotics.The scientists hope to screen women at regular intervals during pregnancy as the make-up of bacteria can change within weeks.They do not know how much the test will cost but hope it will be affordable so it can be routinely used in NHS hospitals.But regardless of the cost, researchers say it could ultimately save millions of pounds in care for premature babies.Caroline Lee-Davey, chief executive of Bliss, the charity for premature and sick babies, said: ‘We welcomes all research which helps us to understand and prevent premature birth.‘The average cost to the NHS of a day of neonatal care is £805 – and of course being born premature also has a significant long-term impact on babies and families.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1CDDCB00000578-0-image-a-83_1528662740947.jpg","title":"Shocking photos reveal Syrian refugee children young six working streets Lebanon","story":"    Brothers aged 13 and 15, originally from Damascus, have worked in a stone quarry in northern Bekaa for the past two years          The siblings (pictured) work eight and half hours a day in the city. There are thought to be at least 180,000 children working across the Middle Eastern country          Syrian refugee children begging at the sides of busy roads in Beirut, Lebanon.

One 14-year-old who works on a farm picking olives, sprays pesticides without protective gear. He told the IRC, ‘I put a scarf around my mouth to protect myself from the chemicals. \u0027The first time I did this it caused a rash on my skin. It’s become normal to me now. I can’t refuse to do it otherwise they won’t pay.’Another youngster, 10, picks tobacco along with her mother and siblings. ‘I hate working,’ she said. ‘Picking tobacco is the worst. \u0027Before we were given gloves to wear, we would use our bare-hands to pick the tobacco leaves. It would give us a rash and make our eyes red. We use a sharp needle to sew the tobacco leaves. I often cut my fingers.’ The IRC is a nongovernmental organisation which offers emergency aid and long-term assistance to refugees. Former head of British forces Marshal Guthrie thrown from horseFox joins the crowds at Trooping the Colour ceremony for the QueenHarry, Meghan and Kate leave Palace for Trooping the ColourKyle Yule attacker had videos of machete on his smartphonePeople take part to naked bike ride in Brighton for cyclist rightsFisherman reveals haul after finding a safe at bottom of lakeNicola Sturgeon on England in the FIFA World Cup 2018Dramatic moment two cars narrowly avoid head-on collision in BradfordCare home workers caught on spy camera refusing patient food    An IRC survey found more than half of Syrian working children were using dangerous tools or regularly exposed to hazardous substances, which on farms can include pesticides or tobacco plants          Aged between 8 and 12, these children sell CDs on Tripoliís waterfront.

The fact that children were involved was also a factor.Lord Mance also told The Sunday Telegraph judges are immune from attempts to influence them over the internet, adding: \u0027We are trained not to be influenced.\u0027If people started to believe as a result of trolling or media that judges were doing just what they liked and giving effect to their personal preferences rather than applying the hallowed system of common law and statute law honestly and diligently... they would be very mistaken.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/01/4D18330300000578-0-image-m-30_1528591969138.jpg","title":"Theresa clamp Remoaner MPs tries unite Conservative party","story":"    Defiant Theresa May will urge rebels to send a message of unity to the countryMrs May will tell them: \u0027We must be clear that we are united as a party in our determination to deliver on the decision made by the British people.\u0027It comes on the eve of two days of high-stakes debates in the House of Commons.In an unprecedented show of unity, former Cabinet Ministers Amber Rudd and Iain Duncan Smith told pro-EU backbenchers to \u0027march in lockstep\u0027 or risk opening the door for Jeremy Corbyn.Theresa May squares up to rebel MPs ahead of key Brexit...I use chemicals?

And to use the expensive spectacle to increase his standing among his own people.   ULTRA-TERRIFYINGRussia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new level. While England’s thugs are typically tattooed, overweight, beery louts, the ultra-tattooed, ultra-gym-honed Ultras release YouTube videos of their fighting camps in the Russian forests and have threatened to unleash mayhem at the World Cup – with English fans their prime target.           Russia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new levelThey have been linked to white supremacists, and in Kiev last year some of the thugs sported Vladimir Putin masks marked with swastikas. They are a good deal more fearsome than the ageing Russian players they ‘support’. Perhaps its a good job that Prince William and other notable dignitaries have shown this year’s World Cup the red card.  CHEER UP, COMRADE Russians who work on the railways and the Moscow Metro have been given lessons in how to smile as they prepare to welcome international football fans. Their teacher Elnara Mustafina said: ‘Russian people don’t usually smile. That’s why, when other people come to Russia, they think Russians are not friendly.’ But not everything warrants a smile: 6,000 volunteers have been given an English-Russian phrasebook with entries including, ‘He got in a fight and now he’s unconscious’ and, ‘We need to stop the bleeding.’   HAVE WE GOT A HOPE?As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreams. But there is hope in the form of Harry Kane, one of the squad’s youngest ever captains.           As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreamsThe Spurs striker, 24, will lead one England’s most youthful ever World Cup squads, which includes Marcus Rashford, 20, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, 19. However, expectations – perhaps wisely – are muted for coach Gareth Southgate’s team. William Hill give them odds of 16-1 to win.  LEARN THE LINGOHere are some Russian phrases England fans might need in the coming weeks. ‘I bolen, kak popugai’ is ‘sick as a parrot’. ‘Nu kto tak igraet…!’ means ‘Who the hell plays this badly?’ ‘Get some glasses, ref’ is ‘Vozmi ochki, sudya’ while the locals like to shout: ‘Sudyu na mylo’.... which apparently means they want to make soap out of the ref. If Harry Kane misses a sitter, it’s a simple ‘Mazila’ and if there’s a bad pass, it’s ‘Kozel, ty kuda podaesh?’ ‘It’s a game of two halves’ is ‘podozhdem do kontsa igry’, literally ‘wait till the end of the game’. And ‘Naves’ means ‘on me ’ead, son.’   WE GET GARY, THEY GET HER!The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led, as always, by jug-eared crisp salesman Gary Lineker. But Russians get former beauty queen Victoria Lopyreva, the official ambassador of the tournament.   The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led by Gary Lineker - but Russians get former beauty queen Victoria LopyrevaShe will be presenting the coverage for leading broadcaster Channel One as well as interviewing the players, who will doubtless be queuing up to share their views. Victoria, 34, is a model, actress and reality TV star who was named Miss Russia in 2003, and is now one of the country’s best-known TV hosts.   PARTY LIKE A RUSSIAN  When in Russia, drink lots of vodka. For nibbles, why not indulge in traditional blinis and caviarWhen in Russia (or watching from home) why not do what the Russians do? Drink lots of vodka. While the oligarchs will be sipping Billionaire Vodka, which costs £2.8 million per six-litre diamond-studded bottle, Chase vodkas offer an English alternative, made in Herefordshire and costing a more modest £40 a time. It’s available in flavours including marmalade and elderflower.

Beyond the jocular Twitter exchanges over nuclear war, the president and the supreme leader share a dearly held passion for outre architecture and flamboyant interiors.Kim’s taste is a more closely guarded secret. Even the locations of his many residences are shrouded in mystery. But hints can be gleaned from his ambition to “turn the whole country into a socialist fairyland”, as one of North Korea’s official patriotic slogans declares, and by the wave of startling structures that has been sweeping Pyongyang since he came to power.“Pyonghattan” was the joke nickname given by foreign diplomats to a cluster of shiny cylindrical towers that emerged in the capital in 2012, assuming this was a one-off publicity stunt. But since then, almost every year has seen the grand unveiling of another lavish trophy project, each more futuristic than the last, with parades of jaunty towers dressed in sci-fi costumes and crowned with cosmic symbols, worthy of scenes from The Jetsons.Future Science Street was well under construction when I visited Pyongyang in 2015 on an architectural tour – scenes from which are captured in a new book, out this month, which aims to provide a glimpse behind the closed doors of the famously secretive country. Armies of soldier-builders were racing to finish the new riverside district of 2,500 apartments for “scientists of the future” in time for the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers’ party. One tapering concrete shaft took the form of a steroidal pagoda, while bright orange and green tiles were being hastily applied to other curving towers, designed “in the shape of an intellectual’s calligraphy brush”, according to our guides.Colour is the most surprising thing about visiting North Korea. Where you might expect to find a drab Soviet-style world of crumbling concrete slabs and inflated Stalinist ministry buildings, Pyongyang instead unfolds as a pastel panorama. There are blocks in minty green and terracotta, mustard and ochre, as well as more recent apartment towers that look like sticks of seaside rock, clad with spiralling blue balconies. It is a hipster dream of turquoise and millennial pink.The pastel palette continues inside, where behind closed doors we would find interiors as unreal as stage sets, ordered with the eerie symmetry of a Wes Anderson movie. The Rungrado May Day stadium, built in 1989, had just been refurbished, replete with locker rooms, physio clinic and media centre decked out with synthetic vinyl surfaces in sugary colours, assembled with the crisp perfection of a Thomas Demand paper sculpture.Is was unlike anything I had seen before, but entirely in keeping with Korea’s official Juche ideology, which specifies that all architectural inspiration should come only from within and be uniquely Korean in its essence. “An architect who is convinced that his country and his things are the best will not look upon foreign things or try to copy them,” Kim Jong-il declared in his 1991 160-page treatise, On Architecture. Instead, he must “make tireless efforts to create architecture amenable to his\u0026nbsppeople”.The young Kim seems to have latched on to his father’s amenity principle. In an unlikely bid to boost tourism and cater to North Korea’s growing middle class, he is furnishing the country with a host of leisure facilities, from a new ski resort to plans for an underwater hotel. The capital now boasts a hi-tech shooting range, where visitors can take potshots at pheasants, as well as a new horse-riding centre, where children of the elite can have a taste of rural life for the equivalent of $5 an hour – around the average weekly wage of most North Koreans.When we departed Pyongyang for the border to the south, driven along a deserted pothole-riddled highway, past rusting pylons and ragged children playing on the street, it soon became clear that we had left a limited bubble of prosperity. It was evident that the candy colours and kindergarten kitsch are used as an architectural anaesthetic, the state’s saccharine salve to infantilise its people and numb them to the abject realities of everyday life in the Hermit Kingdom.• Inside North Korea by Oliver Wainwright is published on 22 June (Taschen, £40).

After endless delays, strikes and ticket-price hikes, as the latest crisis on the railways grinds on, the outgoing chief executive of Network Rail is made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, whatever that is. The secretary of state for transport faces calls for his resignation, but grimly stays put. And every day, the ongoing saga of Northern trains highlights not just the daily pain inflicted on thousands of travellers in the north-west and beyond, but the awful state of this country’s public transport.To recap: new timetables were meant to be introduced as part of a big drive to improve services. But, as with Govia Thameslink in the south-east, Northern – a franchise operated by Arriva, the multinational transport giant that is a subsidiary of Germany’s state-owned Deutsche Bahn – had not trained enough drivers. At the same time, Network Rail compounded the mess by allowing electrification work to overrun. An overlooked factor in the chaos is the legacy of something that happened six years ago, when Network Rail centralised its timetabling operations in Milton Keynes, and created a system that had far too little connection with realities on the ground. Such is yet another example of one of the\u0026nbspgreat ironies of recent history: that Thatcherite believers in the liberating wonders of markets have proved to be very good at creating byzantine, top-down, endlessly failing systems rather suggestive of the worst aspects of the old Soviet Union.Millions of us live with the consequences of this organised madness, not as a matter of sudden crises but an unending daily reality of delayed journeys, skyrocketing ticket prices, and inexplicable timetables. And all the time the pain is intensified by the sense that,\u0026nbspfar away, everything is being overseen by panicked\u0026nbsppeople who know far too little – something vividly demonstrated every time Chris “failing” Grayling\u0026nbspopens his mouth.I live in Frome, in Somerset, a growing town of 25,000 with a railway station that sits on a branch line that ends in Weymouth. It is basically a single track covered by a huge wooden shed, and is regularly unstaffed. Our trains are run by the Great Western Railway, formerly known as First Great Western, but renamed in an apparent attempt to make us avert our eyes from daily delays and think of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. If you want to travel the 100 miles to London at peak time, a return ticket bought on the\u0026nbspday will cost you £172.Bristol, by contrast, is 25 miles away Bath, 12. Lots of people here work in those cities, and travel to them for no end of leisure reasons. But our local transport services make no sense.During the working week there are three feasible morning rush-hour train services to Bristol, two of which leave before 7am, with an hour’s gap before a service that leaves just after eight o’clock. Each one takes around an hour – almost as long as it takes to drive. For the two hours up to 10.15am, there are no trains at all. To make things even more painful, as subsidies have been slashed, local bus provision has been hacked\u0026nbspdown. So the car remains king, and the town is\u0026nbspsubject to regular gridlock.The recurring theme was the fact that the railways tend to exist in a bubble, cut off not just from other aspects of transport policy but the voices of communities up and down the country. This is one of the reasons why those tweeted calls to renationalise the entirety of the train system that explode whenever something goes wrong have a tendency to sound glib. They offer some answer to the insane complexity and short-termism of our railways, for sure, but fail to get near two other crucial issues: the neglect of local needs, and the fact that trains are only one part of a much bigger problem.If you live in London, you will know about the benefits of an integrated transport system run by people with knowledge of the places they serve: thanks to Transport for London, it exists. North of the border, with strong caveats, similar things can be said about Transport for Scotland, and in particular its oversight of the ScotRail franchise in Wales, new devolved transport powers have triggered a plan for hugely improved train services and a new metro system for the South Wales valleys.In far too much of the UK, by contrast, trains remain a byword for delays and frustration, and the various strands of public transport are wildly unaligned, while most of the country suffers from a continuing failure to tie public transport policy into the everyday world it ought to serve. An example: can you imagine a housing development being built around a new train station, rather than more roads?The Department for Transport has serially refused to cede crucial powers over transport to decision-makers in the north, even when the case for doing so has been completely straightforward. An example: the Greater Manchester Combined Authority wants to take over 96 train stations and their surrounding land currently owned by Network Rail, so that it can spruce them up, get going on plans to put new houses and businesses close to train services, and give people a taste of a more efficient, eco-conscious future. But when presented with the plans last year, the department was reportedly noncommittal – and, according to a Mancunian insider I recently spoke to, responded with little more than an offer of “exploring partnership options”.“Far too little progress has been made,” he told me. In far-off London, I could make out a familiar sound: the man from the ministry, frantically trying to pull the rusting levers he so jealously guards, while trains carried on inexplicably pulling into sidings, buses remained locked in their depots, and, sighing, people got\u0026nbspback in their cars.• John Harris is a regular  contributor on subjects including politics, popular culture and music"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f666ab10569fa6709e49762d813c5e5acf09e79/0_162_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66219079761ce4733247983e57a264a3","title":"graduation selfies could lead to degree say experts","story":"Anti-fraud agency Hedd warns graduates not to post pictures of certificates on social mediaFreshly graduated students who take pictures with their new degrees are being urged not to share the images on social media, to avoid fuelling the multimillion-pound trade in fake degrees.

Sarah Wharton tries her hand at foraging, fossil hunting, hiking and stand-up paddleboardingStay over in StaithesThe eclectic personality of Staithes reflects residents past and present. In the jumble of tiny cottages that spill down a gorge to the harbour have lived James Cook (later Captain), who came to work in a grocer’s store, and the influential Staithes group, a 19th-century artists’ group. It’s home to the Staithes festival of arts and heritage in September, and is a shoo-in for basecamp on a trip that takes in culture, natural history and a yomp. Rest up at the Endeavour B\u0026ampB, where host David Linley is a walking encyclopedia of activities, and heritage tales. He makes a mean breakfast too: don’t miss the kippers from Staithes’ own smokehouse. For dinner, try the delicious crab salad at the Royal George – like all pubs in this fishing village that’s something of a sovereign state, it’s independent and family owned. And if food and flavours really are your thing, then book a day of coastal foraging and cooking tips with Taste the Wild, which runs courses out of Staithes. Co-founder Chris Bax says: “Foraging reflects the resurgence of ersity in food: we let people rediscover things we used to eat but have dropped out of fashion.” The Attenborough in all of us will want to get closer to wildlife in an area rich in flora and fauna from moor to sky to sea. Jump aboard a birdwatching and cetacean safari with ecologist Richard Baines at Yorkshire Coast Nature (YCN) and you might just see some minke whales. Or stay grounded and snap up a seabird photography workshop with YCN’s Steve Race. Find your waveStand-up paddleboarding is “surfing without the faff of having to get up while the wave is breaking all over you,” says Simon Palmer, explorer, who co-founded SUP Adventures with Dan Fawkes. Both have that ex-military knack of turning what should be a gruelling encounter – with messy sea, two left feet or black skies – into a fun escapade and day-long grin. “People love it because it’s so accessible, irrespective of ability. It’s a terrific confidence booster if you’re anxious about getting out to learn a new activity or getting in the water. And it’s an all-body workout too.” Conquer position, posture and paddling technique at postcard-pretty Sandsend or alongside Saltburn’s trim, elegant Victorian pier. Then treat yourself to a follow-up session to learn how to read wave conditions and ride on to the beach. For something more stretchy, try SUP Adventures’ river yoga. Determined to have a Point Break moment? Head for surf spots at Staithes, where the rock bottom breaks produce powerful and defined waves (experienced surfers only). Or dip a beginner’s toe at Whitby’s West Cliff beach with Whitby Surf School. Hike into natureIf watersports aren’t your thing, then hiking along this extravagantly handsome Jurassic coastline, creaking with 200m years of stories, puritanical Victorian glamour and fishing folklore, will definitely get your heart rate up. North Yorks Moors senior ranger Bernie McLinden offers some tips: “Hayburn Wyke is a fantastic place to get to,” he says, referring to a secretish cove at the southern end of the North York Moors national park. “I was there at 7pm last night and even spotted a couple of surfers: they seemed to be having a great time.” With a waterfall that plops on to the beach, it’s a fairytale scene to take in on a circular five-mile walk that goes south along the Cleveland Way and returns along part of the Cinder Track, a defunct 21-mile railway line from Whitby to Scarborough that’s great cycling too. Another inspiring journey is the “source-to-sea” hike that picks up the river Esk at Westerdale Moor and closes at Whitby’s harbour mouth. At 37 miles, the full walk takes three or four days, but the Esk Valley railway enables you to cheat and do a day’s chunk to suit. “You might be lucky enough to see an otter along the way,” McLinden says. “At Sleights, if it’s the right time of year, you can see salmon leap. And in springtime, the woodland areas across the park are just wonderful, brimming with the beauty of the bluebells, primroses and ramsons.” Back in Staithes, if you have just 15 minutes to spare you can sprint southwards then upwards on to the cliff and a new part of the England Coast Path, to get the best view of the waterside hamlet. If you have longer, plump for a four-mile circle, taking in the industrial ironstone past of Port Mulgrave. Paddle back in timeThe Dinosaur Coast has never been more alive than when kinetic geologist, marine biologist and sailor Peter McGrath is talking about the natural kingdom that surrounds smartly turned-out Runswick Bay. He says: “One of ‘my’ best finds in 40 years came from my daughter Ruby on one of her first fossiling trips. ‘I’ve found an ammonite,’ she shouted casually. Not just any ammonite! A rare 18cm Hilderocas bifrons is a very good find.” McGrath is on a mission to discover and photograph every fossilised and living thing he can in the area, and shares his vast expertise with interested visitors as part of local firm Barefoot Kayak’s fossil foray team. If McGrath is the vim in this expedition, topping up your knowledge of fossil poo and Devil’s toenails (coprolites and Gryphaea respectively), Barefoot Kayak’s founder, paddlesport guide and coastguard Andy Monaghan provides the calm – putting the newly waterborne at ease with a deceptively laid-back style that nails safety. Paddling along with the duo is relaxing and stimulating in equal measure. Sea kayaking is manageable for most people and great for independent travellers or family groups with a yen for adventure.

If that’s a qualified claim, that’s because Ryan Coogler’s impressively hungry, purposeful comic-book spectacular is still operating within a straitjacket, albeit one of chic, futuristic design: it’s stifled, particularly in a protracted, place-to-place first half, by the box-ticking rigours of in-house Marvel storytelling. When freed from the business of franchise-founding, however, it pounces, bounds and even, in less feline fashion, flies: its flashes of political conscience, no-nonsense gender parity and glimmering Afrofuturist aesthetic feel collectively new. Whatever its other compromises, Black Panther is a widest-possible-audience juggernaut that leads with its blackness rather than smuggling it through big-studio customs.How the film’s impact will shift or rearrange the identity politics of commercial Hollywood movie-making remains to be seen. In the meantime, we can hope its success encourages some crossover interest in the less moneyed black cinema that inspired it. Perhaps that’s optimistic, though either way curious viewers will have to do more digging in the streaming archives than they should to find substantial reserves of black-directed and black-oriented films. Take, for example, Touki Bouki, the raw, seductive, cooler-than-being-cool 1973 Senegalese road odyssey that arguably contributed a hair of DNA to Black Panther’s African heroism, and was visually quoted by Beyoncé in her most recent tour marketing: a genuinely iconic Afro classic, yet not streamable anywhere in the UK. (The US edition of FilmStruck has it here’s hoping ours catches up soon.)It may not stretch to Touki Bouki, but the BFI Player’s excellent Black Star collection, a still-growing offshoot from their 2016 cinema season of the same name, is the kind of library more specialist streaming outlets could stand to build. The brief is broad and so is the range: obviously indispensable US canon titles such as Do the Right Thing and Moonlight, cris de coeur from modern Africa such as Of Good Report and A Screaming Man, odd cultural artefacts such as Car Wash and For Queen and Country, starring Denzel Washington as an unlikely embodiment of 1980s London urban alienation. The underseen pick of the menu: Charles Burnett’s angry, on-edge, morally creased cop thriller The Glass Shield, which may have been made in 1994 but feels notably current in its examination of racial persecution by (and within) the police force.Those inclined to dig deeper still, meanwhile, might consider giving the little-heralded streaming service Kweli.TV a look. Billed as a curated collection of African diaspora content – including films, documentaries, TV and shorts from around the world – it’s a mixed but often revelatory bag. Given that it’s a US-based service, inconsistent international licensing can lead to some roadblocks: I was disappointed to find Raoul Peck’s sterling political biopic Lumumba barred in the UK, but had better luck with the genuinely bewitching, west African folk-inspired animation Kirikou and the Sorceress. Subscription fees (the conversion of $6 a month) are low enough to make such spottiness forgivable, though pay-per-view options are also available. It’s not as if you’ll find such fascinating nuggets as T’Ain’t Nobody’s Bizness, a half-hour short on lesbian blues goddesses of the 1920s, anywhere else. That’s a long way from Black Panther, but here’s to gates, and minds, opening.Roman J Israel, Esq (Sony, 12)Denzel Washington is at the legacy stage, where he’ll get Oscar-nominated for just about anything, including this unusually shaped, minor-key legal drama — but his turn as an awkward, idealistic defence attorney is among his most interestingly eccentric.The Defiant Ones No Way Out (Eureka, U15)A fine, straight-backed pair of early Hollywood civil rights inquiries, linked by the flinty star presence of Sidney Poitier: the former’s symbolically direct black-and-white convict study has endured more, but the latter, a film noir setting a black doctor against a racist patient, is perhaps riskier and more complex.Loveless  (Altitude, 15) Russia’s most muscular auteur, Andrey Zvyagintsev, follows Leviathan with another beautiful blunt instrument of where-are-we-now social critique: mapping the despairing fallout of a child’s disappearance, it’s vast and delicate, chilling and fire-breathing.

When the vote was taken in December 2010, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, famously arrived nonchalantly in Zurich to collect his prize and now the world will broadcast the greatest of sporting events from the country he rules absolutely.England in their bid spent £21m and an enthusiastic but ultimately hapless two years seeking votes from a 24-man Fifa executive committee since found to have contained 17 members found guilty or accused of corruption or ethics rule breaches. Criminal investigations have started in Switzerland, France and the US into the process by which a majority of those members voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup and for Russia to have the one starting on Thursday, after England’s entreaties received just two votes.Yet little progress of those investigations has been reported. Both victorious countries’ bid teams and political rulers have denied wrongdoing in the vote-seeking campaigns, got on with building the promised stadiums and infrastructure and prepared to host the world’s football nations and broadcasters.In an intriguing documentary, A World Cup of Spies, directed by the Danish film-makers Niels Borchert Holm and Jon Adelsten and recently broadcast on the ARTE TV channel, the chief executive of Russia’s organising committee, Alexey Sorokin, acknowledged the hope that the tournament will be good for Russia’s image.After a sequence in which another Russian official laughs that people think of Russians having a gun in one hand and a vodka in the other, Sorokin acknowledges: “There are still some stereotypes people live by. The World Cup I hope will mean a lot for the country, a chance for us to show a new democratic country and people that have created a lot of progress.”The World Cup has, of course, finally arrived with Russia’s image the very opposite of cleansed, particularly in England, following the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and the multiple hostilities and cyber-attacks of which Putin’s Russia stands accused. Fifa maintained Russia as the host throughout the revelations that its sports ministry had overseen a huge athlete doping programme, which led to the International Olympic Committee banning the country’s team from competing in the winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The sports minister at the time of the doping, Vitaly Mutko, since promoted to deputy prime minister, stepped down from his football roles in Russia and is no longer visible as the politician most associated with Fifa’s tournament.The ARTE documentary film-makers put to Sorokin the accusation long understood to be true by the England bid that Russia had officers from its secret service, the FSB, post-Communist successor to the KGB, spying on their activities. Sorokin laughed: “Honestly I don’t know what to say about it. I was never aware of any of their involvement certainly I was not the reason for any involvement of any intelligence service.”It is well-established, however, that the English FA did in fact employ intelligence operators itself, including the former MI6 officer in Russia, Christopher Steele, now known globally for his dossier on the US president Donald Trump’s activities in Russia. One well-placed source confirmed to the  that Steele was taken on eight months into the bid, when the English FA, confident in the country’s credentials and stock of stadiums, learned that Russia was a rival taking the opportunity very seriously.Given that Russia eclipsed England in the vote, and the lack of proven evidence of wrongdoing, it has never been clear how valuable the intelligence was. A report about some of it was published in 2014 by the House of Commons select committee for culture, media and sport, in a letter from the Sunday Times, whose reporters had talked to an “ex MI6 source,” understood to be Steele. The letter said that: “Putin was understood to have summoned a select group of oligarchs and tasked them with doing whatever was necessary to ensure the victory of the Russia 2018 bid, including striking personal deals with voters.”After Putin became properly engaged with the bid in February 2010, he did involve himself personally in it, and met several executive committee members, including some of the corrupt figures. That broke no rules. Every country’s senior politicians see World Cup hosting as a trophy and England’s bid advanced Britain’s then prime minister, David Cameron, and Prince William to press executive committee members’ flesh during the final claustrophobic days in Zurich.The Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, was publicly prominent as one of the oligarchs supporting the Russia bid – he was in the Zurich hall for the victory and can be seen in the television footage behind Sorokin, smiling and applauding.Of this alleged Russia operation the MI6 source was quoted as having told the reporters that “nothing was written down” and that it would all have been “deniable”.There were no firm allegations made against iniduals, except the letter reporting that sources had said a Picasso painting had been given to the then Uefa president, Michel Platini, and the Belgian executive committee member, Michel D’Hooghe, had been given a valuable artwork, later reported also to be a Picasso. Platini rejected that claim as “totally fictitious”. Fifa’s ethics committee investigation accepted D’Hooghe’s evidence that he had indeed been given a painting by Vyacheslav Koloskov, a lobbyist for the Russian bid, but that it was by an unknown artist, painted on cardboard, and worthless.The investigation, conducted by Fifa’s then deputy ethics committee chairman, the Swiss prosecutor Cornel Borbély, cleared Russia of any impropriety or rule breaches. Famously Borbély accepted that the bid had been conducted on borrowed computers – from a football foundation which “appeared to have been linked to Mr Roman Abramovich”. Borbély reported that the computers were returned to the football foundation after the bid was won, and then: “The owner has confirmed that the computers were destroyed.”Borbély noted he had not been given many documents and concluded that no wrongdoing by Russia’s bid had been substantiated. After the former FA chairman, Lord Triesman, had been exposed by a newspaper alleging collusion between Russia and Spain, Triesman had withdrawn that allegation and the FA officially apologised.In his acceptance speech in Zurich Putin said pointedly that it was a great honour which his country had won, after a “tight – and fair – fight”.The FA under its chairman, Greg Clarke, is understood to be keen to bid yet again, to host the tournament when it is next available, in 2030 – but officials are approaching the process a little more warily this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230c2cf9f50b73f0088f2886fa17cee2ecb4b132/13_95_4570_2742/master/4570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02533e76e32a75af7c1474f8f812360a","title":"traffic shashlik craft beer what world cup fans can expect in russia","story":"There are three ways out of depression, goes the joke: Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo. In Moscow, you’ll be arriving at one of these airports. Be careful of overpriced taxis and get thee to the Aeroexpress, high-speed trains that will spirit you to the city centres in Moscow and Sochi. Elsewhere, try a taxi app (see below) or look for an official taxi booth. For a ride from the airport, 1,500 roubles, or £18, is more than a fair price, with figures lower in the regions.Make sure you have your fan ID and tickets with you. Also don’t lose any little pieces of paper they give you at passport control: you’ll need them to get out!There was a time when you’d hail a passenger car by the side of the road and haggle over a fare, but these days most Russians use taxi apps instead. At least one of Uber, Yandex.Taxi and GetTaxi will work in most World Cup cities. You can pay by credit card and type addresses in English.Post-Soviet metros run like clockwork, with trains every few minutes. Six of the World Cuphost cities have undergrounds and there are tours of the ornate stations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. With road closures and mammoth traffic jams expected, the metro is a good bet for getting around quickly.City centres are generally safe to walk around in Russia. Do take care at night if drinking or around others who have been. Dodgy areas tend to be on the city outskirts. As gentrification spreads across the country, every downtown is now required to have a burger shop, a craft beer bar and at least one hipster hair salon advertised by a man brandishing an axe.Do yourself a favour and try Georgian food: cheesy khachapuri (adjaruli has a fried egg in the middle), shashlik, and khinkali (giant soup dumplings). Dry red wines, such as Saperavi, can be quite good. Georgian whites made in giant clay pots called kvevri are also worth a\u0026nbsptaste.Russian cuisine inspires less of a cult following but this is a good time to try golubtsy (stuffed cabbage) and borscht. There are several buffet-style chains that serve Russian cuisine and some innovative restaurants that are reimagining traditional staples. Russia has some excellent craft breweries, as well as century-old enterprises such as the Zhiguli beer factory in Samara.If you watch the news every day, you may know more about the controversies in Russian cities than what’s appealing about them. England’s three matches will send you to Volgograd, which voted to be called Stalingrad six days a year Kaliningrad, a Russian military stronghold on Europe’s borders and Nizhny Novgorod, an industrial hub on the Volga river.Each city is worth exploring. In Nizhny, take the cable car across the Volga and gaze upon the mother of all rivers (tamed by the Soviets’ hydroelectric works). In Volgograd, climb Mamayev Kurgan, the site of one of the second world war’s deadliest battles, and take in The Motherland Calls, the tallest statue in Europe at 280ft. In Kaliningrad, visit the Museum of the World Ocean and board the Soviet submarines (“One ping only,\u0026nbspVasily!”).Locals will know their cities best but heading for the golden-domed Orthodox churches (or minarets in Kazan) is always a good bet.Russians have a good sense of humour about the national side’s chances. “Who are you going to support after the group stages?” the joke goes. Talk politics at your own risk.Very rarely police can request to check your documents on the street. In those cases, make it clear you don’t speak Russian and comply. Also, if you find yourself at a political demonstration, avoid placing yourself between police and the\u0026nbspprotestors.When you give a toast, don’t say “na zdorovie,” a phrase that means “to your health” but is not used with alcohol. Instead try “za vstrechu!” meaning “to our meeting!” to kick off the evening, and then let your imagination run wild. A good rule of thumb is to keep your toasts fun and short, so don’t be that guy rambling on under the influence.Be forewarned. At some point during your visit a Russian will needle you: “What were you afraid of? A bear playing balalaika and drinking\u0026nbspvodka?”“No,” you’ll retort. “I was afraid of a paunchy man in a tracksuit named Vasya throwing me in his trunk and driving to Mordovia.”“You know Vasya?” your new Russian friend will reply with a hint of deference.•"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa364521aa3eb1ed36c1027e35f90a68a4b5481d/0_42_2529_1517/master/2529.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5d8efd2f6910fb0fde314cf1a294110","title":"world cup new rules dele alli england gareth southgate","story":"Dele Alli has insisted he will not fall foul of new Fifa regulations whereby players can be sanctioned retrospectively during the match in which they are involved at the World Cup.The new rules, which will work alongside VAR, mean match officials can be made aware of incidents that went unnoticed at the time and the relevant players can face yellow or red cards with on-pitch behaviour to be scrutinised like never before. Referees will have the power to take action at half-time, for example, if they are made aware of an incident from the opening 45 minutes.Gareth Southgate has already held a meeting with his squad, on the morning of the friendly against Nigeria, to explain the implications of the new regulation and Alli, who has been accused of going to ground too\u0026nbspeagerly and has endured disciplinary problems in the past, is confident he will avoid making similar mistakes\u0026nbspin Russia.“I’ve got everything under control,” said the England midfielder, who was banned for one-match ban by Fifa for an obscene gesture apparently directed at his team-mate Kyle Walker during a World Cup qualifier against Slovakia in September last year.“Every game is different, and you never know what’s going to happen, but that’s not what I’m going to be worrying about. There are a lot more things I need to focus on, and put my concentration on, in a game rather than that.Southgate has warned his players they must “be vigilant in all areas of the pitch” and suggested there had been tackles in recent games “that would be pulled up and might be yellow or red cards”.Alli said: “At the World Cup the referees and linesmen are all from a very high level anyway so you are always aware, and it’s part of football. You have to stay concentrated and you can’t do stupid things – and if you do, you have to learn from your mistakes. That’s just the way it is. I don’t think people will be trying to do bad things, and if they do, and they get punished for it, then it’s your own fault.“When you’re playing the games, you are focused on trying to help the team as much as you can, so you don’t want to put yourself in a position where you could jeopardise everything and lose the game for your team and your country. I’ll just be myself, the way I always am.“I want to play with passion, I want to play with hunger in every game I play, and I’ve made mistakes in the earlier part of my career – but you have to make mistakes in order to learn from them, and if you look at my record I’ve definitely learned from my mistakes.”Alli’s involvement in the friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March was limited to just 22\u0026nbspminutes in Amsterdam and, with Jesse Lingard having impressed over Southgate’s tenure to date, there had been suggestions the Tottenham player may miss out in the starting lineup this summer. However, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has since succumbed to injury, while Alli and Lingard proved against Nigeria at Wembley that they can thrive together. Ruben Loftus-Cheek will challenge for a starting place but Alli is expected to begin against Tunisia in Volgograd next Monday.“I wasn’t concerned as such,” said Alli, who featured in all four games at Euro\u0026nbsp2016 under Roy Hodgson. “As players, everyone who gets picked for England is used to playing regularly and obviously I was disappointed not to play, but it’s down to me to make sure that if the boss has a decision to make, I put myself in the best possible position to be picked.“I’ve been working hard in training. You go through a lot of things during the season – ups and downs physically – and on the field you don’t always perform to your full potential. But it was important that I came back hungry to make sure the manager had a decision to make. That’s what I did.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9a501e825c264d0919bc00689e8965765f0cec/183_294_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b208d5d2503fb42e529b59dfc87c0547","title":"world cup russia 2018 england messi ronaldo","story":"Restrained hopes around Gareth Southgate’s side are a good thing in a tournament that represents the last chance for two greats to join Maradona and Pelé in the World Cup pantheonAt least this time nobody has fallen into the trap of thinking England might actually win the damn thing. Nobody inside the England camp has proclaimed they are going to Russia to bring the trophy back home. And perhaps just as important, nobody in the media is feverishly backing our boys to do it. Not yet, anyway.Instead, the mood seems restrained compared to previous tournaments, as if the penny has dropped that England have not done a great deal in the World Cup since the year – the one between 1965 and 1967 – that Jürgen Klopp has suggested we no longer mention because of the pressure it puts on the team.Sensible advice bearing in mind England’s footballers have managed a grand total of six wins in the knockout stages of major international tournaments since, well, That Year Again. The last one was 12 years ago, against Ecuador, and if all this sounds downbeat it’s difficult, in fairness, to be a cheerleader when the most recent memory of England in a major tournament is Iceland’s Viking thunderclap, Harry Kane’s corner-taking and the mutinous chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” from Euro 2016.Roy Hodgson’s reign as England manager ended within minutes of that defeat to Iceland and he spent the night in a corner of the bar of the team’s hotel in Chantilly, with nobody else around and the lights off. The next day, when he was persuaded to speak to the media, the top three buttons of his shirt were undone, his hands were trembling and his fingernails were bitten to the quick.Alternatively, there’s the memory of Steven Gerrard at the 2014 World Cup, when England were eliminated inside a week and left Brazil before the players had even finished their course of anti-malaria tablets. Gerrard hadn’t slept much either. He was “hurting bad, broken”. England’s captain sat silently – dark smudges under his eyes, a week’s worth of stubble – staring into the distance as Hodgson talked about a “period of grieving”.Let’s not be too negative, though. England have some talented players, and indeed a sprinkling of excellent ones, and at the time of writing nobody has been struck down by the curse of the metatarsal just yet. Yes, Gareth Southgate’s team have been drawn against Belgium, third in Fifa’s world rankings, but there are more obliging games, against Panama and Tunisia, first. If those can be won, England will already be assured of a place in the knockout stages before they meet Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard et al.Nothing can be taken for granted, of course, given the ordeal against Iceland nudges out the defeat to the USA in the 1950 World Cup as the most mortifying result in England’s history. Likewise, it does not feel too long ago since the Sun splashed with an “E-A-S-Y” front‑page headline after the 2010 World Cup draw to let us know it would be England against Algeria, Slovenia and – to make it work – the Yanks. England stank out that tournament, too.It does help, though, that expectations this time are more realistic. Kyle Walker has said England will need a “miracle” to get their hands on the trophy in Moscow and it puts things into context to imagine the runaround Southgate’s team would likely be given by a France XI made up of players Les Bleus have left out.When Southgate named his squad the only controversies were the absence of Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey. Didier Deschamps, the France manager, has omitted Alexandre Lacazette, Anthony Martial and Karim Benzema, not to mention Dimitri Payet, Aymeric Laporte, Kingsley Coman and others who would be mandatory picks for most other teams.France will take some beating but so will Brazil, Germany and all the other usual suspects. Otherwise, there will be two players in particular who are determined to make a lasting impression. Lionel Messi will be 35 when the World Cup is held in Qatar in 2022. Cristiano Ronaldo will be 37. Between them, they have won the Ballon d’Or 10 times. Yet, realistically, this will be the last opportunity these two modern greats get to make a decisive impact on this stage.Can one of these two showmen be remembered for Russia 2018 in the same way that Diego Maradona is for Mexico 1986, Pelé in 1970 and so on? Messi was named the best player of the last World Cup. It felt generous at the time and, harsh as it may sound, the fact is we are still waiting for a truly Messi-inspired tournament.As for England, it does not feel too outlandish to imagine Southgate’s team navigating a route to the quarter-finals. The problem is that Brazil or Germany could be waiting and that is usually the point when we are reminded, as John Cleese once put it, that the nation that invented the sport has barely seen a penny in royalties ever since.All of which means it is probably not such a bad thing that the English football public is hardened to disappointment. Serial disappointments, indeed. Two more of these tournaments, on the back of this one, and the chances are it will be 30 years since “30 years of hurt” became part of the soundtrack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17d22f40fb27aafc9235311d8e45db2941d7217/518_350_3290_1973/master/3290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51bb0b2c27a5b689a8c778e51a675311","title":"nigel slater lemon thyme water ice apricot sorbet pistachio cookies recipes","story":"Soothing, sweet and piquant desserts to round off a lovely summer lunchAfter lunch, the table still scattered with crumbs, squeezed lemons and the shrapnel from the shells of a pile of grilled langoustines, we brought out fruit water ices to eat in the late afternoon shade. There was a sorbet of apricots, barely frozen, the colour of the setting sun, and another vivid with lemon and thyme. The sorbets cooled our tongues after the heat of the shellfish and for five minutes there was blissful silence.You don’t need an ice cream machine to make sorbets, but having access to one will give a smoother texture. If you haven’t got one, just remember to give the fruit purée a stir every hour as it freezes. Folding the frozen surface and those sparkling outer edges that are first to freeze into the middle will produce an ice akin to one which has been churned.It was one day last week, cooking lamb cutlets over a smoking grill, that I crushed a bunch of lemon thyme in my hand and mentioned, only half seriously, that I would love to make an ice cream with something of the resinous-citrus flavour of that herb. This week I had a go. The idea that it was going to taste of something more than lemon came as I tasted the syrup in which I had stuffed a handful of sprigs and let it sit for an hour to take up the herb’s essential oils. I used fresh lemons as well, fat ones from my local Turkish greengrocer with their reassuringly glossy leaves and unexpected thorns.The second ice was one I have tried to make before, but was disappointed by its lack of depth. Apricot is a tricky flavour to harness. The trick is to roast the fruit, allowing it to cook almost to the point of collapse, its amber flesh caramelising in the process. The flavour, second time round, was that fleeting thing, a truly ripe apricot warmed by the sun.Put the sugar in a small, heavy-based saucepan, pour in the water and place over a moderate heat. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the peel from the lemon in thin strips, push into the sugar and water and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.Rinse the bunch of lemon thyme under cold running water, bash it lightly with a rolling pin, then push it down into the syrup with a spoon, cover with a lid and leave to cool. Refrigerate until thoroughly cold. You could speed up the infusion by putting the pan into a large bowl of ice.Remove the pan from the fridge and lift out the bunch of lemon thyme, shaking it as you go. Don’t worry if some of the leaves fall off into the syrup. Pour the lemon juice into the syrup, then pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine and churn until almost frozen. Transfer to a plastic freezer box and freeze till needed.To make the ice without a machine, pour the syrup and lemon juice into a plastic freezer box and mix thoroughly. Freeze for 2 hours, then stir and return to the freezer. Continue freezing and occasionally stirring until frozen.Serves 6apricots 600gcaster sugar 200gwater 200mllemon juice of 1Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Halve and stone the apricots and put them, cut side up, in a nonstick roasting tin or baking dish. Scatter half the sugar over them and roast for about 20 minutes, checking the sugar has melted and is browning, but not burning. Remove from the oven when the apricots are fully soft and the syrup is golden. While the apricots are roasting, put the remaining sugar into a small saucepan with the water and lemon juice and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat as soon as the sugar has dissolved and leave to cool.Tip the apricots and their roasting juices into a food processor and blend to a smooth purée then pour in the cooled syrup and combine. Transfer the apricot mixture to an ice-cream machine and churn until almost frozen, before scooping into a freezer box, covering tightly and freezing until needed.To make the sorbet without a machine, pour the apricot mixture into a plastic freezer box and mix thoroughly.

That’s the conclusion of new survey from Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, which draws a direct line between loss of the watchful eyes of local newspapers and a decline in government efficiency. Paul Gao, a professor of finance at the college, said he got the idea for the study while watching John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight about the decline of local newspapers almost two years ago.The result of that study, Financing Dies in Darkness? The Impact of Newspaper Closures on Public Finance, argues there is a direct correlation between the loss of a local paper and higher costing – or less efficient – government. Those reductions have come with a cost, according to Gao. A local newspaper, the authors conclude, holds an important and unique role in the proper functioning of the government and markets. “Some people told us a local newspaper doesn’t have an important local role. Others said they may play a role, but something else, some other alternative source of media, will come in,” Gao told the . “We think the local newspaper plays an important and unique role that cannot be easily replaced by an online source or national news media.” Gao’s team looked at some 1,600 English-language newspapers serving 1,266 counties in the US between 1996-2015 and excluded counties without a daily local newspaper. In one example, the report looks at the closure in 2009 of Denver’s Rocky Mountain News. The paper had provided extensive coverage of local government issues, including an audit of questionable federal funds allocated to the sheriff’s department, and a series of other handshake deals. Gao’s team looked at how tax dollars were being spent while the paper was being published and then again after the paper had closed. The researchers concluded that Rocky Mountain News stories had served as a watchdog agent. Without it, the spread or yield of newly issued local municipal bonds increased by 37 basis points. In other words, local government’s cost of borrowing money – and therefore risk – had increased once the paper had gone.The researchers also looked at the Cincinnati Post, which closed in 2007. In that instance too, the median yield spread for newly issued local municipal bonds increased by about 66.1 basis points – another indication, according to the authors, that public finances suffer when a newspaper closes. Gao does not offer any particular solution – his job, he says, is just to raise the issue. “We can’t offer a solution because this is to do with public good, not statistical analysis,” he said. “You cannot effectively charge public good. So we hope this paper raises awareness of the importance of a local newspaper. It’s like a public good or an environmental protection. Good to have but, we also recognize, ultimately costly.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1faaa3f5fcd438b4bef8e663eb574098a5b5a28/40_136_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c342a5936b0e2a601de90fd8aac416d4","title":"mean girls gifs international relations","story":"Should we be concerned after the US Israeli embassy responded to Iran’s supreme leader with a Regina George quote?This week, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered preparations to be made to begin enriching uranium if the 2015 nuclear deal collapses completely. It’s a move that could further destabilise relations between Iran and the west and begin a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. The ayatollah followed up with tweets saying Israel was a “cancerous tumour” that must be “removed and eradicated”.How did the Israeli embassy in the United States respond to this potential doomsday scenario? With a Regina George gif from Mean Girls:It’s the latest case of countries acting like warring reality TV stars, using gifs and memes to send “shade” across borders.Take the Crimean peninsula, where armed conflict has been simmering between Ukrainian and Russian forces since 2014. The war has often been bloody, but online, the countries have been sparring in more jovial terms. Last month, the official national Twitter accounts of the respective countries were arguing over who could lay claim to the 11th-century French monarch Anne de Kiev. Annoyed that @Russia was claiming that a monarch born in Kiev was Russian, @Ukraine posted a gif taken from an episode of The Simpsons in which the Russian ambassador to the UN flicks around a “Russia” nameplate to read “Soviet Union”.It’s not the first time Ukraine has used TV gifs to wind up Russia. When the country expelled 13 Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack in the UK, in which a former KGB agent and his daughter were poisoned, Ukraine enlisted the support of The Master from Doctor Who to wave them on their way.The Russian embassy in London is perhaps the most ruthless when it comes to the weaponising of memes. Not only does it mock the British government with gags about how frosty relations are, but it also has a “diplomatic club” – a fan club of sorts whose members are asked to retweet the account’s posts. In return, they can win prizes and potential receptions at the embassy. Essentially, the embassy uses fans to promote its cheap jokes so they reach a wider audience.These tweets are obviously silly, but does that mean they shouldn’t be taken seriously? Are they just outbursts from low-level government employees blowing off steam – or do we have to see them as serious public statements?These are questions the US has had to grapple with every time Donald Trump picks up his phone, and some have argued that it’s better to ignore the president’s tweets and focus on his actions. But Constance Duncombe, a lecturer in international relations at Monash University who has written papers on the role of social media in modern diplomacy, says we can’t ignore what happens online.“We should take Twitter outbursts seriously, either as considered diplomatic signalling or as a personal response to feeling the image of one’s state has been tarnished or undermined,” she says. “Diplomacy is not always about maintaining a polite demeanour, and diplomats will deploy subtle insults or snubs to bolster their national image or to manage the behaviour of their counterparts.”What’s changed, she argues, is how public these outbursts have become. Settling scores in an accessible, cultural language, viewable to all, sends a clear message that might otherwise be difficult to project. “Using pop culture images, memes and gifs frames insults through humour or sarcasm, making the diplomat or state leader’s views instantly accessible and allowing its meaning to travel beyond the immediate interpersonal or institutional interaction.”Not everyone is a natural at such exchanges. After Trump repeatedly tweeted about how awful the Paris climate accord was and even suggested the cold east coast could “use a little global warming”, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, couldn’t quite match his bombast.Perhaps Tusk should be applauded for maintaining a semblance of political demeanour. Or perhaps the only way to win in this new world is to fight fire with fire and he should have repurposed another Mean Girls quote: “The world is getting hot. It might even be hotter than Regina George.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac3d4c5e74217b4a0b1330accedfb6a6d3bf845/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e0d3e98a2921869b773a8debc7b4804","title":"50 great tracks for june christine queens playboi carti the 1975","story":"From Troye Sivan’s ode to bottoming to Oneohtrix Point Never’s joyous electronic cheese, here are 50 tracks you shouldn’t be without this month – subscribe to the whole playlist and read about 10 of the bestby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesOr rather, Chris and the Queens. In her accompanying notes on Genius, the returning French pop star explains how this song sees her take on a macho persona as a way of sparring with male sexual energy – even if there are those who will reject her for it. Also done in French as sister recording Damn, Dis-Moi, Girlfriend is set to HD 80s boogie production – redolent of the guest star Dam-Funk, who delivers some deep, sexy vocal interjections.In a very strong month for rap albums, what with A$AP Rocky’s impressionistically blunted Testing and Pusha T’s Kanye-produced side of beef Daytona both proving excellent, Playboi Carti’s newest full-length, Die Lit, still stood out. His hopscotching flow broke through on Magnolia last year, and that track’s producer, Pi’erre Bourne, is the key to the album’s hazy appeal. For Fell In Luv, he cuts up a sample of a sample – Purity Ring’s lift of Young Magic – to end up with something Holly Herndon might make if she segued into mumble-rap production.Recent months have seen the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy credited with inspiring a spuriously named genre called Healywave (though he prefers Mattycore). To be fair, he has worked with most of the acts connected with it – his Dirty Hit labelmates Pale Waves and No Rome – and to be even fairer, it should probably be called Hutchencewave for its clear debt to INXS. Still, technicalities: no sooner had the term started catching on (sort of) than the 1975 return with a completely new sound. The first track from their third album hooks around a single, strangulated riff that sounds a bit like Room on Fire-era Strokes rendered as a polyphonic ringtone. It’s miles better than that suggests, and completely unlike anything else on the radio. Like always, Healy’s lyrics veer between ludicrous and devoutly sincere, touching on STDs, finding grey hairs in your “zoot” (zoot!) and an impressively self-lacerating description of himself as “a millennial that baby boomers like”. As neurotic as the song is, Healy suggests being kinder to yourself as you grow up the strangely affecting Give Yourself a Try is a sign of the 1975 letting themselves grow in weird and wonderful ways.Speaking of Healywave, there’s definitely a touch of the 1975 in the muted guitar that chimes through the second chorus of Troye Sivan’s excellent single Bloom. But most of this glorious ode to bottoming shimmers by on synths that channel the sense of anticipation and nervousness that Sivan conveys as he plays the part of a receptive partner losing his virginity. It’s stylishly done stuff: his voice on the tantalising first verse is coated in whispery reverb, an invitation to come closer, while the choruses are peppered with subtle gasps that imbue the elegant Bloom with an indecently good sense of lust.It seems far too long since Tirzah’s brief run of brilliance in the mid-2010s – not least the brilliantly scruffy I’m Not Dancing. Similarly earwormy is Gladly, the first single from her long-awaited debut album Devotion (out this August on Domino). Produced by Mica Levi, the track lopes sleepily around a single loop, a heavy, warped piano refrain that seems to pace around in circles and mirrors Tirzah’s state of mind. “All I want is you,” she repeats, drowsy with longing and obsession: “I love you.” Proof that the simplest songs are sometimes the most profound.It’s been a banner month for the Tottenham MC. Not only has he guested on standout tracks on the aforementioned Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky albums – appearing on stage with the latter and a giant crash test dummy head in London – he has also released one of his strongest solo tracks ever. Over a minimalist beat that perfectly encapsulates the way he currently straddles grime and US rap, Pure Water sees him announce his own greatness with armour-plated self-confidence.Thirty-four years ago, Prophet self-released 1,000 copies of Right on Time, an album of scuffed, wonky but compelling electro-funk that disappeared without trace. But it was coveted by Stones Throw label head Peanut Butter Wolf, who met with Prophet and got him in the studio to finally do the follow-up. Tonight is a rerecorded version of a track from his debut, which was covered by Nite Jewel in 2011, who turns up here to join in the homecoming: a magnificent, stumbling funk jam. Nite Jewel – one of the most underrated songwriters around today – has her own track on the playlist too, On Your Own, a Hi-NRG synth workout topped with a soaring vocal.The Brooklyn garage rockers keep knocking out classic after classic, with new LP Wide Awake! another essential collection of varied, literate, totally satisfying jams. One highlight, Freebird II – the title typical of their droll hipster humour – features a big, satisfying organ melody matched by a blokey singalong for the chorus. Andrew Savage’s verses are like a positivist spin on those from Human Performance, the title lament from the band’s last album.Miss Red was born in Israel to Moroccan-Polish parents but, with her girlish patois, she sounds more like she was brought up in a Kingston ghetto. Pairing her once more with producer the Bug, who she accosted at a Tel Aviv rave and went on to tour and record with, Dagga is the first track from her debut album. One of the Bug’s hallmark industrial-dancehall riddims rides under Miss Red’s coquettish singsong vocals.Fresh from a brilliant score for the Robert Pattison thriller Good Time, and following a string of albums of densely splintered electronics, Daniel Lopatin has released an ambitious new record in Age Of. It finds space for drunken harpsichords, Anohni, terrifying shouting, tender Bon Iver-style digital songcraft, harsh trap and jazzy synth solos, and yet hangs together: he is the great sonic essayist of our voracious, always-on culture. The highlight is the symphonic Toys 2, his biggest, cheesiest moment yet, and his most moving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/913ade4e312ca40858ba27b0cc713faff8a596ff/0_145_3058_1835/master/3058.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ac32380fdab0c339371ad98bd2d6538","title":"3000 year old sculpture leaves researchers scratching their heads","story":"Exquisite Old Testament-era head of a king found in Israel but subject’s identity a mystery An enigmatic sculpture of a king’s head dating back nearly 3,000 years has left researchers guessing at whose face it depicts.The 5cm (two-inch) sculpture is an exceedingly rare example of figurative art from the region during the ninth century BC – a period associated with biblical kings. It is exquisitely preserved but for a bit of missing beard, and nothing quite like it has been found before.While scholars are certain the stern-bearded figure wearing a golden crown represents royalty, they are less sure which king it symbolises, or which kingdom he may have ruled.Archaeologists unearthed the figurine in 2017 during excavations at a site called Abel Beth Maacah, located just south of Israel’s border with Lebanon, near the modern-day town of Metula.Nineteenth-century archaeologists identified the site, then home to a village called Abil al-Qamh, with the similarly named city mentioned in the Old Testament’s Book of Kings.During the ninth century BC, the ancient town was situated in a liminal zone between three regional powers: the Aramean kingdom based in Damascus to the east, the Phoenician city of Tyre to the west and the Israelite kingdom, with its capital in Samaria to the south.Kings 1 15:20 mentions Abel Beth Maacah in a list of cities attacked by the Aramean king Ben Hadad in a campaign against the Israelite kingdom.“This location is very important because it suggests that the site may have shifted hands between these polities, more likely between Aram-Damascus and Israel,” said Hebrew University archaeologist Naama Yahalom-Mack, who has headed the joint dig with California’s Azusa Pacific University since 2013.Yahalom-Mack’s team was digging through the floor of a massive iron age structure in the summer of 2017 when a volunteer struck pay dirt. The layer where the head was found dates to the the epoch associated with the rival biblical kingdoms of Israel and Judah.In a rare move, archaeologists and curators at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem rushed to put the piece on public display. A detailed report is set for publication in the June edition of the journal Near Eastern Archaeology.Eran Arie, Israel Museum’s curator of iron age and Persian archaeology, said the discovery was one of a kind. “In the iron age, if there’s any figurative art, and there largely isn’t, it’s of very low quality. And this is of exquisite quality.”The royal figurine is made of faience, a glass-like material that was popular in jewellery and small human and animal figurines in ancient Egypt and the Near East.“The colour of the face is greenish because of this copper tint that we have in the silicate paste,” Yahalom-Mack said. But a crucial clue for identifying it as a Near Eastern monarch was its “very interesting hairdo”, she said, which looks similar to the way ancient Egyptians depicted neighbouring Near Eastern peoples in art.“The guy kind of represents the generic way Semitic people are described,” she said.Because carbon-14 dating cannot give a more exact date for the statue’s creation other than some time in the ninth century, the field of potential candidates is large. Yahalom-Mack posited it could be kings Ben Hadad or Hazael of Damascus, Ahab or Jehu of Israel, or Ithobaal of Tyre – all characters appearing in the biblical narrative.“We’re only guessing here, it’s like a game,” she said. “It’s like a hello from the past, but we don’t know anything else about it.”As scholars debate whether the head was a standalone piece or part of a larger statue, the Hebrew University team is set to restart digging this month at the spot where the mystery king’s head was found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04081c0da88b395dd56cadf9323872006e003847/0_158_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfb786699d9cc1054638acbcfb8bc141","title":"pregnant womans removal from gp list prompts investigation","story":"NHS Scotland to investigate why woman was told she was not entitled to treatmentAn investigation has been launched after an ill and heavily pregnant woman was illegally removed from her GP’s list, told she was not entitled to NHS treatment in Scotland and wrongly charged more than £4,000 for treatment she had already received.Amber Hussain (not her real name), who has lived in the UK since 2012 and already had a British-born child, was in the process of applying for leave to remain as a spouse when she was told she was not entitled to NHS services.It is illegal for NHS Scotland to remove a patient from a GP list, irrespective of their nationality or immigration status. It is also illegal to charge someone for health services they have already received on the basis that no charges would be made. NHS Scotland’s own rules state that: “No woman should ever be denied maternity services in Scotland, or have such services delayed, regardless of her liability, or ability, to pay when charges apply.”Amber was not able to visit her GP in the weeks leading up to her second child’s birth earlier this month. She had to diagnose her symptoms herself with the help of the internet and guess which medication she needed to purchase from her local pharmacy.While trying to persuade the Scottish government to overturn its decision, Amber also received an invoice for £4,186 for NHS treatment she had received between 2016 and 2017. The bill noted she was an “overseas patient” and that the sum was due immediately.After the  questioned her treatment, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde reimbursed her for the money she had already paid and the remaining debt has been paused while the investigation is conducted. NHS Scotland’s Practitioner Services Division has announced an investigation into the case, but has not contacted Amber, who is still waiting to be told that she can visit her GP or access care without fear of being charged.“The birth of our beloved daughter was completely overshadowed by the stress and anxiety caused by the first bill and the second, similar bill we expected to get to cover the costs of her birth and my wife’s postnatal care in hospital,” said her husband, Ali Hussain. “We couldn’t enjoy our new baby because we were expecting bailiffs to turn up at our door at every moment.”Amber suffered complications after the birth and was kept in hospital on a pay as you go scheme, where every item was charged for. “The birth of a new child should be the most happy thing in the world,” said Ali (not his real name). “But I couldn’t stop myself counting each nappy the baby used and each blanket, and imagining the bill going up and up.”Ali, who has two master’s degrees from UK universities, was a sales and service officer at a UK bank, earning £21,000. In 2015, his accountant realised that an error made by one of his employees in the 2010-11 accounting year had resulted in Ali under-declaring his self-employment income by £8,000. “Straightaway, my accountant sent a revised return to HMRC and all taxes were paid,” said Ali. “HMRC accepted the correction and never imposed any penalty.”The Home Office, however, said the tax amendment was sufficient evidence that Ali should be deported under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules, designed in part to deal with terrorists and those judged to be a risk to national security.“During the course of my 12 years’ stay in the UK I never claimed any kind of benefit, I’ve always been a taxpayer, never broken any law and never even committed a traffic offence,” he said. “How can the Home Office classify me a ‘threat to national security’ based on this one minor tax amendment?“Their effort to link tax correction with ‘national security’ is entirely unjustified and a blatant mockery of the principles of fairness and justice,” he added. “The pain my wife and I have, and the stress and suffering we are going through is beyond measure and perhaps beyond imagination.”In March, Ali was called to report to an immigration centre. He attended with his heavily pregnant wife and believes an official he dealt with then forwarded his wife’s details to the NHS. “A few days later, we received a letter from NHS Scotland saying they had been informed by the UK Home Office that my wife was a visitor to the UK and not entitled to NHS services. The letter said she had been removed from the NHS list at her GP surgery with immediate effect.”With their baby due weeks later and Amber’s health condition worsening, Ali employed solicitors to reverse the Home Office’s decision. The solicitor wrote repeatedly to the Home Office, as did the family’s MP, Paul Masterton.“We repeatedly tried to get the Home Office to admit its mistake, stressing the urgency of my wife’s condition,” said Ali. “But they refused to answer letters from me or from our solicitor, and they lied to our MP, too, by wrongly telling them that my wife’s appeal had been refused and then that it was out of time, neither of which are true.”A Scottish government spokesperson said: “Regardless of residency status, everybody in Scotland is entitled to receive immediate and necessary treatment at a GP practice. On that basis, this case is being reviewed by NHS Scotland’s Practitioner Services Division to ensure that the correct procedures are followed.”A Home Office spokesperson said they could not comment on inidual cases.Ali added: “I would like to share a flavour of the treatment we got at the reporting centre in Glasgow. I was sitting in front of an officer on the counter and my heavily pregnant and ill wife was standing alongside me. During the session, when I was providing information to the immigration officer’s queries my wife was unable to stand any further because she was not feeling well, and took an empty chair just two steps away. “The immigration officer angrily asked me why she was sitting down and said she needed to stand in front of her. The officer made my wife stand again in front of her in total disregard to her physical condition,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44f0edbeeb7b9fc75ab5dc4c47bbac91c2fe5643/0_224_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc43a8e57a383f54321d8e3b5638d7c","title":"councils able to replace one third homes sold under right to buy","story":"Local Government Association calls for ‘fundamental reform’ in the way scheme is fundedThe government’s right-to-buy scheme risks running out of homes unless councils are given funding to build more, a report has warned. Research by the Local Government Association found local authorities only have enough money to replace less than one-third of the number of homes sold over the past six years. In addition to providing extra funding, the LGA is calling on the government to allow councils to keep all the receipts for the properties they sell, rather than having to hand over a portion to the Treasury. According to the figures, more than 60,000 properties have been sold under the scheme since 2012, at average prices of half the market rate – leaving local authorities with enough funds to build or purchase only 14,000 replacement homes. The LGA said two-thirds of councils in England will have no chance of replacing the same number of homes sold off under right to buy in five years’ time without “significant” restructuring of the scheme. About 12,000 properties were sold under the scheme last year, but the study showed that by 2023, councils would only be able to replace 2,000 of them.The LGA said local authorities’ ability to reinvest in housing was hampered by a rule that meant a significant portion of all right-to-buy receipts had to be handed over to Whitehall, rather than the communities in which the homes were sold. Martin Tett, the LGA’s housing spokesman, said the scheme, which was first implemented under Margaret Thatcher and revived during David Cameron’s time as prime minister, was in danger without “fundamental reform” of its funding. “We know that the right to buy changes lives – it helps people who otherwise wouldn’t be able to get on the ladder experience the security and independence of home ownership. It is essential that it continues to do so,” he said. “Councils urgently need funding to support the replacement of homes sold off under the scheme, or there’s a real chance they could be all but eliminated. Without a pipeline of new homes, future generations cannot benefit from the scheme.”A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government remained committed to helping people get a foot on the housing ladder through the scheme.“We will be consulting local authorities in the coming months on ways to increase their flexibility to replace homes sold, and will announce further details in due course,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f98a5bcf83580294588ce561201e9f0dade2b9/0_152_3939_2365/master/3939.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bc95594bb3df1b95b282039fe8e2ca9","title":"calum macleod scotland england","story":"Calum MacLeod believes Scotland have delivered a massive statement through their historic first victory over England and one that could prove the ideal catalyst for cricket north of the border.It was the 29-year-old’s stunning unbeaten 140 from 94 balls that powered the Saltires to their six-run win and, speaking after the dramatic finish – one that left English faces as red as their change strip – he credited their coach, Grant Bradburn, and captain, Kyle Coetzer.“This win has been coming for a couple of years since Grant and Kyle took over and pushed the aggressive cricket you saw,” MacLeod said. “To take the step up to beat a full England side, No1 ranked in the world, is a massive statement from Scottish cricket.MacLeod’s own story is impressive, having started out life as a seam bowler at Warwickshire only for his action to be deemed illegal. The Glaswegian has since converted himself into a batsman and, while he is currently a player-coach for Bexley in Kent, following a disappointing time at Durham, another county chance may well follow.He said: “Anyone who watched that game on Sky will see 11 cricketers in the shop window and all are capable of winning games for counties. But I do not want to get too far ahead and should enjoy spending time celebrating this win.“We want more games. That is the bigger shop window rather than the personal side. If the ICC and other international teams look at this game, they will see we are not an add-on. This should be a catalyst for more games. Anyone here or watching could see the energy from the crowd and what passion there is for cricket up here.”Eoin Morgan admitted his England team would not have deserved the win even if they had knocked off the final seven runs in their pursuit of 372. Australia, over five matches, come next and the captain is demanding a rapid improvement.“We didn’t play anywhere near to our best,” said Morgan. “We were miles off where we expect to be and didn’t do enough to win. We might have scraped past them and won, but there were still quite a few mistakes made that we need to rectify and learn from ahead of the Australia series.“It is huge for Scotland, too. I’m not hugely disappointed about it because it was a good competitive game and that is all we could have asked for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/738fec7acb44712da4db1683ed1dbf248aeb88d3/0_157_4709_2825/master/4709.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5992db8f7c070308b76dae687c8ab6cf","title":"sebastian vettel wins canadian grand prix f1 championship lewis hamilton","story":"Sebastian Vettel’s win at the Canadian Grand Prix clearly meant a great deal to the driver and his team but, though he played down its significance in the world championship, it may prove to have been a turning point.His victory was utterly dominant and of real import is the blow it dealt his rival Lewis Hamilton from which the British driver knows he faces a tough fightback.The win also highlighted Vettel’s ice-cold focus, as he brushed off a bizarre incident when the model Winnie Harlow waved the chequered flag a lap too early. Hamilton’s celebrity friend later tweeted she was told to do so but was glad “no one was hurt”.Hamilton’s fifth place, his lowest finish this season, was the nadir of what had been a difficult weekend from start to finish and ended with his title advantage over Vettel eradicated. The world champion had gone into the meeting in Montreal with a 14-point lead but leaves one point behind Vettel, a swing he would not have anticipated at one of his favourite circuits. He took it on the chin but after engines proved a major factor he also delivered a stinging criticism of the regulations limiting the number of power units.This is the third time the championship lead has changed hands in seven races but Hamilton had come to Montreal firmly on the front foot. He leaves with Vettel having delivered a reminder that Hamilton and Mercedes will have to be at the very top of their game if the British driver is to be the one who adds to his four world titles.Vettel had not won since the second round in Bahrain and Ferrari had not won here since Michael Schumacher did so in 2004. His joyous response to the result was unsurprising then but scoring it at the circuit named after one of Enzo Ferrari’s favourites, Gilles Villeneuve, who took his first GP win here for the Scuderia in 1978, made it all the more special. “It means a lot to me,” he said. “A great weekend for us and 40 years after Gilles’ victory here to have Ferrari win again and for a long time since Michael. I would never have dreamt to be the first after him. But this year there are so many races to come, we enjoy the victory and take the points but there is a long way to go.”The win marks Vettel’s 50th career victory, with only Schumacher, Hamilton and Alain Prost having scored more. But the number that will matter to the German is the single-digit advantage with which he leaves Montreal. Having shown some formidable race pace in the opening rounds, the Ferrari had been on the back foot to Mercedes but they brought an engine upgrade to this race which has put them right back in contention. Mercedes were also due to bring a new engine but put it back to the next round in France and Hamilton’s, on its seventh race here, suffered from overheating.“I am so happy that I finished,” he said. “From the start I was down on power, the engine was over temperature and I thought it was going to fail. I could have lost a lot more points today.” Teams are limited to three engines a season and Hamilton was concerned this could be decisive. “I hope we don’t go to two engines next year,” he said. “That is ridiculous. That a season could be swayed through reliability, no one wants to see that, no one wants to be cheated of that. The sport is going in the wrong direction.”The race was deservedly Vettel’s. Leading from the off, he proceeded to put in a series of exemplary laps to open up an immediate gap to Valtteri Bottas, who finished second. Even given the new engine, the German had the pace of the field and managed his superb one-stop race untroubled to the flag. Were any reminder needed that he is a fearsome talent with the right car, Canada was salutary evidence.Hamilton, who had a difficult weekend, was unusually out of sorts at a track where he has six victories and was jumped during his pitstop by Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo in a race that had quickly become a damage limitation exercise. His engine was six races old but nonetheless Hamilton would have expected better. He was able to match Ricciardo, who finished fourth behind his team-mate Max Verstappen, and chased him down but, with a one-stop race, tyre management to the fore and the difficulty the current cars present in closing, he, like all the front six, was forced into what proved a procession.Vettel now has the momentum and Hamilton and Mercedes have much to consider before racing resumes in France but the British driver still believes they can re-assert their ascendancy over a fragile Ferrari. “There is no reason to lose control,” he said. “Keep our heads down, keep motivated, because they will falter. We have to apply the pressure.”Fernando Alonso had no reason to celebrate his 300th grand prix, forced to retire his McLaren on lap 43 and the Spaniard will doubtless be pleased to leave Canada to focus on taking part in the Le Mans 24 Hours next weekend. Kimi Räikkönen was in sixth, the Renault’s of Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz in seventh and eighth. The Force India of Esteban Ocon was in ninth, with Charles Leclerc’s Sauber in tenth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ef6928f406f2d589f0502e48c3b0773ae6aacc/0_474_3450_2070/master/3450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac10337c844933b74501b784195897f","title":"human cost kindle amazon china foxconn jeff bezos","story":"In the Chinese city of Hengyang, we find a fatigued, disposable workforce assembling gadgets for Amazon, owned by the world’s richest man.by  Gethin Chamberlain in Hengyang, ChinaFive o’clock in the morning and the young woman’s eyelids are drooping. All night she has been removing spots of dust from Amazon smartspeakers with a toothbrush. Time seems to crawl. Now she is overwhelmed with exhaustion.She works on, more and more slowly, until she can do no more. She looks around the workshop. Other workers have rested their heads on the bench. She slumps forward and falls asleep.Let’s call the young woman Alexa. Alexa, what are you doing here?For an answer, we must fast forward a couple of months to last Monday. It is an overcast morning in the city of Hengyang, in the southern Chinese province of Hunan. More than seven million people live in this city, the second-largest in the province. It is known locally as the Wild Goose City, for the birds that used to stop off on their southerly migration, but many people even within China would struggle to find it on a map.The morning is warm but overcast, with a light haze that could be fog or pollution. The road to the Foxconn factory in Baishazhou Industrial Park is wide and lined with well-cared-for plants. There’s a steady stream of cars, motorbikes and buses heading towards the factory, which sits back from the road behind a large gate. Blue-uniformed security staff keep watch on those coming in and the street outside.Dozens of workers are arriving, casually dressed in jeans and T-shirts. Most are young and there is a good mixture of women and men. Ahead of them lies a 60-hour week, eight regular hours for five days, plus two more of overtime each day and another 10 on Saturday. They will be expected to hit tough targets and must ask permission to use the toilets. The overtime – up to 80 hours a month – is far in excess of the 36 hours stipulated in Chinese labour laws, but companies can and do seek exemptions and workers want the overtime, to boost their basic pay.These are the people who are making the smart speakers and tablets that Amazon hopes to make a fixture in millions more homes around the world this year: the Echo and Echo Dot – which both spring to life when the user addresses them as Alexa – and the Kindles.It is a year since Amazon sealed a deal with the giant Foxconn company to ramp up its hardware production in Hengyang, with the Chinese firm reportedly adding 30 new production lines and creating 15,000 jobs.The Foxconn factory in Hengyang relies on the tried and tested formula of low wages and long hours. But here there is another element: the extensive use of agency workers who don’t have the security of a regular job.These employees – known as dispatch workers in China – are hired in from labour companies as an off-the-shelf workforce. They are generally slightly better-paid than permanent members of staff, but they get no sick pay or holiday pay and can be laid off without any pay at all during quiet months when production drops off. In some ways they resemble the Amazon products they are making: wanted one day and discarded the next.Bezos is worth an estimated £102bn, a fortune he acquired against a backdrop of global reports of misery for Amazon’s warehouse workers, exhausted by the demands made on them in return for the most basic of wages. Unions and labour rights groups have protested about low pay and harsh working conditions, and three delivery firms used by Amazon are facing a legal challenge from the GMB union, demanding that gig economy delivery drivers receive sick pay and holiday pay.Last month it was revealed that ambulances had been called 600 times to Amazon’s UK warehouses over the past three years. There have been repeated calls for Amazon to improve the lot of its workers.But Bezos doesn’t see the need. Collecting an award for “outstanding personalities who are particularly innovative, and who generate and change markets, influence culture and at the same time face up to their responsibility to society” a couple of months ago, he was questioned about the controversies surrounding the way he made his money.“When you’re criticised,” he said, “first look in the mirror and decide: are your critics right? If they are right, change. Don’t resist.”But Bezos’s mirror apparently showed him that his critics were wrong. “I’m very proud of our working conditions and very proud of the wages we pay,” he told the audience gathered to fete him.And now he and Gou have brought that same formula to Hengyang. But what draws two of the world’s richest men to set up in a city far from the big manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, with their easy access to shipping and huge industrial bases?For an answer, it helps to know that Alexa is working for 14.5 yuan an hour (£1.69). That’s £1 less than the £2.69 national average for a factory worker in China. Foxconn could not pay her so little in Shenzhen, where the legal minimum wage is 19.5 yuan an hour, or in Shanghai, where it is 20 yuan.Some days Alexa gets to work overtime. But when she opens her wage slip at the end of the month she will be disappointed, because she and her fellow dispatch workers are paid only the same 14.5 yuan rate that they get for the main shift, instead of the time-and-a-half stipulated by Chinese labour law and Amazon’s own supplier code of conduct.Foxconn promises agency workers a minimum of 3,700 yuan a month (£431.64), but pay slips and workers’ own accounts suggest real wages rarely get close to that figure. Most earn between 2,000 and 3,000 yuan, with permanent staff earning between 2,000 and 2,500 yuan. In 2017, the average wage for a worker in Hengyang was 4,647 yuan a month.Pay rates have rocketed in China in recent years, but Hunan remains one of the provinces with the lowest wages, and the minimum in Hengyang – 1,280 yuan a month – is barely half that in Shenzhen, where Foxconn’s Apple factory is based.That Shenzhen factory has been the subject of years of criticism for its treatment of staff manufacturing iPhones and other Apple devices – with 14 suicides in 2010 prompting the installation of netting around the factory dormitories to catch workers jumping from the roofs.Now rewind again, back to March. It is early evening and Alexa is getting off the bus and entering the factory for the night shift. She has secured a job as a dispatch worker through the Qizhong labour company – one of six supplying the factory – and has joined the production line making Amazon’s mini smart speaker, the Echo Dot.Alexa looks much like the other young women around her, but she has a secret. Alexa has been sent in undercover by the US-based labour rights investigator China Labor Watch to find out what is going on behind the security gate. It is the first time anyone has investigated Amazon’s production lines, and CLW has teamed up with the Observer (and the Sunday Mirror) to publish the findings. Its own report – Amazon Profits from Secretly Oppressing its Supplier’s Workers – is published online today.Alexa is early, like all the other workers. They know that they must leave time to clear security and be at their workstations for the 8pm start, though they won’t be paid for turning up early. She notices that the temperature inside the workshops is noticeably higher than outside and the anti-static gloves she has to wear quickly make her hands sweat.Every day when she returns to the company dormitory she shares with five other women, she jots down what she has seen in her diary: the monotonous work the colleagues complaining about sore backs and the bright lights that make their eyes tired the overwhelming sense of exhaustion. She notes that workers must ask permission from a supervisor to go to the toilet, and how some workers are left in tears when they are told off by their line manager.Today Alexa has to clean 1,400 Echo Dot speakers with a toothbrush dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove any specks of dust. Four-and-a-half hours into the shift, she is already flagging.“I was already so tired and my movements grew slower,” she writes later. “I brushed with less and less force. There were 20 or 30 speakers building up in front of me that I had yet to brush clean.“The speakers that remained to be cleaned kept building up in front of me. The line technician came over and told me to brush faster and that my movements were too slow … but I no longer had any strength.”Another day she chats to an older woman sitting opposite her.“The woman across from me said that she had been brushing for so long that her hand was growing numb, her neck was sore, her back was sore, her eyes couldn’t see clearly, and her vision was getting worse …”Another worker tells her she, too, is suffering: “While working at the same work position and doing the same motions over and over again each day, she felt exhausted and her back was sore and her neck, back and arms could barely take it any more.”Alexa’s diary makes no happier reading the following day. A woman of about 45 tells her how she has been scolded because she is not fast enough: “It might be because she was getting older so her speed was slower and her reactions were slower. When the line leader was telling her off, she started crying. After I returned to the dorm, an older woman … said that last time the line leader told her off, she also cried.”She describes long nights of repetitive and relentless work, with fellow workers close to falling asleep on their feet. During a break about midnight she sees that “many people were resting on the assembly line and sleeping, while others had pushed together some chairs and were sleeping on those. Some had even stacked together some foam boards and slept on top of them.”She finds little relief on returning to the dormitories, where she notes that there is no emergency escape plan in case of fire and “escape routes are unlabelled”. Workers complain about the living conditions, including leaks in the roof and lights in the showers not working.Alexa’s diary records her own frustrations on the production line and how she is overwhelmed by tiredness: “In my mind, I was both furious and lamenting as my hands continued the repetitive motions. My hands started feeling sore, but I managed to make it to 3am.“Around 4am, the workers across from me stopped working. I continued observing. The workers across from me told me I didn’t need to watch any more as the quota had already been reached. At this time, I saw that some of the people in the work positions behind us had also stopped and were sitting due to lack of work. I felt very tired so I rested my head on the assembly line. After a while, the line technician came over and tapped me and said I couldn’t sleep on the assembly line, so I sat up again.”At the end of the shift, Alexa leaves the workshop and goes to collect her phone from her locker: “There were a lot of people squatting or sitting on the kerbside, eating a boxed lunch or playing with their phones. They all looked exhausted.”Talk in the factory is of agency workers being laid off without pay during quiet periods: 700 in April and May, and 2,700 in January and February. Yet among the workers there is no great simmering anger, no burning resentment. Few have heard of Amazon or Bezos. They aren’t expecting very much and aren’t particularly disappointed when not very much is exactly what Foxconn and Amazon give them.One 32-year-old married man says he can earn a basic 2,000 yuan (£233) a month making Kindles, but even with overtime taking it up to around £315 it is not enough.“Currently, the wages are very low. I hope to be able to earn around 3,000 to 5,000 yuan a month. Though I doubt I can earn this on a consistent basis.” At least it is better than being a dispatch worker, he says. “The factory just fires them.”But a 19-year-old dispatch worker disagrees. He says he can earn 145 yuan a day if he works a couple of hours’ overtime and just accepts it when he is laid off: “The factory will schedule holidays for dispatch workers. Around half a month to a month. I just stay at home. It is OK.”“This violates Chinese labour law. Foxconn uses a large number of dispatch workers and violates workers’ interests via these dispatch companies. This practice is unethical and illegal,” he wrote.“I hope that you can compel your suppliers to improve their working situations and to manufacture Amazon products under ethical conditions.”But Amazon already knew this, because Alexa was not the only person running a ruler over the Foxconn factory in March. Amazon says that its own auditors also visited, and picked up “two issues of concern” – the high volume of dispatch workers and the illegal underpayment of overtime. Foxconn was told to fix it.Kara Hartnett Hurst, Amazon’s head of worldwide sustainability, responded to Li Qiang’s concerns, telling him: “Amazon takes reported violations of our supplier code of conduct extremely seriously. Amazon recognises our responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of factory workers manufacturing products for Amazon.”The company had, she said, a code of conduct for suppliers and it used independent auditors to inspect its suppliers, who were expected to respond to any issues identified.Last year, Bezos announced that he was considering a philanthropy strategy, “helping people in the here and now – short term – at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact”.Apparently short of inspiration and unable to think of anything close to home, he took to Twitter to ask for suggestions. Today’s report suggests he might have been better off just asking Alexa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8410570462ce5f64690446baa7f4be93a679707c/0_341_5147_3089/master/5147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdbd14f0f79894f367f1db4ef3e9e488","title":"uk should not legislate to control childrens use of technology says culture secretary","story":"Matt Hancock refuses to rule out law to protect minors online, but would stop short of French measuresThe UK culture secretary, Matt Hancock, does not allow his own children to have mobile phones and thinks none should have access to devices overnight, but would not follow the French government’s lead in legislating on the issue.Hancock, whose brief includes digital issues, said: “Keeping children safe online is mission-critical, and everybody has a responsibility.

So for instance, making sure that internet companies properly police their own terms and conditions is important.”He dismissed suggestions, however, that the UK government should intervene more directly to control the exposure of children to new technology as France has done. A 2010 law bans phones in classrooms, and the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has pushed further. From September, children under 15 will not be able to use phones on school premises at all.Laws governing children\u0027s relationship with technology vary around the world, and are rarely enforced. The de facto age for many online services is 13, set by the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in 1998, which prevents sites from targeting children, or knowingly allowing children to provide information online without parental consent. The burden of garnering that consent and the low returns for building services for children has meant, however, that providers tended to turn a blind eye to under-13s on their site, neither catering for them nor expending the effort required to police against their presence.That said, tech aimed more explicitly at children has blossomed recently, and legislation that aims to protect children from potential harm have also been passed. Schoolchildren in France are barred by law from using their phones in the classroom and, from September this year, from using their phones in school at all.Such laws are countered by efforts on the part of companies such as Facebook and Google to attract new users while they’re young. Facebook offers Messenger Kids, which allows children to speak to contacts vetted by their parents, while Google’s YouTube has a Kids app that offers copious parental controls and the ability to filter videos for all but the most child-safe content – although the filters, which are run by an algorithm,\u0026nbsphaven’t always been successful, prompting the company to\u0026nbspannounce a human-curated version\u0026nbspin April.Hancock does not think laws are appropriate in these areas. “In some places laws are required. In other places, it’s just that as a society we have to mature to make the most out of this technology, which is amazing and brilliant, rather than use it badly.“So, for instance, I think it’s really hard to parent in the digital age. It’s one of the hardest times to be a parent because there’s this new technology that often the children understand better than the grownups. And there aren’t norms of how we use it.Hancock is more outspoken, however, about regulating the internet in other ways. He reiterated his plans to implement legislation that would force social media companies to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms, and said Britain might go it alone if it was unable to establish an international coalition to support regulation.“We don’t rule out legislation,” he said. “It is best if this approach is done internationally, but it doesn’t have to be. Because ultimately, we need political accountability over an area of life where there is a huge amount of power in the hands of a small amount of people.”Hancock was speaking ahead of the launch of London Tech Week, which promotes digital industry in the capital.The prospect of higher penalties has led some social networks to tighten up their practices. Twitter decided as a result of the new rules to delete the accounts of anyone who had joined the service as a child at the time when the company did not ask for a birthdate to sign up, even if they are now an adult.The government has offered little detail about what form its future social media legislation might take. Speaking to the BBC in May, Hancock said it may involve fines for companies that fail to act on bullying and harassment on their platforms, with a scale equivalent to that of the GDPR."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b5a5bfd0ca9f819494c5e894690496fc5eef00d/0_231_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b55e274be695b88c99cfde34011bdf","title":"poldark review a tricky love triangle with passion politics and bare chests","story":"It’s pecs v poetry, fab abs v the gift of the gab as the new Cornish-set series goes up against Love Island for Sunday-night viewersHere he comes, seen against the light from below, an Adonis furiously front-crawling through the waves. Naked. Well, not quite, but the shorts are skin-coloured. The imagination isn’t quite given the evening off. He emerges through the surf, glistening, heaving, magnificent. Poseidon? No trident. Daniel Craig, then? No, but could this be a come-and-get-me call? Not to you– calm down – to the 007 franchise.It is Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark, of course. Let the objectificationsexism debates begin. Actually, they already have, the usual ones, #MenToo. Anyway, now that it is up against Love Island, how could Poldark compete as the nine o’clock Sunday evening family entertainment if Aidan kept his top on. It is the battle of the abs. And a reminder to me – I’ll be heading down that way for the annual summer hol, and I’m not quite #BeachBodyReady. Drastic action is needed if I’m to emerge heroically from the ocean like Ross.Anyway, Demelza (Eleanor Tomlinson) is on the beach, too, her magnificent chestnut mane dancing in the sea breeze. And, not ready to pass the towel to her dripping husband, she is standing with – staring into the eyes of – another man. Hugh Armitage, remember, the pretty, wounded war hero and writer of dreary, whiny love poetry – “Lips to my lips unfoldTale of our love is toldHallowed by sea and sandBeauty was in my hand …” Actually, it was composed by Poldark creator Winston Graham, it seems. Really, Demelza? You fell for that?So, now there is the tricky love-triangle situation, plus Demelza’s suspicions that Ross has been getting rejiggy with Elizabeth (Heida Reed). It pretty much is Love Island, no? Pecs v poetry, fab abs v the gift of the gab. This has (a few more) clothes, bigger clothes, somewhere-down-there-south-westish accents, stirring strings and a sea that doesn’t go all the way around. Love Peninsular, perhaps.Ah, Demelza and Hugh aren’t really there, it’s just Ross’s mind playing tricks. Hugh and his threat haven’t gone away, though. Ross is going to need to up his game if he is to hang on to her.Here is the real Demelza, coming down the dunes with kids. “We saw you swim away,” she says. “No, I’m still here,” he replies, smiling. “And I.” Back on, just. Thank God. I couldn’t bear it if they weren’t together. Poldark is very good at bringing out the romantic teenager in you.It’s not just Love Peninsular, of course. This barnstorming fourth-series opener brims with passion and incident, politics and social history, some of which may even reflect the reality of the late-18th century. It is 1796 and Pitt the Younger has dissolved parliament and called an election. Hugh will stand if he lasts that long.In these times of financial uncertainty, grain is being shipped to Portugal while the locals starve. A group of angry, hungry miners march on Truro quay. There is a fight a man is killed. The dastardly George Warleggan (Jack Farthing) has three of them – Jago Martin, plus Demelza’s brothers, Drake and Sam Carne – prosecuted for murder, swiftly and unfairly tried and sentenced to hang. This is your time, Ross, for a speech at the scaffold to get them a reprieve. “One moment!” he cries, as the nooses are adjusted. And he delivers – it is brilliant, passionate and persuasive. Good work, Ross (and Aidan) – reprieve time, surely. For Drake and Sam, yes. Yes! But for Jago … No, the box he is standing on is kicked away, he falls and swings. “Noooooooo!” wails his father. “Noooooooo,” echoes around the nation’s living rooms. Is that Sunday night family entertainment? Nooooooo! You don’t get that in Love Island – a well-hung gag would be inappropriate here. It is a powerful, poignant, devastating scene. Poldark is more than heaving chests and violins (way too much of them, btw). And perhaps some good will come of it – it will finally spur Ross into getting into politics. He will come galloping and front-crawling to the rescue of the people in times of injustice, political and financial uncertainty.Incidentally, where – in these current times of uncertainty and injustice, 222 years on – is our Ross Poldark. Hang on, here he comes, against the light from below, emerging from the sea, dripping wet and semi-naked? An adonis, another one, Andrew Adonis ... No, it’s just not working.

Greece’s deputy defence minister, Fotis Kouvelis, told the : “We are enforcing the greatest possible measures to secure their safety in a place which for obvious reasons will remain unknown. We haven’t forgotten what happened in our region a few months ago.”Kouvelis was referring to the enforced removal from Kosovo of six Turkish citizens also denounced as followers of the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara has blamed for orchestrating the putsch.Tensions over the eight men, who flew into Greece on a Black Hawk helicopter a day after the failed coup, have added to an increasingly fiery campaign ahead of snap presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkey on 24 June. Friction with the west has escalated as the race appears to have tightened. At the weekend, Erdoğan accused Austria of fomenting a religious war between “cross” and “crescent” after it shut down overseas-funded mosques and raised the prospect of expelling Turkish Muslim clerics. But Greece has been the focus of growing animus in Ankara. Turkey has consistently argued the eight men were involved in the putsch against Erdoğan, which left 250 people dead and more than 2,000 injured. The Greek supreme court has rejected any notion of sending the men back, saying they would not get a fair trial in Turkey, where a purge of the military and civil establishment continues.In April, the council of state, Greece’s highest administrative court, granted one of the eight commandos permanent asylum, despite objections by Alexis Tsipras’s leftist-led government. Similar judgments are expected to follow when verdicts are issued in the remaining cases. The men, who deny involvement in the coup, were moved to the secret location when the 18-month period they were legally allowed to be held in detention expired last week. Kouvelis said: “We have an independent justice system which applies EU laws, international laws. It’s not something we can ignore. We have to listen to it.” Media reports on Sunday suggested the commandos were at risk of being abducted and assassinated. The newspaper Ta Nea reported that 80 police officers, including snipers, had been seconded to protect the Turks. Kouvelis said air and sea violations by Turkish forces in the Aegean Sea had increased, with Turkey dispatching warships to its western shores facing Greece.“A lot of ships have been transferred to the area and we are talking about fighter jets moving at crazy speeds, which raises the possibility of an accident,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61ac3a0f33952295801eb478444e6b43d94c0261/0_225_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc3ae4212c95fd67b3389835dcc9db7c","title":"north korea summit explainer","story":"The event will be historic but the path to a meaningful agreement is strewn with obstaclesThe on-again off-again summit between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will take place on 12 June in Singapore, the first time a sitting US president will meet the head of the isolated state. It is a high-stakes bid to try to solve the issue of nuclear weapons that has dogged four US presidents.After fiery rhetoric between North Korea and the US last year, Kim declared in his New Year’s address that the country’s weapons program was complete. He then launched a charm offensive with South Korea, using the Winter Olympics to send high-level officials to meet the South’s president, Moon Jae-in.Those contacts culminated in a summit between Moon and Kim in April at a border village and a joint declaration that both leaders were committed to “complete denuclearisation”. Moon then brokered direct talks between US and North Korean officials, and when a senior South Korean official said Kim wanted to meet Trump, the impulsive US president reportedly accepted on the spot.Kim Jong-un: The 34-year-old leader of North Korea who has incredible power and will benefit from simply meeting Trump. It will confer a sense of legitimacy on his rogue nation.Donald Trump: The mercurial US president who is looking for a major win after an administration dogged by scandals and stalled legislative efforts at home.Moon Jae-in: While the South Korean president may not be travelling to Singapore, his liberal government – elected after the downfall of his conservative predecessor –has been a major driver of rapprochement with the North.Mike Pompeo: Washington’s top diplomat has been on the front line of salvaging the meeting and is the most senior American to meet Kim Jong-un.Kim Yong-chol: The septuagenarian is the North’s top nuclear negotiator and former spymaster, he has focused on US policy for decades and was an adviser to both Kim Jong-un’s father and grandfather. The Trump-Kim meeting is squarely centred on convincing North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal. In a New Year’s address Kim stated the country’s weapons development was complete in the wake of the most powerful nuclear detonation, in September 2017, and missile tests that could theoretically hit the US mainland. On Monday, North Korea’s state media said the pair would discuss a “permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism” on the Korean peninsula, denuclearisation of the peninsula and other topics of mutual concern.There are other major issues the international community would like to address, including North Korea’s stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons and the country’s dismal human rights record. But those are unlikely to be brought up directly by Trump.Both sides have traditionally had radically different definitions of the word “denuclearisation”. For the US, it means Pyongyang would immediately dismantle its weapons program, ship nuclear warheads out of the country and allow international inspectors to verify the results. In diplomatic speak this is known as complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement, or CVID for short. North Korea likely envisions a staged process, where each concession from Pyongyang is met with something from Washington. Sanctions relief, economic aid, a formal peace treaty to end the 1950-53 Korean war and formal diplomatic ties could all be potential sweeteners to any deal. In the protocol-heavy world of diplomacy, everything is imbued with meaning. There was talk of holding the talks at Panmunjom, the “truce village” on the border between North and South Korea, but American officials worried it would be interpreted as the US being too accommodating of Kim.Singapore has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, and can be seen as a nominally neutral party. When he announced the summit was back on, Trump said: “We’re not going to sign something.”He refused to comment on possible sanctions relief for North Korea, but added: “I look forward to the day when I can take the sanctions off North Korea.” He also said additional economic restrictions were ready to be implemented should the talks fall apart. Kim is likely looking for some sanctions to be lifted as he tries to improve the North’s economy.There have been reports Kim and Trump could declare a formal end to the Korean war, which ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty. But that might be complicated by the fact China would probably need to sign off on any agreement, since it was a signatory to the armistice pact."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525739.1528657727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ncad and iadt merger recommended in new plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFiona Nevin from Kildare with her metalwork jewellery creation at the NCAD Graduate Exhibition 2018. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe aim is to boost collaboration across the creative arts in higher education and enhance the sector’s potential to attract lucrative research funding.The merger is one of five key recommendations in a report on the future of arts education commissioned by the Higher Education Authority (HEA).While Ireland has built a strong reputation internationally on the strength of the work of inidual artists, most experts believe the sector as a whole has punched below its weight. Many feel this is due to a lack of joint action across education institutions involved in the creative arts.The NCAD, which offers the largest range of art and design degrees in the State, has about 1,000 full-time and 600 part-time students. The IADT, which has about 2,500 students, specialises in areas such as film, TV, creative media technology and production design. It is understood the report is being issued to both institutions for their feedback and is due to be published later this year.A spokesman for NCAD said: “We are aware through ongoing discussion with the HEA about a number of potentials that have been proposed, but as we have not received the specific report you refer to, we cannot comment.”Dr Annie Doona, president of IADT, said: “Anything that enhances IADT’s reputation as the leading provider of third-level education in the creative, art and design sectors is welcomed.”A potential merger into a university would boost the standing of the Dún Laoghaire college, whose status is similar to that of an institute of technology. It is not involved in any consortium which is seeking to secure technological university status.The NCAD, on the other hand, already has strong links with UCD. It formed a strategic alliance with the university in 2010. At one point there was speculation that NCAD and UCD could merge, though this never materialised."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

baby boomers set inherit 100k","story":"On average people currently aged 55-64 have built up wealth of a quarter of a million poundsChildren of the Baby Boomer generation are set to inherit £100,000 each on average, analysis shows, although they will not receive the money until they are in their 60s.On average people currently aged 55-64 have built up wealth of a quarter of a million pounds, the vast majority of which they are unlikely to spend, a report published today by the Institute of Fiscal Studies says.The conclusion, which was reached by analyzing 15 years of pensioners\u0027 saving and spending habits, dispels fears that younger generations\u0027 inheritance is likely to be squandered by their parents or eaten up in care fees. The news is likely to come as a relief to younger generations, who are suffering from a cocktail of economic misfortunes including high student loan repayments, low wages, high housing costs and relatively poor pension provision. The IFS said that the median non-pension wealth owned by households on the cusp of retirement was £250,000. Most of this was made up of housing wealth, with a small proportion in savings and investments.It said baby boomers were unlikely to spend the vast majority of this sum, meaning it would be eventually be bequeathed. Based on each household splitting the sum between two children, each child would receive over £100,000 free of inheritance tax. How much can you pay into your pension? | Contribution limits for the tax year 2018-19However due to longer life expectencies meaning people are commonly living into their 80s and 90s, they are likely to be waiting until well into their sixties before inheriting any money.Primary housing is the largest component of non-pension wealth held as eight in ten over 50s are home owners, with one in six 55-64s owning a second home, the IFS said.On current trends, the majority home owners at age 50 would not be expected to move before of they die. Of the slightly over two-fifths who would be expected to move, few move for financial reasons, the IFS said.   In addition it said financial wealth is on average drawn down, but only slowly. Observed behaviour suggested that on average iniduals will draw down just 31 per cent of net financial wealth between ages 70 and 90. Rowena Crawford, associate director at the IFS and author of the report, said: “Older people do not draw on their wealth much during retirement.The majority of homeowners do not move or access their housing wealth, and even financial wealth is drawn down only slowly. This means that most wealth held by retired people is likely to be bequeathed to future generations, rather than spent.This will have implications for the level and distribution of resources among current working age iniduals, particularly those with wealthy parents and few siblings.Given the increased freedom people now have over how they spend their pension wealth in retirement, carefully monitoring how the use of wealth evolves in future will be important, both for the living standards of the retirees themselves, and also for younger generations.”Robert De Niro uses F-bomb against Donald Trump on live TV during Tony AwardsComment: Love Island proves that the art of conversation is not dead yetThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendDonald Trump attack on G7 allies was show of strength ahead of Kim Jong-un summit, claims aideDigital and social media firms should be forced to protect children from addiction, experts sayAfghan interpreters to be granted visas following Government reviewDozens of patients flee fire in NHS hospital as 58 firefighters called to tackle the blazeThe UK has too many biology and history graduates and not enough workers with vocational skills, say peersRight to Buy scheme could collapse because Britain is running out of council houses\u0026#34Carebots\u0026#34 could take over from NHS medics to save £13bn a yearScottish Government pledge to double free childcare \u0026#39at risk\u0026#39 as private nurseries face \u0026#39crisis\u0026#39Nearly half of train operators misleading passengers over compensation rights Half of premature births could be avoided with simple bacteria test Graduates can become detectives in 12 weeks without having to walk the beatNHS doctors who make \u0026#39honest mistakes\u0026#39 to get more protectionMajority of schoolchildren buy takeaway for lunch at least once a week, child obesity study finds Theresa May urges Brexit rebels to \u0026#39send a message to the country\u0026#39 by staying united in key votes this weekPatrick Melrose, episode 5, review – this supreme drama was a headlong triumph in every departmentPoldark, series 4 episode 1 review: that tongue-in-cheek entrance was well worth itEuropean allies condemn Donald Trump for undermining G7 with \u0026#39fits of anger\u0026#39Lost generation: the children losing their childhood to social media We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/10/TELEMMGLPICT000165967684_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4YSnuoebJVzqhPY-8ji1gwskqU79aJCz2V_6OYccbo8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"george charlotte come play polo","story":"Princess Charlotte gets a cuddle from the Duchess of Cambridge while Prince George plays with a SlinkyWatching one’s father play polo is not the most exciting activity for most under-fives, but the Duke of Cambridge’s eldest children found plenty of ways to beat the boredom on a sun-soaked family day out yesterday.While the Duke competed in a tournament at the Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucestershire, Prince George and Princess Charlotte slipped off their shoes and chased each other around the edges of the field.Charlotte, aged three, showed off her roly-poly technique by tumbling on the grass, while George, who will be five next month, mimicked his father by hitting balls with a miniature polo mallet.George is reportedly left-handed, like his father, but polo players are only allowed to hold the mallet in their right hand - a lesson George already appears to have been taught as he whacked balls right-handed under the watchful eye of his mother the Duchess of Cambridge.Family day out: Prince William was playing at the Beaufort Polo Club while his family looked onHe had also brought along a colourful plastic Slinky toy, which he swished through the air behind him, and other toys including a water pistol with which he duelled with a friend.At one point it all seemed to have got a bit much for Charlotte, who retreated to her mother’s lap for a much-needed cuddle.The Duchess, wearing a blue Zara dress and Russell \u0026amp Bromley wedges, also had to console George at one point as he seemed to become tearful.The Prince and Princess were joined by their cousin Savannah Phillips - who had put a hand over George’s mouth to stop him giggling on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on Saturday - and her sister Isla.Savannah, seven, has clearly developed a close bond with her cousins, as she was pictured with her arm around Charlotte as the children all sat on a grass slope together.Take aim: Prince George\u0026#39s attention wavers from the poloThere was no sign, however, of the latest addition to the family, Prince Louis, who was born a month ago and was being looked after at home.The Duke was taking part in the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy to raise money for The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and CentrePoint.Duchess of CambridgeRobert De Niro uses F-bomb against Donald Trump on live TV during Tony AwardsComment: Love Island proves that the art of conversation is not dead yetThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendDonald Trump attack on G7 allies was show of strength ahead of Kim Jong-un summit, claims aideDigital and social media firms should be forced to protect children from addiction, experts sayAfghan interpreters to be granted visas following Government reviewDozens of patients flee fire in NHS hospital as 58 firefighters called to tackle the blazeThe UK has too many biology and history graduates and not enough workers with vocational skills, say peersRight to Buy scheme could collapse because Britain is running out of council housesChildren of baby boomers \u0026#39set to inherit £100k each\u0026#39\u0026#34Carebots\u0026#34 could take over from NHS medics to save £13bn a yearScottish Government pledge to double free childcare \u0026#39at risk\u0026#39 as private nurseries face \u0026#39crisis\u0026#39Nearly half of train operators misleading passengers over compensation rights Half of premature births could be avoided with simple bacteria test Graduates can become detectives in 12 weeks without having to walk the beatNHS doctors who make \u0026#39honest mistakes\u0026#39 to get more protectionMajority of schoolchildren buy takeaway for lunch at least once a week, child obesity study finds Theresa May urges Brexit rebels to \u0026#39send a message to the country\u0026#39 by staying united in key votes this weekPatrick Melrose, episode 5, review – this supreme drama was a headlong triumph in every departmentPoldark, series 4 episode 1 review: that tongue-in-cheek entrance was well worth itEuropean allies condemn Donald Trump for undermining G7 with \u0026#39fits of anger\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/25/TELEMMGLPICT000161496270_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"majority schoolchildren buy takeaway lunch least week child","story":"A shop advert shows fried chicken meals for £1Most children are buying takeaway for their lunch at least once a week, according to a new study from the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF).The research found that 60 percent of 11 to 16-year-olds said they bought food such as chips or fried chicken from takeaways at lunchtime or after school at least once a weekTakeaways are too readily available to children, the BNF has warned, pointing to the results of the survey.The study also found that 48 per cent of primary school students and 39 per cent of secondary school students reported eating three or more snacks a day.While fruit was the most popular snack among the majority of primary and secondary school students,  this was closely followed by less healthy options, with almost half of children aged 7 – 11 years saying they snack on crisps (46 percent) and chocolate (46 percent). The survey revealed that many children do not enjoy eating healthily, with 36 percent reporting that they don’t like healthy foods, 20 percent saying that healthy foods are boring and 12 percent not sure what the healthiest foods are.The Daily Mile: Is this the solution to the child obesity crisis?Roy Ballam, BNF’s Managing Director and Head of Education, said: “While it’s encouraging that children are motivated to eat well, many of the children we surveyed also said they didn’t like the taste of healthy foods or thought they were boring.This is where education about nutrition, cooking and food provenance can play a key role in helping children understand and get familiar with the foods that make up a healthy diet. With snacks, sugary drinks and takeaways readily available to many children on their way to and from school we need to do all that we can to educate young people about eating well.“While our survey showed that parents are the first port of call when children are concerned about health it’s also vital that we support teachers to deliver evidence-based and engaging information to children about food and nutrition. Many teachers may actually get little training in nutrition and addressing this is key to ensuring the quality of food education in schools.Figures released earlier this year showed that more than 50 per cent of children were overweight or obese upon leaving primary school in some areas.Camberwell Green in South London was revealed as the only neighbourhood where more children have a BMI of 25 or above than are healthy, according to Public Health England.This area of London is full of takeaway shops that children flock to after school, with head teachers warning The  of the £1 “school kids offer” local chicken shops are using to draw in students after school.Please review our commenting policyRobert De Niro uses F-bomb against Donald Trump on live TV during Tony AwardsComment: Love Island proves that the art of conversation is not dead yetThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendDonald Trump attack on G7 allies was show of strength ahead of Kim Jong-un summit, claims aideDigital and social media firms should be forced to protect children from addiction, experts sayAfghan interpreters to be granted visas following Government reviewDozens of patients flee fire in NHS hospital as 58 firefighters called to tackle the blazeThe UK has too many biology and history graduates and not enough workers with vocational skills, say peersRight to Buy scheme could collapse because Britain is running out of council housesChildren of baby boomers \u0026#39set to inherit £100k each\u0026#39\u0026#34Carebots\u0026#34 could take over from NHS medics to save £13bn a yearScottish Government pledge to double free childcare \u0026#39at risk\u0026#39 as private nurseries face \u0026#39crisis\u0026#39Nearly half of train operators misleading passengers over compensation rights Half of premature births could be avoided with simple bacteria test Graduates can become detectives in 12 weeks without having to walk the beatNHS doctors who make \u0026#39honest mistakes\u0026#39 to get more protectionTheresa May urges Brexit rebels to \u0026#39send a message to the country\u0026#39 by staying united in key votes this weekPatrick Melrose, episode 5, review – this supreme drama was a headlong triumph in every departmentPoldark, series 4 episode 1 review: that tongue-in-cheek entrance was well worth itEuropean allies condemn Donald Trump for undermining G7 with \u0026#39fits of anger\u0026#39Lost generation: the children losing their childhood to social media We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"view from top peter mckay veeam cyber security sales cycling","story":"‘It’s about coordinating, putting all the pieces together’Peter McKay, Veeam co-ceo, started his business career aged seven, cutting grass. He used to haul the mower around on the back of his bike. He was in high demand among the gardens of his Boston neighbourhood. “I loved the look of a freshly mown lawn, the smell of cut grass, I loved landscape.” And he was already something of a perfectionist. “It’s all about the lines.” He didn’t just cut grass, he sculpted it, he redesigned lawns, he came up with patterns years ahead of their time. “I used to pick up the mower and carry it so as not to spoil the pattern.”McKay doesn’t cut grass so much these days, but he still gets on his bike. I cycled over to Dorchester to interview him. His first question was, “did you wear your helmet?” Sadly not. But I reckon I might go and get one now. McKay really is an ace salesman. His concern for my well-being got to me. Not to mention his story about how a helmet had saved his life. “In spring, in Boston, you get sand on the corner of the roads but it’s like black ice. I took a bend and I went over and I just kept on sliding and ended up under a car at a stoplight. The helmet cracked but not my skull.” He also had to shout out, “don’t drive – I’m under your tyre!”  Veeam (pronounced “veem”) does for your data what the helmet did for McKay. Provides cyber security, protection in an emergency. It does more, it stops you crashing in the first place. To coin a phrase, it enables you to take back control, safe from malware and hackers. If I was an information-rich company, I’d probably want to have a word with these guys.McKay flies between continents, but he’d rather be back on the saddle. “Everybody needs a vice,” he says. “This is mine.” He owns a grand total of eight\u0026nbspbikes and now builds his own from scratch. His wife told\u0026nbsphim that he has to ret rid of one before he can buy another. “I have to hide it so she can’t find it,” he says, reluctant to let a single one leave him. “Those bikes mean more to me than they would to anyone else.”McKay was the fifth of six kids and they had one car, so he had to get on his bike. He cycled to school and to football practice. Now he persuades Veeam employees to get on their bikes too. They have 3,400 employees and a hardcore bike team has sprung up. “I want them all cycling to work. It’s great for the community and it’s healthy. There’s no excuse.”McKay runs, he works out and he doesn’t play golf. He eats right too. “Except for that bacon this morning. I’ll have to burn off the calories on the bike.” He inspires largely through example. Together with boundless and infectious enthusiasm. Even his once sceptical wife has been “converted” to the joy of cycling too.McKay compares what he does as ceo\u0026nbspto getting everybody on two wheels. “A lot of it is motivating people to do what they wouldn’t normally do – and enabling them to get the most out of it – while\u0026nbspenjoying it along the way.” McKay stresses that “it’s not about leading – it’s about coordinating, putting all the pieces together.” It’s never about one guy, it’s all about the team. “We start together and we finish together and we party at the end of it.”The young McKay got into numbers early on and studied finance at college before going\u0026nbspinto accountancy. His epiphany came when he realised that the cheques he was writing to the salesmen were far bigger than his own. So he went into sales. And loved it. “I was selling solutions to who I once was.” A salesperson, he says, has to have both drive and empathy and lots of both. “A secondhand car salesman has drive, but he’s usually low on empathy.” Sales is all about understanding someone else’s problems “and then showing them how they can be solved through the leverage of software”. Interestingly, he thinks a salesperson is born rather than made. “You can improve. You can be a good salesperson. But there is some kind of sales gene. You’ve either got it or you haven’t.”McKay branched off into technology, worked for companies little and large, joined Watchfire, an IBM\u0026nbspspin-off, then VMware, an $8bn (£6bn) corporation. “Hypervisor” – “the biggest technological enhancement since Windows” – brought him to Veeam, data management specialists, whose raison d’être is to enable you to get control of your own data and stop anyone else from getting it. To bring order where there was chaos (now known as “hyper-sprawl”).While cycling McKay often puts on his headphones and listens to audiobooks. On an epic ride he can listen to a whole Ken Follett novel. But he is a particular fan of biographies and autobiographies. He likes to find out what people like Vanderbilt, Carnegie and Rockefeller, having made a pile, did with it all. “When you ride off into the sunset, you want to know you’re leaving the world a better place.” I should stress, in case anyone is worrying about him, he still looks in good nick to my eye: approaching 55, he is fit and slim and boyish in an open-necked shirt and fairly crackles with energy.And all this despite having just cycled 100 miles. The Veeam team biked from Boston to Cape Cod, from the JFK library to the Kennedy Compound and raised $64k for a good cause, Best Buddies, which is nonprofit organisation\u0026nbspfor children\u0026nbspwith disabilities. “You have to love what you do,” says McKay. And he still loves it. His only regret is that he never did the Tour de France. “I needed to get into racing earlier, instead of cutting grass.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But in many cases, students were given warnings, fines or asked to apologise.In one case at Queen’s University Belfast, a student accused of Islamophobia was asked to write a 3,000 word reflective essay as punishment.Ilyas Nagdee, NUS black students’ officer, said that stories of perpetrators getting away with a “slap on the wrist” had meant many students were being put off from complaining about racism. “They don’t believe that they will actually see the justice they want to see,” he said.Of the universities contacted, around a third did not share the details of alleged racist incidents, with many citing the sensitive nature of the information. Meanwhile, some universities did not provide any information because they said they did not record incidents under the category of ‘racist’.Overall, there was not one consistent approach to recording the data – with some universities citing they only had access to formal complaints, rather than allegations raised through other outlets.James Kingett, from Show Racism the Red Card, said he was “concerned” by the rise and he added that it was “troubling” to hear of inconsistencies in terms of reporting across universities. \u0026nbspHe said: “Transparency of reporting is essential so that students and staff understand how incidents are defined, investigated and resolved.”The rise has come as hate crime incidents have increased across the country, showing that universities and education are not immune. “Incidents of racism are on the rise across the country and the developing body of evidence can no longer be ignored,” Mr Kingett said.Mr Nagdee added: “The first step has to be universities taking ownership and recognising the issue because until we do that, universities will continue to be perceived as liberal places of tolerance when unfortunately all the data, all the stories and all the evidence is telling us this is not the case.”On the figures obtained by The Independent, he added: “I am sure the total number of racist incidents is much much higher. I wouldn’t be surprised if the numbers are even higher in the future.”A recent social media campaign from the NUS saw more than 100 students come forward with stories of racism on campus across 30 universities in just one week – with some saying they were worried about their safety. “This is a daily reality for students across the country,” Mr Nagdee said.And students appear to be using social media more and more to report racist incidents, rather than through the formal university channels, in order to ensure action is taken as quickly as possible.\u0026nbspA student from Nottingham Trent pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment in court last month, after a student posted a video of him making racist chants outside her room on social media.And this year, Sheffield Hallam University began an investigation after a student tweeted that library staff had called him a monkey. It came after a banana was reportedly thrown at a black Sheffield Hallam graduate during an ice hockey game between his alma mater and the University of Sheffield.The University of Sheffield was forced to apologise for an “unacceptable delay” in the handling of the incident – which involved one of its students – and it said it would review its proceedings.Sheffield was one of the institutions that saw a rise in the number of racist incidents in two years, according to the new data, from three reports in 2015 to 11 in 2017.But many students have found it difficult to report racist incidents. Melinda Acquah, a third year at Sheffield University, has experienced racism – but she has not formally reported any incidents.One of her former housemates used the “n word” around her – which made her feel “uncomfortable” and singled out as the only BME student in the house. “I didn’t know how to report incidents like this to the university. I didn’t know how to deal with it,” she told The Independent.And it is not only students that face racism. A racist note was left on a staff member’s desk at the Royal Veterinary College in 2017 – but they failed to identify the perpetrator, the data shows.Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University College Union (UCU), said: “A number of shocking incidents have made headlines recently and while universities obviously must not tolerate this kind of behaviour, they need to be more proactive in stopping it.“All universities must make it clear how staff and students can report any incidents and those that do make reports must be confident they will be properly supported.”Sam Gyimah, universities minister, said: “There is absolutely no place for any form of hatred, discrimination or racism in society. Universities have clear responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 in this regard. I expect institutions to act swiftly to investigate and address hate crime, including racist related incidents reported to them.”A Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said: “Universities UK’s Taskforce has published recommendations to universities on dealing with hate crime affecting university students.“A recent follow-up report recommended that each university should consider having one system to collect, record and store data on all types of hate crime at their institution.”She added: “Following this report and recent high profile cases, we are redoubling our efforts to identify the scale of race based hate crime in universities and how they prevent and respond to incidents. This project will establish what further action should be taken and continue to offer best practice guidance.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England.

He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.And a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It’s a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump\u0027Arron Banks, a major funder of the Brexit campaign, met with the Russian Ambassador to the UK three times in the run up to the EU referendum, it has emerged.The millionaire co-founder of Leave.EU also made repeated contact with Russian officials and flew out to Moscow to discuss business opportunities, according to reports.Mr Banks\u0026nbsphas previously said his “sole involvement with the Russians was a boozy six-hour lunch with the ambassador”, Alexander Yakovenko, in September 2015.Leaked emails now suggest there were further links between the Leave.EU campaign and Russian officials, according to\u0026nbspThe Observer\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspThe Sunday Times.Mr Banks and Andy Wigmore, the director of communications for Leave.EU, are said to have had a further lunch with the Russian ambassador in November 2015 – three days after they visited US president Donald Trump in New York with Nigel Farage.The ambassador introduced them to a Russian businessman who reportedly offered Mr Banks an opportunity to buy Russian goldmines and make a potential profit of several billion dollars, it is claimed.Mr Banks then visited Moscow in February 2016 to meet investors in the gold project.It is not clear if he put money into the deal, which was announced 12 days after the referendum, but he later tweeted he was “buying gold at the moment”.There was further contact in the run-up to the US election, during which Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore campaigned in support of Donald Trump.On Friday\u0026nbspthe pair\u0026nbspannounced they were pulling out of a grilling by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspafter claiming they were being targeted in a “co-ordinated witch hunt” of Leave groups.Mr Banks later said\u0026nbspthey would appear before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s fake news inquiry on Tuesday as planned.Mr Banks admitted that he handed over telephone numbers for members of Mr Trump’s transition team to Russian officials, according to The Sunday Times.However he denied that Russian officials sought to influence his Leave.EU referendum campaign.“I had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him,” Mr Banks\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp”Bite me.

Ms Cadwalladr rejected the allegation.In a statement, the Russian embassy said: “The Russian Embassy has not in any way intervened in domestic UK political process, including the Brexit referendum.

However,\u0026nbsparchaeologists\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspunsure about who it is supposed to represent.Due to the crown researchers assume the man is some member of royalty, but are unsure who he is or even what kingdom he would have ruled over.This location is very important because it suggests that the site may have shifted hands between these polities, more likely between\u0026nbspAram-Damascus\u0026nbspand Israel,\u0026nbspHebrew University archaeologist Naama Yahalom-Mack\u0026nbsptold , adding that\u0026nbspthe sculpture has a very interesting hairdo, which is similar to the way ancient Egyptians depicted Near Eastern peoples in their art.After being found by a volunteer digging at the site, curators at the Israel Museum made the uncommon move to put the piece on display almost immediately.Eran Arie, the museum’s curator of iron age and Persian archaeology, said of the discovery:\u0026nbsp“In the iron age, if there’s any figurative art, and there largely isn’t, it’s of very low quality. And this is of exquisite quality.”Ms\u0026nbspYahalom-Mack\u0026nbspmade some educated guesses as to who the man is, suggesting it could be either Ahab or Jehu of Israel, Ithobaal or Hazael of Damascus, or even\u0026nbspBen\u0026nbspHadad.However she was quick to point out that we\u0027re only guessing here.As the sculpture is only a head, archaeologists now plan to continue digging in the site to see if it was part of a larger piece.The archaeology\u0026nbspcommunity made another incredible discovery this week when\u0026nbspresearchers in China found the oldest\u0026nbspfootprints on Earth in the\u0026nbspYangtze Gorges which they believe are 550 million years old.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Bite me. It\u0027s a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.The insurance tycoon, who came to prominence when he donated \u0026pound1million to Ukip in 2014, said nothing came of the discussion about consolidating Russian gold mines into a single company.We didn\u0027t profit from any business deals because I never pursued anything, said Mr Banks, who has interests in South African diamond mining.The businessman, whose wife is Russian, said he made a family trip to Moscow in February 2016 but no meetings were had with anyone.He had also briefed US State Department officials about his meetings with the Russians, he said.Mr Wigmore insisted he and Mr Banks never any Russians information about their Brexit campaign.E-mails said to reveal the extent of the men\u0027s contacts with Russians were unveiled by journalist Isabel Oakeshott who ghostwrote Mr Banks\u0027 referendum memoir. She is now writing a book on Russia\u0027s attempts to influence British politics, said Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore were surprisingly willing tools of the Kremlin, and that she came forward after her email accounts were hacked.Mr Banks has now agreed to appear on Tuesday before the House of Common\u0027s Culture and Media committee\u0027s inquiry into fake news, having on Friday said he would not because the MPs were engaged in a witch hunt.Culture and Media Committee chairman Damian Collins Committee chairman Damian Collins, a Conservative MP, said the latest reports raised serious questions about possible Russian interference in UK politics.This is big news, because if the Russian government is seeking to develop relationships with prominent people like Arron Banks - not just a wealthy businessman but someone who\u0027s been the biggest private funder of political campaigns in this country, whose funding of Leave.EU played a central role in the build-up to the Brexit referendum and the referendum itself - I think we have a right to know what the level of that contact was, particularly when Mr Banks has sought to deny that, he told BBC1\u0027s Sunday Politics.At the moment what we know is he had more meetings than he let on.The MPs would also press Mr Banks on whether he profited from the meetings, and if he used the proceeds to fund his campaigns.Russia has a track record of interfering in the politics of other countries. It does it in a variety of ways. That is why it is important we understand the level of contact and involvement there was here.Asked in Canada at a summit of G7 leaders including Mr Trump but not Vladimir Putin about the latest claims, Theresa May said: I am sure that if there are any allegations that need investigation the proper authorities will do

Gregg, a geologist at the University at Buffalo, also noted studying volcanic history provides scientists with some indication of which volcanoes are more \u0026ldquooverdue than others.She said: We learn about a volcano\u0027s likely future behaviour by examining its past behaviour: We look at how often it has erupted in the past, and how big those eruptions were.The simplest thing to do is to assume that the volcano will continue to behave in the same way it always has.Mount Rainier poses a serious threat to the 3.7m residents in the Seattle areaHowever she warned little is known about the majority of the 550 active land volcanoes, and only those located near densely populated areas in first-world countries are regularly monitored.She said: Remember how Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991?\u0026ldquoUntil that volcano began showing signs of unrest - typically small earthquakes that are caused by magma moving beneath the volcano - no one had conducted a detailed geologic investigation of the volcano\u0027s past, so we didn\u0027t know what the volcano had done before.There simply isn\u0027t the time, people and money to monitor and study every active volcano.Devastating pictures show the damage and heartbreak after Fuego volcano erupted in Guatemala.                     REUTERS1 of 38BEFORE: La Reunion Golf Course and surrounding area in GuatemalaShe also warned many of the volcanoes which pose the greatest threat are those receiving the least monitoring, including Iwo Jima near Japan and Mount Tambora in Indonesia.In addition, Ms Gregg is concerned about Mount Rainier in Washington State, due to a large amount of glacial ice and the threat it poses to the 3.7million residents in the Seattle area and the Puyallup River valley.She said: It seems to have experienced potentially damaging eruptions every couple of thousands of years and its last hazardous eruption was about 2,200 years ago.\u0026ldquoHowever, even a small eruption of Rainier could cause significant damage to property.Yet Mr Edwards expressed his concern about Etna in Sicily, Veniaminof in Alaska, Klyuchevskoy in Russia, Villarrica and Llaima in Chile, and Katla and Hekla in Iceland.He said: These are all snowice-covered volcanoes that have a reasonable probability of erupting in the next 10 to 50 years.\u0026ldquoYou can bet that if any do erupt, I will do my best to head their way to study volcano-ice interactions!Despite the challenges scientists face in predicting volcanic eruptions, the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth\u0026rsquos Interior (IAVCEI) Decade Volcano Programme has identified the volcanoes which pose the greatest threat.Their list is based not simply on which volcanoes are most likely to erupt, but rather on which volcanoes are located within highly populated regions and also capable of producing lethal volcanic eruptions including lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars and ash falls.Hawaii volcano eruption 2018: Dramatic pictures as lava from the Kilauea volcano eruptions destroys over 40 homes in the area.

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I believe the horrifying murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May 2013 was a turning point.As the founder of Tell MAMA, I found myself in the unenviable position of having to mobilise my tiny team at the time to help the growing number of people being targeted at a street and online level by anti-Muslim hatred.The backlash was significant, given the targeting of a young soldier minding his own business and the brutal manner of the terrorist attack.In the aftermath, Ukrainian neo-Nazi Pavlo Lapshyn placed three bombs in mosques in Wolverhampton, Walsall and Tipton — two months after murdering Mohammed Saleem, a grandfather walking back home from his mosque in Birmingham.The past five years have seen no let-up in the UK.People acting alone and small insular cells of men, and increasingly women, have carried out attacks at London Bridge, in Manchester, Finsbury Park and Westminster Bridge.And let us not ­forget the multiple terrorist attacks on 7/7 and the attempted attacks on civilians on 21/7.Our country has had its fair share of local and national triggers for potential tensions, but the unique nature of British society has meant we have not seen riots on our streets, such as those in Oldham in 2001 — and this is something to be ­celebrated.Terrorist trigger points have clearly led to rises in anti-Muslim hate incidents and there have been points where our country has been under ­significant pressure.After 7/7 and the significant loss of life that took place then, Britain was on a heightened state of alert as another plot failed to deliver its deadly cargo and the police and security services were in a race to find members of that terror cell.Dubbed 21/7, the country was shaken, ­communities were fearful and there was a crackle in the air as some people aired their frustrations openly.Even after all of this, we as communities held together.There is therefore something unique in our country which means community violence has not broken out, whereas in other European ­countries there have been street clashes and the widespread intimidation of minority communities.That “uniqueness” in our country is based on the old tradition that is ingrained in our society — that of “live and let live”, and “fair play”.It also underscores that the space for the accommodation of ideas and new populations has been a fundamental and historic part of our country though today, with resource pressures, there are limits.However, this is not only one-way traffic, and a sense of pride and identity within groups such as Britain’s Muslims has shown itself time and time again.It is therefore important to note that while ­younger citizens are less proud to be English, poll after poll has shown that Muslims living here are more ­patriotic than the average Brit.This means many Muslims do feel pride in a country where they can worship freely, be who they want to be and have the ability to practice their faith how they want to.We also have to say what is patently obvious, that Muslims have more freedoms in the United Kingdom compared to their counterparts in ­mainland Europe, where veil bans, harassment and chronic unemployment blight Muslim and other minority communities.It is this freedom to worship without fear, allied to the British sense of fair play, that makes us a place many countries look up to.The fact is our futures are inter-related and will continue to be as people travel more and ­connect through social media.It also means many of our preconceptions of different communities will change over time.This can be a force for good, though hand-in-hand with this must be that there are a unique set of values in our country.They have held us together in the darkest moments and have strengthened our resolve to stand together. Of this, we can always be proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not just because it holds the economy back, but because it gives privatisation a bad name.Putting the railways back into public ownership would be a complete disaster, but it is no surprise that the idea is becoming more popular.Transport supremo Chris Grayling looks derailed. His decision to sign off Thameslink’s fines for this year before they’d even run the trains is barking.He needs to get our trains back on track.BRITAIN is in the grip of a crime wave and Sajid Javid must get on top of it.The Home Secretary’s first priority should be to listen to our Beat the Blades taskforce, who today lay out their manifesto for knife-free streets.A Government that doesn’t keep the public safe has failed its most fundamental duty.The build-up to the World Cup has been more political than ever.But it is time to put that to one side.

The Met Office long-range prediction system shows a slightly increased chance of high-pressure patterns across the UK.”The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The warmest summer since 2006 is a possibility, after recent years saw a series of disappointing summers.“The June to August period only needs to be 1C above average for it to happen.”Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Channel, owned by The Weather Company, said: “33C is expected by early July as heat from high pressure over Britain builds.”Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: “Theres plenty of sunshine to come this week, with the South generally fine through the week, although the North-West will be changeable from Wednesday.“There is a signal for a gradual return to more settled weather through the end of June. Temperatures are likely to be warmer than average, with the possibility of very warm or hot spells.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412284459.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hadlow tower kent tonbridge sale home price","story":"Grade I listed Hadlow Tower is nestled in the grounds of Hadlow Castle in Tonbridge, Kent.The stunning property has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a dining room, kitchen, drawing room and a media room.Standing 6ft taller than Nelsons column, it was built by wealthy merchant Walter Barton May in 1838 so he could spy on his estranged wife who left him for a local farmer.In 2013, The National Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage transformed the tower into a state of the art home in a £4.5million renovation.Current owner Christian Tym, who is selling the property after living there with wife Becca and four sons, described it as mysterious and marvellous.He said: Its a phenomenal place to live and my four boys love playing hide and seek inside!When you drive up to Hadlow Tower it cant help but put a smile on your face.Its a unique place to live and from the top there is nothing blocking your view so you can look out as far as the eye can see.I fell in love with Hadlow Tower at first sight and we are selling it with a heavy heart.He said it had been an amazing place to live but needed to sell it for private reasons.The tower was used as a look out during World War Two, but was saved by Royal painter Bernard Hailstone.The master bedroom, known as the Rapunzel Room, has its own roof terrace.The 3.45acre grounds boast a croquet lawn and an ornamental boating lake.At this time, Hadlow Tower was listed on the World Monument Funds 100 most endangered historic buildings.The tower was later sold to the Vivat Trust charity that preserves historic buildings, at the sum of £1.Special craftsmen carefully removed and replaced the intricate details of the towers stone work.The interior was modernised to such an extent, a lift was fitted and the master bedroom had its own roof terrace.James Mackenzie, head of Strutt \u0026amp Parkers National Country House Department described the tower as historically fascinating.He said: Hadlow Tower had £4.5million invested into it so it is both historically fascinating and brand new.It has the best of everything with incredible craftsmanship and every modern benefit.This tower is a masterpiece and weve already had dozens of enquiries about it including foreign buyers."},{"url":null,"title":"humpback whale port macqurie australia","story":"The mammal leaped from the water just inches from whale-watchers in Port Macqurie, Australia.Video shows the mammal spectacularly emerge from the surface of the water on Friday.The whale twists with its fins and tail before producing an almighty splash which drenched awestruck onlookers.The boat can be seen rocking and onlookers howling in shock at the display and their freshly-soaked clothes.Water is then seen shooting out of the whales blowhole in one final gesture to the admiring crowd.The whales are currently migrating from the Antarctic to the warmer waters of Australia.Several have been spotted along the east coast of Australia in recent weeks.The footage has been shared more than 160,000 times since being shared by Port Jet Cruise Adventures on Facebook.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I would have done the same even if they weren’t the biggest.“I feel really happy with my body, just the way it is right now - the opposite of how I felt in the past,” she said.While the Instagram star has loved Barbie dolls since her childhood, her cosmetic transformation began after she was bullied at school for being “ugly.”She said: “I wasn’t originally very pretty and I used to be bullied a lot. I like to look like a doll because I would like to look faultless.”But while she has gained thousands of fans online, her “plastic” look has also attracted critics.Paris said: “Other people’s opinions on my looks vary. Some find my appearance good, some don’t - which is of course understandable, because everybody has a different ideal when it comes to beauty.“In spite of that, I have a lot of support. From my grandma, for instance, though she isn’t happy with my appearance.”The model’s loving grandmother Doris Lemke, with whom she lives in Berlin, has cared for Paris after her many surgeries including her most recent boob job.After her granddaughter was bullied and left feeling deeply insecure, Doris agreed to pay for her first breast implants when she was just 18.Since her first breast op, Paris has had a nose job, procedures and fillers to change the shape of her face, and her second and third breast ops.The German beauty has forked out more than £35,000 to achieve her pneumatic, doll-like appearance.Her grandmother, Doris said: “I don’t agree with all the surgeries Paris has, but she expresses herself this way because she was bullied and now she wants to look different than she used to.”Paris currently has over 200,000 Instagram followers, and frequently posts lingerie-clad snaps from photoshoots, often garnering thousands of likes on the social networking site.As with many social media models, the curvaceous star said she receives some unsavoury requests from fans.She said: “I get numerous offers from men to meet me in exchange for money, sometimes very high amounts, but I reject them. I wouldn’t do such things.”While Paris says she will never say never to more surgery, she’s very content with her appearance for the time being.She said: “I’m really happy that my dream came true and everything is going the way it is for me right now.“I simply love to look completely artificial. My motto is ‘plastic is fantastic’."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/as-image-beach-muzz-2.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds largest skinny dip ireland guiness world record","story":"The women - all aged from their late teens to mid-80s - took over a secluded beach in County Wicklow in Ireland in the hopes of a charity record bid.Many of the 2,505 participants were cancers survivors who used the mass naked swim as a means to overcome self-confidence issues related to mastectomy scars.Organisers of the record-breaking stunt have hailed it “an empowering experience in the fight against cancer.”Collectively, the nude bathers smashed a record previously held by Australian skinny dippers in Perth - despite the water temperature being about 10 degrees colder in Ireland.The group of 2,505 women also managed to raise more than 275,000 Euros for Irish cancer charity, Aoibheanns Pink Tie.Organiser Dee Featherstone, who led yesterdays naked charge into the Irish Sea, said the numbers exceeded her wildest dreams.She said: I thought we might get 1,500 but it just got bigger and bigger.The whole beach was just awash with us - it was just incredible.Half the people who were there either had cancer or were affected by cancer or were supporting somebody or remembering someone who had cancer - every woman had their own little story of why they did it.It was very empowering.She added that a lot of women had been nervous about baring all, due to scars left by cancer operations.Dee said: On the day absolutely nobody cared and the people who would have been really scared and nervous about doing it - they were the ones who were in the water longest and naked longest on the beach.They went in one sort of women and came out another sort of women - everyone has said that to me since."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412219685-e1528666584467.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm needs to show some iron","story":"She will probably win vital Brexit votes in the House of Commons.But that won’t mean much if she can’t get a grip on her party and on our future outside the EU.

It is unbalanced in favour of one route, and as a result offers poor value for money to some individuals, taxpayers and the economy. It requires immediate reform.”Peers raised concerns about the decline of part-time learning in higher education, plus the drop of part-time study in further education, urging the introduction of a credit-based system for people to learn in a modular way.The EAC criticised the Government’s target of three million apprenticeships arguing it had “prioritised quantity over quality and should be scrapped”.It noted: “The lack of clear accountability for the delivery and quality of apprenticeships is unacceptable,” adding that the Institute for Apprenticeships should be abolished.The national accounts the committee said masked the true cost of higher education, adding: “A recognition of the write-offs in public spending at the time the loans are made would allow for a better discussion of where public money in post-school education should be directed.”It noted the Department for Education had forecast that the total student loan book would be worth £1.2 trillion in nominal terms (£473 billion in 2018/19 values by 2049-50).The report also recommended reforms to students loans and a widening of maintenance support and called for the interest rate to be reduced to the level of the 10-year gilt rate (currently around 1.5%) from the current rate of RPI plus 3%.Tory peer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee, said: “The way we expect students to access higher and further education is deeply unfair. We must create a single system, including apprenticeships, that offers more choice and better value for money.“Maintenance support should be available for all students studying at Level 4 and above. The means-tested system of loans and grants that existed before 2016 should be re-instated, and total support increased to reflect the true cost of living.”He added: “The accounting trickery attempted by the Government in 2012, in which the high rate of interest on student loans created the fiscal illusion that Government borrowing is lower than it actually is, has had a devastating effect on the treatment of students in England. It is unacceptable to expect future taxpayers to bear the brunt of funding today’s students.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hewill demand Britain continues to accept freedom of movement in exchange for unfettered access to Europe’s single market. But the Migration Watch think tank warned Mrs May that failure to curb EU migration after Brexit would destroy the Tory party’s credibility with voters.Its boss Lord Green said: “Controlling our borders must mean reducing immigration or it is pointless. 62% want to see a reduction in low skilled migration while 80% of EU migrants over the last ten years have been lower skilled. So any new arrangements must involve a sharp cut in immigration from the EU or the credibility of the Conservative government will be in shreds.”And Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful backbench European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the ambush would only backfire on the EU. He told The Sun: “If Brussels wants to do that it fails to realise why we voted to leave in the first place - it’s all about taking back control.“Clever ambushes are are yesterday’s story for the European Commission and they need to stop thinking along those lines. Their failure to do so is why Italy is unhappy, Hungary and so on. It’s a mindset that is actually turning nations against the European Union.”Meanwhile on Wednesday Home Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to announce the Government’s plans for the status of EU migrants already living in the UK. He has torn up plans by his predecessor Amber Rudd to offer preferential treatment to EU citizens after Brexit.Yesterday Labour frontbencher Andy McDonald said immigration could actually go up after Brexit. The shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said if businesses wanted more people to be allowed into Britain then the Government should allow that. His comments were described by one Tory MP as a “kick in the teeth for Brexit voters”.And his shadow cabinet colleague Sir Keir Starmer also hinted Labour is getting ready to U-turn on their pledge to end free movement.

Along with their wives and children, the figure granted asylum in the UK will be an estimated 200.But the relocation scheme will only affect those who served in Helmand, where the worst fighting took place during the war.The move follows a damning report by the Commons Defence committee earlier this year that found schemes to safeguard them from the Taliban after we left in 2014 “dismally failed to give any meaningful protection”.The report called for dangerously exposed interpreters to be brought to the UK.Announcing a review of the relocation scheme for Afghan interpreters, Mr Williamson writes in today’s Daily Mail: “Frontline patrol interpreters were the unsung heroes of the military campaign in Afghanistan.They served our nation with dazzling distinction. Standing shoulder to shoulder with our troops on the battlefield, they demonstrated unflinching courage in carrying out duties that were fraught with great difficulty and danger.And we will do what is right to honour their extraordinary service.The Defence Secretary added: ‘That is why after reviewing the scheme we are bringing forward plans to make it fairer and to make sure we deliver for those who were at greatest risk for the longest periods.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wonsan is one of several special economic zones in North Korea. It\u0027s a model similar to the one pioneered by China when it opened up in the late 1970s. In theory, there are several benefits.\"North Korea could conduct special policies and give all kinds of privileges to foreign companies to do business in that area,\" Prof Cheng said.\"Also, the special economic zones could help isolate this area from the other part of North Korea so North Korea could go ahead with some special arrangement with foreign economies.\"But reality - and North Korea\u0027s pursuit of the nuclear part of the Byungjin line - got in the way of the plan. \"You see in the past years North Korea has set up more than 20 special economic areas but they\u0027ve basically failed because of international sanctions - foreign companies aren\u0027t allowed to invest in the country.\"That\u0027s what Mr Kim wants from the summit: not economic aid from the US (North Korean statements have been scathing about that idea) but the opportunity to attract foreign investment. That requires sanctions being lifted.Dandong is a Chinese city on the China-North Korea border on the other side of the Yalu River is Sinuiju, another North Korean special economic zone. A single-lane bridge connects the two countries. Here we saw an uneven flow of trucks, trains and tourist make the journey across.Further along the river, there\u0027s an impressive new bridge. It was completed in 2015. Well, nearly. The North Korean side ends in a field, with no connection to a road. Dandong is primed for North Korean trade but it\u0027s currently on pause. We visited the main fish market, which used to stock plenty of North Korean seafood. Sanctions imposed in 2017 put an end to that, although China is said to have relaxed the ban recently. We were offered North Korean clams, which are prized for their sweetness.Residents are optimistic about the US-North Korean summit - and what it means for their wealth. Zhang Tong, an estate agent working at Moon Island, a complex of soaring towers, says the summit has accelerated sales.She gestures to the North Korean side, in full view from the balcony of one show home. \"In front of us, several years ago, there weren\u0027t too many buildings,\" she said.\"If North Korea develops well, I think the friendship between China and North Korea will go better. And the economy and trade between the two countries will develop better too.\"And Dandong\u0027s economy will develop better too.\"None of that comes without risk, though - not least for Mr Kim himself, both internationally and domestically.Prof Cheng said: \"This time, when North Korea tried to change its gears, to single mindedly focus on economic development - such changes met resistance from other North Korean elites.\"Recently Kim Jong Un sacked three military guys - and that\u0027s the indication it\u0027s not easy for North Korea to change its policy in very dramatic ways.\" Mr Kim\u0027s nuclear arsenal might appear to give him a position of strength but the reality is more precarious. He must deliver economic growth to preserve his rule.

Theresa May lives under the dark cloud of that rejection, her authority still irrecoverable.But the wider political consequences have been as equally profound. The purpose of this ostensibly unnecessary election was to liberate the prime minister\u0027s hands from her errant backbenchers, marginalise the House of Commons from the Brexit process and provide her with the flexibility she so craved.On all three counts it had the opposite effect. Far from freeing Mrs May, it has bound her to the shackles of the Commons\u0027 portcullis.As next week\u0027s parliamentary votes will demonstrate, she will find herself beholden to the benches to her front and behind.Every single member of parliament matters and will do so even more when and if a vote on the final deal takes place in the autumn.The election served to diffuse, not concentrate political power, especially with regards to Brexit.Ever since election night, Brussels hasn\u0027t just been dealing with Number 10 but in effect, the House of Commons too.Within that, power is further dispersed: the Tory Remain camp, the Tory Leave camp, the Labour frontbench, the Labour backbench, some to Edinburgh and SNP HQ, some to Belfast and the DUP.One of the clarion calls of the referendum was that parliamentary sovereignty must be restored.It is an irony that that restoration should come not as a result of the referendum, but from an election which left the executive denuded and a legislature enhanced. That legislature has since done all it can to soften many of the consequences of the referendum which prompted its election in the first place. Such are the odd ironies of political life and history.The election also muddled the political imperatives behind Brexit.It had been argued that the people\u0027s will had been expressed clearly and absolutely on 23 June 2016, and that that mandate was clear.But the 2017 general election confused that narrative. A government had gone to the people on a prospectus of a hard Brexit and specifically asked for a super-majority for its execution.The prime minister stood on the steps of Downing Street and said parliament was thwarting her and by extension the people\u0027s will and argued only total parliamentary dominance would nullify the problem.The electorate did not oblige, indeed, they reduced the prime minister\u0027s power. The House of Commons became more, not less, Remainer in composition.There were now two dual wills, expressed by the same people at different times, with apparently contradictory impulses and instructions. The electorate, it seemed, was confused. The Brexit process, accordingly, became as equally chaotic.It also put pay to any distinctly Mayite domestic political agenda.Think back to those salad days of the early May premiership. Grammar schools, a new interventionist industrial policy, talk of a vote on fox hunting - all have vanished.There is no majority for any of it, even with the DUP. Instead the tumbleweeds blow through the corridors of parliament and the order paper is covered with little ink.However, when the history books are finally written (and heaven help the historians who have to make sense of our era), perhaps they will focus less on the direct political consequences of the election inside the Commons but rather as an important signal and harbinger of the enormous changes taking place outside the chamber.The 2017 election threw up the playing board of traditional British party politics.As I sat there on election night, bizarre results came through. Kensington and Canterbury had gone Labour. Mansfield and Stoke South had gone Tory.At first we wondered if there was a glitch in the system. Rather, we soon realised, the glitch was in our own imperfect understanding of what was happening to the political world outside.In courting those voters, in casting a hard Brexit as the only one possible, she incurred the wrath of liberal Conservative Remain voters and the young.It cost her seats such as Bath, Warwick, Canterbury and her majority.On the day after the night before, as election geeks like me surveyed the new political landscape, what we saw was, for traditional students of British politics, a confusing sight.Old cast-iron rules of British political life seemed to have crumbled.Most strikingly, the class centres of gravity for both parties had shifted - 2017 showed that neither Labour\u0027s grip on the working class nor the Conservatives\u0027 grip on the professional middle class remained strong.Labour lost a huge number of working-class voters to the Tories and vice versa with the Conservatives losing lots of professionals to Labour.Some commentators suggested that that would prove a blip, that given it was a Brexit election, when that issue is settled, traditional voting behaviour will reassert itself.It is possible, but I am far from convinced.First, it\u0027s unlikely Brexit will, in some senses, ever be \"over\" as an electoral issue.Secondly, Brexit turbocharged party political class crossdressing but it had been happening for a while anyway, since at least 2010. The process appears to be speeding up, not slowing: the electoral data we have since 2017 has confirmed that hypothesis, not least the local election results.YouGov data published only this week shows the continued bleeding of Labour\u0027s working class support. Whisper it: Labour is getting posher and the Tories are going the other way.A realignment is taking place, not in one fell swoop as Mrs May had intended but instead, slowly, over time, in fits and starts.A wise man once said that every trend is a trend until it bends.However, the forces driving this trend, this rewriting of the parties\u0027 DNA are profound: the rise of the graduate class, technological changes, distaste with globalisation and the rise of identity politics.These politically flammable materials just needed a flame, provided by Brexit and the general election which flowed from it.Historians may well then look back to 2017 as a defining moment in the respective voter bases of both major political parties in the 21st century.In the meantime though, overall polling shows both parties more or less stuck on where they were in 2017. To coin a phrase, nothing has changed.That\u0027s despite the fact that the Conservatives have had a combination of Brexit civil war, Cabinet resignations roughly every six weeks, sex scandals, a minister negotiating her own foreign policy, a cough, a P45 and a dodgy set, Grenfell, Windrush and more besides, none of it has made any difference.If there were another election tomorrow, all the indications, including the local election results, indicate the result would be much the same.Blame has been attached to both Mrs May and especially Jeremy Corbyn for this failure to break through.Perhaps, however, that isn\u0027t fair. The pool of swing voters is just too small. Brexit has bound us in our respective party political boxes. It has helped create a British culture war.In these circumstances, it is increasingly difficult to persuade voters from the other party\u0027s bloc to come to your side.The result? Two zombie parties, lurching, ambling, groping towards the finish line, without success. We may therefore be stuck with a variant of the 2017 election and the contours it set on British politics for some considerable time to come.Someone, not long ago, asked me which was my favourite election of all time. After a moment\u0027s thought, I smiled and said: \"Easy, 2017.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit tycoon arron banks undisclosed","story":"NewsMinisters call for probe into Brexit tycoon Arron Banks\u0027 \"undisclosed\" meetings with Russian ambassadorLeave.EU founder has slammed allegations against him but ministers are backing call for an investigation into his \"boozy lunches\" with Alexander Yakovenko\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor23:53, 10 JUN 2018NewsMinisters have backed calls for a probe into lunches Arron Banks enjoyed with a Russian ambassador (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMinisters have backed calls for a probe into a claim millionaire Brexit campaigner Arron Banks had “undisclosed” meetings with Russia’s ambassador to Britain.

He said he and ambassador Alexander Yakovenko merely had a “cup of tea”, and two “boozy lunches”.  Mr Banks added he disclosed details of his contacts with the Russians to US officials and got no Russian money or backing for the Brexit campaign. Speaking at the G7 summit in Quebec, Theresa May said: “I am sure that if there are any allegations that need investigation the proper authorities will do that.” Emails seen by The Sunday Times showed Mr Banks met Mr Yakovenko on three occasions – having previously only acknowledged one encounter in 2015 – and made a visit to Moscow in February 2016 in the midst of the referendum campaign. Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also had lunch with the ambassador in November 2016 – just three days after they and Nigel Farage had met Donald Trump in New York following his victory in the US presidential election, it reported.  They were said to have been introduced to Mr Yakovenko by Alexander Udod, one of 23 suspected Russian intelligence officers subsequently ejected from the UK after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. The ambassador was said to have proposed a business deal that would have involved them in the consolidation into one company of six Russian goldmines. But Mr Wigmore told the paper: “We never offered any information to him (Mr Yakovenko) or any Russian any details of our (Brexit) campaign.” Meanwhile Mr Banks, when asked if he ever received Russian cash or assistance for Brexit, laughed: “No, of course not.

And it won\u0027t just make or break her premiership - it could have a huge difference to you, your family, and your everyday life. That\u0027s because in a string of votes, MPs will choose whether to carry on with the Prime Minister\u0027s current Brexit plan or make it much, much softer. Mrs May is pulling out all the stops to prevent a Tory Remainer revolt that would scupper her Brexit talks, and leave Britain closer to the EU. The drama will take place on Tuesday 12 June and Wednesday 13 June.  It\u0027s all centred around 15 amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill , which is Mrs May\u0027s flagship law enacting Brexit. If the amendments pass, they could keep us in the customs union and very nearly in the single market - forcing us to stick to EU rules. This is the opposite of what the Prime Minister wants. These amendments aren\u0027t the end of the road - there are more votes on customs next month - but they\u0027re a huge step along the road. So we\u0027ve gone through all 15 to explain simply what they mean. Enjoy!  What were the 15 defeats to the EU Withdrawal Bill? Your Brexit votes bingo card MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 as Theresa May tries to overturn 15 defeats to her Brexit law. The amendments, passed by the House of Lords, would push Britain towards a softer Brexit if they are not blocked by the House of Commons. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. Who\u0027s voting on what, when? To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a list of the original 15 Lords defeats to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they\u0027ll achieve if they pass. For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of these will be defeated, some could pass. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through.  Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. It could force her back to the negotiating table instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment.

Dennis Meighan agreed a \u0026pound13,500 fee – \u0026pound140,000 today – to murder former male model Norman Scott, who had an affair with the late party chief in the 1960s when homosexuality was illegal. Revelations of the scandal would have torpedoed Thorpe’s glittering political career and he was said to be desperate to silence Scott. But Meighan pulled out of the contract and went to police – only for the incident allegedly to be covered up.  Meighan went on to supply a gun to the man who eventually took on the hit. Gunman Andrew Newton shot dead Scott’s dog Rinka. But the firearm jammed when he took aim at his human quarry – allowing Scott to escape. Thorpe and accomplices were eventually tried for plotting Scott’s murder, the Mail on Sunday reports. But, to widespread disbelief, they were cleared by a jury. Public fascination with the case has been reignited by the BBC drama A Very English Scandal, starring Four Weddings and Funeral actor Hugh Grant as the ex-party chief.  And now, decades after one was asked to kill the other, Meighan and Scott have held a bizarre meeting – recalling how only luck led to Scott surviving. Brought together by the Mail on Sunday for a surreal conversation, Scott asked him: “So, were you really going to murder me all those years ago?” Meighan told Scott: “That’s what they wanted, to kill you, to shut you up. “My brief was to shoot you. Would I have done it? I don’t know, really. “I was trying to work out how to get money off them without having to shoot you.” He added: “It was never personal.”  Scott quipped: “That makes me feel so much better.” Meighan was approached by an associate of former Liberal Party leader Thorpe and asked to silence his former lover Scott in the 1970s. Scott recently told the Mirror it was only one of five plots to assassinate him.  “There were five attempts to kill me,” he claimed. “One of the plans was to get me a job in America and then get me on a helicopter and drop me over the Everglades in Florida. “It seems incredible but it’s true. “Another one was to get me drunk in a pub in the West Country and drop me down tin mine in Cornwall. “Another was to attack me with a chisel hidden in a bunch of flowers. “It sounds bizarre and it sounds like the ramblings of a lunatic but it was all absolutely true. “It’s become common knowledge and now accepted as fact.”  Despite deciding not to take on the job of murdering Scott, Meighan did however end up supplying the gun used in the eventual bungled assassination attempt. He gave the Mauser firearm to would-be hitman Andrew Newton, who used it in the botched bid to kill Mr Scott. The former party leader’s lover was with his Great Dane, Rinka, on Exmoor when gunman Newton blasted the dog before turning the weapon on Mr Scott – only for it to fail. Scott, 78, said he only escaped because the weapon jammed when Newton forced it against his head.  Recalling the horrific moment he was nearly shot, Mr Scott said: “The last memory of him is of him shaking the gun in the car headlights, saying, ‘F*** it, f*** it’.” Meighan replied: “Shaking it? That wouldn’t have done much good. He should have reloaded it really. “Whether that would have done it, I don’t know.” Scott told how a more powerful bullet could have travelled through Rinka and struck him. Meighan revealed the gun came from his private collection and was the “only one that worked”.  Newton, who is still alive and living in Surrey under the name Hann Redwin, was the only protagonist ever convicted over the scandal. He was jailed for two years in the 1970s for firearms offences after confronting Scott. Newton claimed Thorpe had paid him \u0026pound5,000 to kill the politician’s his ex-lover. But an Old Bailey jury acquitted Thorpe and his accomplices of conspiracy to murder in 1979 in what was dubbed the “trial of the century”. Scott still hopes his claims will one day be proven true.

The overwhelming majority of voters want the Government to outlaw advertising aimed at children in a bid to tackle the growing obesity crisis. Campaigners on Sunday night said the findings of the exclusive ComRes/Mirror poll should convince ministers they have nothing to fear from taking on the food and drinks industry. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who has led calls for a ban through his #AdEnough campaign, said: “It’s great to see the support of the British public when it comes to the very logical idea of simply extending the current 6pm junk food advertising ban to 9pm. “We know this is where more kids are watching.  “Profits shouldn’t come before our kids\u0027 health and our kids shouldn’t be targeted relentless with unhealthy products - especially when we know its crippling effect on our NHS. “If a child watches a series of Britain’s Got Talent or X Factor, they will also watch the equivalent of an entire junk food movie. “When this generation of children is expected to live a shorter life than their own parents due to diet-related disease, it’s simply not right.” The online survey of 1,073 adults showed 76% of people agreed there should be a ban on junk food adverts targeted at children before 9pm. Support among surged Conservative voters surged to 80%, with 76% of Labour voters backing a ban. Just 16% of voters disagreed, with 7% saying they don’t know. National Obesity Forum chairman Tam Fry was “delighted” with the results.  Urging ministers to reject claims of “nanny state” interference and get on with a ban, he said: “Don’t be afraid, the public is in your side.” Mr Fry added said: “These results are showing that the public is now finally cottoning on to the fact that junk food, particularly for children, is something to be avoided and therefore getting advertisements all the time for it is annoying. “They are showing this annoyance by voting this way.” He praised ministers for pioneering the sugary drinks tax, which has slashed sugar in pop - and urged them to go further. “For the first time in at least 20 years the Government has taken on the food industry and said, ‘Enough is enough’,” he said. “I think the public is starting to understand the Government has the resolve to change things for the better.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british armys valiant sikhs who","story":"NewsBritish Army\u0027s valiant Sikhs who sacrificed their lives for UK set for memorial monument at lastJaimal Johal, the grandson and son of Sikh soldiers, remembers their hardships as Labour MP Tan Dhesi secures a London spot for monument\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor23:59, 10 JUN 2018NewsSubedar Assa Singh, second from left top row, with his regiment of the British Army in 1913 (Image: Daily Mirror)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPushing a badly-wounded captain in a wheelbarrow under heavy fire through no man’s land, the brave \u0026shylieutenant risked his life to save his superior. The British assault in the 1915 Battle of Neuve-Chapelle in France ended disastrously, like so many in the First World War, when the reinforced Germans counterattacked. One soldier called it “a foretaste of hell” with allied casualties totalling 13,000 over three days of brutal combat. Mercifully George Henderson, the injured captain, recovered and survived the war. His saviour did not. Shot in the leg during the daring rescue, amputation couldn’t save a hero who died of blood poisoning and gangrene a few weeks later despite evacuation to a Brighton hospital.  Subedar Manta Singh, of 2nd Sikh Royal Infantry, was a turbaned Sikh from the Punjab in India, one of 83,000 killed fighting in the service of Great Britain during two world wars. More than 100,000 Sikhs were wounded. Famed as fearsome warriors, some went into battle with chakram circular throwing weapons and talwar curved swords as well as rifles. An incredible 10 Victoria Crosses have been won by soldiers serving in Sikh regiments. During the First World War, 14 of the 22 \u0026shyMilitary Crosses awarded to Indian soldiers fighting with the British went to “the Lions” despite Sikhs being outnumbered by Hindu and Muslim troops in an expeditionary force sent from British-run India to Europe. From Gallipoli to the Somme, where turbaned cavalrymen lifted despairing spirits, Sikhs were brothers-in-arms with young men from places such as Sunderland, Scunthorpe, Stoke and Swansea  That proud legacy continues today – most conspicuously on Saturday when Charanpreet Singh Lall, 22, a Sikh from Leicester, became the first \u0026shyColdstream Guardsman to wear a turban in the Trooping the Colour .   Manta Singh’s proud grandson, Jaimal Johal, said \u0026shyconditions had been particularly harsh for soldiers used to much warmer weather in India. “Winter was hard and Indian soldiers didn’t have proper clothing so they suffered. Some of them were just in shorts,” says Mr Johal, 79, a retired sub-postmaster in \u0026shyMaidenhead, Berks. He moved to Britain on Boxing Day 1961. Henderson and Singh were not just comrades but friends whose bond forged in battle carried on in their families down the generations. Singh’s son, Assa, who was Mr Johal’s father, served with the British Army alongside \u0026shyHenderson’s own son Robert. In turn Mr Johal remains in touch with Robert’s son, Ian. Assa fought in North Africa during the Second World War and in Italy, including at the famous battle of Monte Cassino. The largely overlooked sacrifice and heroism of Sikh servicemen has long rankled with the 450,000-strong community in Britain but official recognition is finally near to right this wrong.  Victory is in sight for Slough’s new Labour MP, Tan Dhesi, the first turbaned Sikh in the House of Commons. He has amassed an impressive cross-party alliance demanding a national memorial in a prominent London \u0026shylocation. Elected only last year, Mr Dhesi gained Government backing after securing support from every party in Parliament. Those behind the project include veteran Tory Ken Clarke, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the Lib Dems’ Vince Cable, and John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons. His Commons motion calling for a Sikh monument is the most popular this session, collecting 266 signatures. He says: “Memorials exist in London for soldiers from the Commonwealth, British India, Poland, African-Caribbean nations and for the Gurkhas but none of a turbaned Sikh soldier.” He went on: “They fought together, died together and must be memorialised together. A statue of turbaned soldiers would be a huge statement, a historic and unique addition to the skyline of our capital – indeed the first-ever statue of turbaned Sikhs in any global capital outside of India.  “I believe it would help to promote integration and community cohesion and would show us in a very good light to all, including those millions of tourists who visit London each year.” Mr Dhesi raised \u0026pound350,000 of the estimated \u0026pound1 million cost and is pushing hard for the sculpture to be erected on a main ceremonial route – Whitehall, The Mall or Constitution Hill, between Buckingham Palace and Green Park. Home Secretary Sajid Javid gave a green light when Communities Secretary by \u0026shyestablishing a working group to explore \u0026shypotential sites. He said the Government is prepared to chip in towards the cost. “We are indebted to all those servicemen who volunteered to serve and fought to defend the freedoms we enjoy today,” says Mr Javid in an \u0026shyofficial statement. He adds: “That’s why a Sikh war memorial in our capital will honour their sacrifice.”  ITV news presenter and Good Morning Britain political editor Ranvir Singh says a \u0026shymonument is overdue. “We were not taught in school how much other nations did for the British war effort,” he says. “But now the public are aware of how brave and warrior-like the Sikh soldiers were. “I want my son to grow up seeing men with turbans remembered and respected for what they did to help him live in a free society.” A hundred years on from the end of the First World War, it’s frequently overlooked how much of the British effort was multicultural. There were more than three million soldiers and labourers from what then was the British Empire, including 1.27 million from a colonial India encompassing \u0026shyPakistan and Bangladesh. Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, says: “Sikhs, Muslims, Hindus and white British officers fought together [in] the Indian Army in both world wars, the largest volunteer armies in history. “Many people are quite surprised to hear the armies that fought a century ago look more like the Britain of 2018 than that of 1918.” Manta Singh was among a number of Indian soldiers cremated on the South Downs at Patcham. A Chattri shrine commemorates them.

Almost half of Brits have attempted a more vegan diet for health benefits but most struggle to last more than THREE months. Three quarters said they would have lasted much longer if they had more support from their friends and family. More than one in ten young people surveyed turned to a vegan diet having watched Netflix documentaries, with as many as 56 per cent of Brits between the ages of 16 and 29 saying they have been inspired by celebrity vegans like Beyonc\u0026eacute, Brad Pitt, Pink and Ellie Goulding.  Documentaries such as Cowspiracy were also cited as an inspiration, with a quarter of respondents saying social media influencers were also a big factor behind considering the switch. The poll of 2,000 adults by Kellogg’s, which has just launched a new vegan cereal range W.K. Kellogg, found that sticking to a plant based lifestyle can be short lived however with people lasting on average just three and a half months. Over 45’s had the best willpower, eating a diet free from animal ingredients for nearly five months on average. Speaking about her vegan lifestyle, Lucy Watson, author of ‘Feed me Vegan’ said: “I made the decision to move from vegetarianism to veganism three years ago. “Moving to a plant-based diet has had a really positive impact on my health, I feel so much more energised. “For me, starting my day with a good breakfast is really important, but it can be quite tricky particularly if you have a busy life and vegan friendly options are not always easily available.  “The W. K. Kellogg range really supports those trying to make vegan choices – I now have a go-to cereal for the mornings.” Of those that have attempted a more plant-based or vegan focused lifestyle, a huge 88 per cent acknowledged that it actually takes real dedication to be a full time vegan. In fact, younger people felt eating a more vegan focused diet was having an impact on their social lives with one in ten under 30s saying they had to turn down social events. Those surveyed also said it was impossible when eating out in restaurants and that the new lifestyle was too expensive to become a long-term change. Being a ‘part time’ vegan proved popular, with a third of people eating plant based one day a week.

Coming in at 6ft 2in, chaps called Oli with brown hair, grey eyes, who own a dog and earn somewhere between \u0026pound75,000 and \u0026pound100,000 are most likely to gain female admirers. However, dating app data shows women hailing from Essex called Melissa, who earn \u0026pound35,000 and \u0026pound50,000, can speak Russian and are 5ft 3in tall have the greatest chance of receiving messages from men. And those with brown eyes and blonde hair also hold most appeal among males. The dream dates were revealed by Plenty of Fish, which analysed more than one million profiles in the UK to identify the traits most likely to result in interest from users.  It also emerged women tend to seek men with a degree – whereas males opt for females who are educated to high school level. Shannon Smith, spokeswoman for Plenty of Fish, said: “There is often a difference between what singles say they want, and their actual behaviour on our app. “For example, men are often teased in the pub for being broody or wanting kids, but it’s clear that this is a big goal for them just as much as it is for women. “Or that, despite a move towards cleaner living, a first date over a pint or a cocktail seems to be the most preferable.”  It also emerged women consider a firefighter to be the most attractive job for men to have, while a career in insurance is the job males find most attractive in females. And those who have a pet tend to receive a message an average of 51 per cent faster than those who don’t. Women aged 25 are of particular interest among men, while males aged 35 are especially appealing to females. Melissa is the most popular female name, receiving the most replies on the app - with Beth, Katy and Amanda close behind. And Oli is the number one male name, followed by Jake, Robbie and Joshua. The research also shows both genders look for a date who wants to have children, as well as wanting someone who is very ambitious and owns a car.

Her horrified parents tonight told how their daughter is in intensive \u0026shytherapy after \u0026shygetting hooked on the Fortnite game. The obsessed primary school pupil... - Secretly got up in the night and played until dawn. - Neglected to go to the toilet because she could not bear to leave the screen. - Hit her father in the face when he tried to confiscate her Xbox gaming console. - Dozed off in class because of her night-time addiction. Is your child being treated for an addiction? Email webnews@mirror  Experts fear she is one of many children at risk of developing mental health problems as a \u0026shyresult of over-exposure to the fight-to-the-death scenarios. Over 40 million have \u0026shydownloaded the so-called \u0026shysurvival shooter game since it was launched last July, sparking \u0026shyrecord numbers of digital addiction. The girl’s mum tonight said: “We had no idea, when we let her play the game, of the \u0026shyaddictive nature or the impact it could have on her mental health. She is in \u0026shytherapy for the addiction after she \u0026shybecame withdrawn, \u0026shyagitated and disturbed from playing up to ten hours a day – sometimes playing until dawn, wetting \u0026shyherself so she didn’t have to leave the screen. “This is a serious issue which is destroying our little girl’s life and someone needs to step in to ban it before it becomes an epidemic.” Fortnite has been endorsed by a multitude of top sport and music stars. The game’s most popular format is the Battle Royale in which 100 players fight each other until one is left standing. Although the game is free to download, its developers make money from hooked users who pay for in-game purchases to boost their performances.  Mum Carol, 36, said they bought their daughter an Xbox in January and shortly after she downloaded Fortnite. She and her husband Richard, who we are not picturing to protect the identity of their daughter, say it was not until mid-March they noticed \u0026shyworrying signs. Carol said: “We got called in by her head \u0026shyteacher asking if \u0026shyeverything was OK. She had fallen asleep twice in lessons and her grades were slipping. “When we asked our daughter what the \u0026shyproblem was, she became unusually \u0026shyargumentative and aggressive, which we just put down to her hormones.” But soon the sports-mad girl started saying she too tired to go to gym or ballet classes, as well as missing the family visits to church on Sunday mornings. Noticing small but regular payments on their credit card to Microsoft, adding up to over \u0026pound50 a month, they asked if she knew anything about this. The mum said: “Our daughter told us it could be some extras she’d paid for on Fortnite. “Of course we were furious and confiscated her Xbox. But then she lashed out and hit my husband in the face.” Despite limiting their daughter’s time on the game to one hour on school nights and two on weekends, they were still suspicious. Carol said: “My husband saw her light on in the night and found her sitting on a urine-soaked \u0026shycushion playing the game. “I found her backside was red-raw. She was so hooked to the game she wouldn’t even go to the toilet.” The next morning they sat her down and asked her to tell the truth.  The mum said: “Crying, she told us that every night for the past two months she had waited until we were asleep and then got up to play, sometimes until 5am. “We worked out that she could have been playing for up to ten hours a day, and we’d had no idea.” The parents contacted addictions counsellor Steve Pope, who agreed to see the girl for psychotherapy. Steve told the Sunday People: “Over the last two months I’ve been \u0026shycontacted by dozens of parents with children as young as eight showing signs of addiction to Fortnite. “I’ve been working in this field for three decades and never seen anything like it, how widespread and potentially damaging this is. “I know bright kids who will fail their exams this summer because of Fortnite, kids who are stealing from their parents and friends to pay for the extras, kids who urinate in bottles because they can’t bear to leave the game.” Experts claim it is the high-profile celebrity \u0026shyendorsements in recent weeks that have fuelled exposure. Steve added: “You see Premier League footballers celebrating goals with Fortnite dances and it’s the biggest possible advert for kids. “It’s the perfect gateway into \u0026shyaddiction and gambling.”  Professional gamers are making up to \u0026pound500,000 a month from live-streaming their Fortnite games for addicted children to watch. The nine-year-old girl in our \u0026shyreport is slowly \u0026shygetting back on track with her sports and schooling. But her mum said: “I urge every parent out there to know what this game can do, how it sucks young children in and could ruin lives.” Culture Secretary Matt Hancock has warned that addictive online shooter games such as Fortnite have a damaging impact on children. 6 TIPS TO KEEP ’EM SAFE Gaming expert Andy Robertson of the online safety group Internet Matters offers six tips for parents on Fortnite: 1 Make sure it is age appropriate The Video Standards council rate Fortnite as PEGI 12 for mild violence. 2 Monitor who your child is talking to Check the communication settings on the game to ensure children aren’t talking to strangers. 3. Manage in-app purchases on the game You will need to set up passwords on credit cards associated with the system. 4. Set time limits on Fortnite Something you can agree with your child once you understand how the game works. 5. Join in Families will get the most out of the game when parents join in and turn it from something in bedrooms to a game for the family room. 6. Stay in tune Parents should keep abreast of updates in the game to be aware of possible costs. For more info go to internetmatters.org. Prem stars boost craze Fortnite has gripped the footballing world – with players from Atletico Madrid to Cardiff City endorsing it. The list of top-flight players performing Fortnite dances as goal celebrations extends from Atletico’s Antoine Griezmann to England stars Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Kieran Trippier. Members of the England squad have openly bragged about their skills playing Fortnite. Alli, 22, boasted he is top of the Three Lions’ ranking. The Spurs midfielder, who did the game’s “floss dance” to celebrate an FA Cup semi-final goal last month, said: “I think that it’s a great way to relax and rest your body playing \u0026shyPlayStation. “I’d say I am the best \u0026shyFortnite player. I’ve won over 100 games. But a lot of the boys have just started playing it.  “We play in teams so it \u0026shydefinitely brings us together.” Cardiff defender Callum Paterson has made Fortnite celebrations his speciality. And France international Griezmann regularly performs the “Take The L”dance after a goal. In the Fortnite game the dances are performed to celebrate a killing an opponent. Other celebrity fans of the game include Argentinian aces Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero. The obsession with Fortnite even extends to watching others play.  Last month an online video of Canadian rapper Drake playing Fortnite with pro-player Ninja was watched more than 600,000 times. Ninja – real name Tyler Blevins – reportedly makes nearly \u0026pound400,000 a month from live-streaming himself playing the game on Twitch, a live version of YouTube. Fortnite’s makers, Epic Games, have even announced a Fortnite Celebrity Pro-Am which will pair 50 celebrities and 50 pro players. Fear behind fun Internet Matters ambassador and psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos says: “Games can become quite addictive for children because they’re fun in the way that cartoons are fun. “A lot of apps or games act on the brain in the same way that an itch that needs to be scratched.

But historians believe the closest we have actually come to nuclear Armageddon was on October 27 1962 - aka \u0027Black Saturday\u0027. And not many people realise that the end of the world could have started on British soil - and how close we actually came to playing our part in the annihilation of mankind. The US nearly destroyed the Soviet Union at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis with weapons based near the peaceful Lincolnshire town of Caistor. The American missiles were installed in the UK at the height of the Cold War in a deal intended to strengthen Nato’s nuclear deterrent.  How the missiles got there  It was 1958 and the allies were suffering a crisis of confidence, the Grimsby  reports.  The Russians had taken a firm lead in the space race by launching the first satellite, Sputnik, and military leaders warned that a “technology gap” might extend to nuclear weapons. If the Soviets had effective intercontinental ballistic missiles, they might be able to launch a massive first strike. Britain had its own nuclear arsenal but, in the event of a war, would rely on jet planes - the V Force - to carry freefall bombs to the enemy.  One answer was to move America’s existing intermediate-range missiles to bases within striking distance of Moscow, including in Turkey and the UK. So in September 1958, under the codename ‘Project Emily’, the first Thor IRBMs arrived at RAF bases, along with their 1.4-megaton warheads.  Black Saturday  The NATO alert level had already been raised to DEFCON 2 - just one below full-blown war - when events of that day unfolded.  Thor missiles were erected on their pads at their Lincolnshire bases, and experts believe they may have been brought to full readiness.  It means they could have been fired towards the Soviet Union within just eight minutes, had the order come by telephone. Meanwhile, Vulcan bomber taxied on to runways, fuelled, armed and ready to take off within 15 minutes. Thankfully - not least in part to a Russian submarine officer who refused to fire on the US Navy at the blockade around Cuba - after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy\u0027s cabinet, the two powers agreed to scale back their missiles, and nuclear war was averted.  Top secret deployment A total of 20 launch sites were chosen in eastern England, grouped around four hubs in Lincolnshire, East Anglia, Rutland and East Yorkshire.  The Lincolnshire command and control station was set up at RAF Hemswell, an old Bomber Command base 15 miles south of Scunthorpe .  Satellite sites were chosen at RAF Caistor, Ludford Magna and two villages near Lincoln: Bardney and Coleby Grange. When installed on their launch pads, the 65ft-high Thor missiles looked like miniature moon rockets but their purpose was much more sinister. When brought to readiness, they could be fired within 15 minutes and would climb at supersonic speed to an altitude of 280 miles, on the way to hitting a target up to 1,500 miles away. If detonated in the sky above a target such as Grimsby, the 1.44-megaton warhead was powerful enough to kill everyone and destroy everything within five miles of the town centre, cause third degree burns up to nine miles from the blast zone and smash windows more than 13 miles away.               How Lincolnshire was nearly destroyed  At Ludford Magna, a now-forgotten RAF base between Louth and Market Rasen, the unthinkable almost happened when a missile came close to blowing up.  Firefighters described how an accident with leaking rocket fuel left the launch pad shrouded in a cloud of evaporating liquid oxygen, according to the Grimbsy .  Had the worst happened, a ground-level nuclear detonation would have wiped out everything for a radius of three miles and caused third-degree burns to victims in the nearby towns. And it would have devastated Grimsby and wider Lincolnshire, contaminating between 100 and 300 miles of the country with radiation. The accident, which happened in 1960, was only revealed to the BBC by the base commander in 1999. It reportedly horrified US Air Force personnel, who had joint-control of the missiles with their RAF colleagues, and remained a little-known secret for decades.   Transporting the weapons  Nuclear warheads were distributed from the top-secret storage site at Faldingworth near Market Rasen.  Incredibly, according to the leading military history website bcar.org.uk , the weapons were transported at night in trucks, accompanied by only a military policeman and his trusty guard dog, in order to avoid raising suspicion.   Fighter planes took to the skies from RAF Binbrook, south of Grimsby, and at North Cotes, Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles were prepared to seek out and destroy any Russian bombers that might approach the coast.  Volunteer members of the Royal Observer Corps were trained to report detailed information about a nuclear explosion, should they survive one - for despite its rural character, Lincolnshire’s military bases would have made prime targets for a Soviet first strike. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 in 2008, former Wing Commander Peter West, who at the time was part of the V Force and based at Coningsby, confirmed that Lincolnshire’s nuclear forces had been brought to full readiness. The aircraft were all ready to go,” he said. “We were fully kitted out with our flying gear. All we had to do was get in, put our straps on, press the button and the engines would start up.”  He pleaded with his wife to drive their three children to Scotland and hide but she refused to leave him, believing, probably correctly, that a nuclear war would spare no one in the long run. She decided to remain at home with their kids so they would die together. That same day, thousands of miles away off the coast of Cuba, an American destroyer depth-charged a Russian submarine armed with nuclear tipped torpedoes. Fortunately, the crew of the Soviet vessel decided not to act on a standing order to fire their missiles if attacked. The end of the missiles Politicians on both sides stepped back from the brink of war and the Cuban Missile Crisis marked the beginning of the end for the Thors. At the height of the drama, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had been prepared to offer a secret deal to the Soviets by which the missiles would be immobilised.

In what is likely to be hailed as great news by vegetarian and vegan eaters alike, KFC is planning on introducing its own ‘meat-free’ versions of its famous dishes so that it can accommodate all of its customers. KFC says it intends to create its own version of meatless fried chicken, with promises of great taste - as it will still be coated in the fast food\u0027s signature blend of 11 herbs and spices.  The vegetarian chicken will offer the great taste of KFC to new and existing customers who are changing their dining habits, the chain said. It comes alongside plans to reduce the number of calories in its meals by 20% over the next seven years. KFC also plans to develop a new menu featuring meals with less than 600 calories over the same time frame.

Super-fit Stephen Bullough, 51, had eye pain, leg tremors and breathing problems after the insect latched on to his arm on a country walk. Now he has lost sight in both eyes, two years after noticing a red mark on his arm. The former world kickboxing champion – an 8th Dan in kickboxing and karate – said: “Everything has been taken from me. I wake up not knowing if it’s light or dark.”   Dad-of-two Stephen, an ex-personal trainer, was only diagnosed as having Lyme disease – which comes from tick bites – after private tests last August.  He claims NHS specialists gave him different diagnoses, from asthma to functional neurological disorder. And said he has been refused treatment because NHS blood tests have not revealed the antibodies in his system.  The karate coach never smoked or drank alcohol, and trained every day before he was bitten on a walk. At first, he thought the red mark on his arm was ringworm and put cream on it – but it was the start of two-year nightmare. Stephen, from Wigan, Gtr Manchester, said “I have frustration not in the NHS, but in individual doctors or so-called specialists.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle pretty pink arrives","story":"NewsMeghan Markle is pretty in pink with new curly hairstyle at Trooping the ColourPrince Harry and Meghan are expected to join members of the monarchy on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Clarke-Billings10:24, 9 JUN 2018Updated17:54, 9 JUN 2018NewsMeghan smiled and waved to crowds in the sunshine (Image: UK Press)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle looked pretty in pink as she arrived for this year\u0027s Trooping the Colour to celebrate the Queen\u0027s official birthday. The new Duchess of Sussex, 36, wore her dark hair in loose ringlets as she joined Prince Harry at the traditional summer spectacle. Meghan experienced the pomp and pageantry of the event for the first time when she arrived on Horse Guards Parade with Harry in a carriage, along with the Queen\u0027s cousin the Duke of Kent. The couple were greeted by the sight of hundreds of Guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins lined up on the parade ground - Henry VIII\u0027s former jousting yard - as the event began. Harry, 33, did not travel on horseback alongside his brother William because he is not a Regimental Colonel. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who married three weeks today, travelled from Buckingham Palace along The Mall to cheers from royal fans gathered in the famous London thoroughfare. The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge were in another carriage while a third carried Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, the Countess of Wessex and her daughter Lady Louise.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a dress by Carolina Herrera and a hat by Philip Treacy, while Kate wore a dress by Alexander McQueen and a hat by Juliette Botterill. Camilla wore a pale blue silk dress and coat by Bruce Oldfield and a hat by Philip Treacy. Trooping the Colour is a ceremonial spectacle that brings together prestigious regiments and the families of the serving men and women in celebration of the monarch\u0027s official birthday. Stands lining Horse Guards were filled with the wives, girlfriends and parents of the servicemen who when not performing ceremonial duties are fighting soldiers.  Meghan, Harry and the other members of the royal family took their place in Wellington\u0027s former office which overlooks the parade ground. Later this afternoon, the couple will join other members of the royal family on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds. The Queen, who recently had a successful eye operation to remove a cataract, will watch the Trooping ceremony from a dais in Horse Guards and later inspect the lines of guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins.  More than 1,000 soldiers are taking part in the annual event with traditional display of pomp and pageantry. The colour being paraded this year is the flag of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. The Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrates his 97th birthday on Sunday, has retired from official public duties and is not in attendance. The royal colonels, all on horseback, will accompany the Queen. They include the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, the Princess Royal, Colonel of the Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Cambridge, Colonel of the Irish Guards. Riding in the ceremony for the first time is the Duke of York in his new role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.  As with previous years, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall sat together in a carriage. The procession is accompanied by a Sovereign\u0027s Escort of the Household Cavalry, made up of Life Guards and Blues and Royals, in their silver and gold breastplates and plumed helmets. After the ceremony the royal family will head back to Buckingham Palace and gather on the balcony to watch the RAF flypast. Among the 23 aircraft taking part are modern jets and historic aircraft, while the Red Arrows will be the finale.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will visit Australia, Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand in autumn. The couple\u0027s visit will coincide with the 2018 Invictus Games, which will take place in Sydney. A statement from Kensington Palace confirmed: Their Royal Highnesses have been invited to visit the Realms of Australia and New Zealand by the countries\u0027 respective governments. The Duke and Duchess will visit the Commonwealth countries of Fiji and Tonga at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  The official royal tour will be a rite of passage for royal newcomer Meghan as she settles into married life with Harry. All eyes will be on her as she gets to grips with becoming one half of a royal tour double act, with daily engagements, tree planting and ubiquitous unveiling ceremonies all possibilities on the itinerary. Harry and Meghan will be following in the footsteps of his parents, the Prince of Wales and Diana, whose first royal tour as a married couple was also to Australia and New Zealand. During that trip, Charles and Diana travelled 23,601 miles and spent 41 days overseas. In April 2014, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge went to Australia and New Zealand, and the pair were away for 18 days, covering 23,701 miles.    The newlyweds\u0027 first major overseas tour together in October has raised fears for their plans to start a family as soon as possible. It is specifically plans for the legs of the trip which take in Fiji and Tonga that are causing concern - as there has been a shock Zika virus and dengue fever outbreak on the islands . Zika is especially of concern as it can cause complications for unborn babies - and now there are fears the tour could affect their plans to have a child. Pregnant women are advised to avoid areas where mosquito-borne Zika is present, as the disease can cause microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with abnormally small heads.   Fears of new deadly global epidemic after at least 13 die from rare brain virus in India  A source said: “The Duke and Duchess will have taken advice at the highest level before deciding that they were happy to go ahead and plan the trip.” The Foreign Office advises: “Couples should follow guidance on prevention of sexual transmission of Zika and avoid conception while travelling and for up to six months on return.”   Swarm of highly aggressive mosquitoes could hit Britain this summer after unusually warm weather  This makes it unlikely that Meghan, who turns 37 on August 4, and Harry, 33, would try to conceive until May 2019.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are due to visit Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific islands on their first major overseas tour together in October. However, it\u0027s specifically Harry and Meghan’s plans for the legs of the trip which take in Fiji and Tonga that are causing concern - as there has been a shock Zika virus and dengue fever outbreak on the islands. Zika is especially of concern as it can cause complications for unborn babies - and now there are fears the tour could affect their plans to have a child. Pregnant women are advised to avoid areas where mosquito-borne Zika is present, as the disease can cause microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with abnormally small heads.  A source said: “The Duke and Duchess will have taken advice at the highest level before deciding that they were happy to go ahead and plan the trip.” The Foreign Office advises: “Couples should follow guidance on prevention of sexual transmission of Zika and avoid conception while travelling and for up to six months on return.”  This makes it unlikely that Meghan, who turns 37 on August 4, and Harry, 33, would try to conceive until May 2019. Sources have suggested Meghan may skip the trip should she fall pregnant before October.

His club empire had been brought to its knees by a rival strip joint, which poached more than half his topless dancers, then paid them to strip fully naked to ensure his punters followed. Suddenly Stringfellow found himself sitting on his golden throne in an empty club, his girls in G-strings standing around sipping drinks because there were no businessmen to titillate. Meanwhile, not far away, eager crowds queued along London’s Tottenham Court Road outside the new Spearmint Rhino lap dancing club to see everything the girls had to offer.  Desperate to avoid bankruptcy for the second time in a decade, Stringfellow convened his “war council” and they settled on an eye-popping plan.  They chose one of their longest-serving dancers as an undercover – and completely uncovered – spy, who would pose as a stripper at Spearmint  Rhino’s lap dancing club in Camden, North-West London.  Her mission was to find out why girls at the new strip joint were earning so much and feed that information back to her bosses. The plan was bold, it was brilliant… and it failed miserably.  Stringfellow’s right-hand man and artistic director Mark Young recalled: “We waved her off one night and we waited for her to come back and report. “She never came back. The money was that good up there.” By the time Stringfellow found himself embroiled in a turf war with US giant Spearmint Rhino in 2000, he had already clawed his way back from financial ruin. His attempts to crack the US – opening clubs in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles – ended in disaster. The nightclub in New York was attacked by the mafia after Stringfellow refused to pay a dry cleaning bill at a firm they owned. His publicist Matt Glass said: “It was classic Peter. He got his suit back and he said, ‘I’m not paying for that, there’s a stain on it. I’m not using them again, cancel them’.  “He woke up next morning and there were bullet holes across the front of his club. “Apparently they’re still in the wall today.” Meanwhile the Los Angeles club had closed within a year. It turned out that stars such as Charlie Sheen, known for ordering expensive bottles of wine in London or New York, stayed sober when out in Hollywood. “They’d occasionally go mad and get an orange juice,” Stringfellow moaned. Saddled with huge debts, he was declared bankrupt in 1992. But before coming home, he visited a strip club in Miami – inspiring him to introduce topless table dancing at his club in Covent Garden. He quickly cornered the market in erotic entertainment. And there was plenty of money to be had as well. One US punter tipped a dancer \u0026pound23,000, also leaving \u0026pound2,000 for the waitress. But Stringfellow’s monopoly ended when Rhino boss John Gray decided it was time to conquer Britain, bragging he would launch 100 strip clubs and float them on the stock exchange. Unlike Stringfellow’s, these clubs would offer full nudity.  But first, Gray needed to topple the King of Clubs. He started the spy war by sending two girls to work for Stringfellow and report back with inside info on prices. At first, Stringfellow laughed it off, announcing he would have happily told his rival his prices if he had called. But Gray’s next move wiped the smile off his face. Offering Stringfellows’ “Angels” massive pay rises to strip completely, he had poached more than half his rival’s dancers by the time his first club opened. Within two years Gray claimed he was making \u0026pound300,000 a week. His top dancers took home \u0026pound200,000 a year. Stringfellow, known for his love of leopard print and tiny thongs, admitted: “We were shell shocked. We’d had it all our own way for years.” After his attempt to infiltrate Spearmint Rhino failed, Stringfellow and his cronies hit on another plan. They hired private detectives Sid Creasey and George Rickman to dig up dirt on the mysterious Gray.  Dirt was not hard to find. In 1995 he was given six months in jail for writing bad cheques for work done at a Spearmint Rhino club. And he had earlier ended up behind bars after making a false statement to win US Navy contracts. UK authorities had no idea of Gray’s past, but he smiled away the scandal. Spearmint Rhino emerged unscathed, helped by now-disgraced PR Max Clifford. Desperate for ideas, the private detectives scoured licensing rules. They found that while naked girls were allowed, punters could only look, not touch. On stage everything was by the book, but it seemed in the private booths neither dancers nor customers played by the rules. The detectives took an infra-red camera to capture evidence. They were nearly exposed when a dancer saw the red light, but escaped by insisting it was a mobile phone. The pair returned with video said to show dancers pressing their breasts into men’s faces, rubbing against them, and even performing a sex act on a fake Nigerian prince.  An investigation by the Met’s vice unit concluded that Gray’s club was one of “the biggest brothels in London” – and there were even reports of orgies in the private booths. Two undercover officers told magistrates they were offered sex in a private room at \u0026pound500 for 30 minutes. Spearmint Rhino denied the claims, sacking two dancers who suggested they would have sex for money. But this time Gray found it more difficult to shrug off the dirt. There were protests outside his clubs nationwide. Camden council revoked the strip joint’s entertainment licence, but it was overturned on appeal. Once again, Stringfellow’s attempts to outfox his rival had failed. Worse, he had actually given his rival priceless publicity. With lad culture at its peak, the allegations sent more men flocking to Spearmint Rhino clubs across the country. Gray has since bought two private planes, mansions in both the US and the UK, and a 55ft yacht with the profits of his empire. He also dated X Factor reject Chloe Mafia after meeting her at the Playboy Mansion in 2015.

The royal cousins were seen adorably playing together at a polo match this afternoon, giggling as they relaxed on the grass at Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucstershire. The duo seem inseparable, never straying too far from each other.  But at one point, it all got too much for little George who had a tearful moment and needed to be consoled by his mum, Kate. He seemed to have a sad look on his face as his doting mum took him into a loving embrace, tenderly stroking his cheek with a concerned look on her face.    It comes just one day after the Trooping the Colour celebrations, where sassy Savannah, seven, hilariously put her hand over George\u0027s mouth to shush him during the National Anthem. They were undoubtedly delighted to be reunited at today\u0027s match and were joined by George\u0027s mum, Kate, sister, Princess Charlotte, and Savannah\u0027s mum, Autumn Phillips, and sister, Isla. Savannah is one of the Queen\u0027s great grandchildren, and her dad Peter Phillips is Princess Anne\u0027s son.  It was held as part of a series of charitable polo matches that Prince Harry and Prince William will play in this summer, to raise money for the Royal Marsden and Centrepoint. The little prince, who is shy and reserved, held a mini mallet as he played in the grass, mimicking his dad, William, who was taking part.

At one point, she executes a polished forward-roll, while mum Kate, who wore a \u0026pound39.99 Zara dress and Russell \u0026amp Bromley wedges, looked on laughing.    Continuing the cheeky display, she donned a pair or sunglasses and appeared to strike a pose at another point. She wasn\u0027t the only royal in good spirits.  Her brother George, who\u0027s often shy in public, seemed to get into the swing of things, and was seen playing around with a polo mallet - though he was also spotted being comforted by his mum. The pair seemed to be delighted to be reunited with cousins Savannah and Isla, who are the daughters of Peter Phillips, Princess Anne\u0027s only son.  They were present with mum Autumn Phillips.

The neighbours, including six children, perished in one apartment on the 22nd floor of the tower - flat number 193 - the highest number of deaths in any flat in the whole building. The two women who escaped, Naomi Li, 33, and her cousin Lydia Liao, 24, had no idea at the time they were minutes away from dying as they sheltered with the two families in the flat on third from top floor of the 24-storey. But they alone made the crucial decision to leave which saved their lives. The cousins made their descent down the smoke-filled narrow stairwell, passing bodies on the way - their only protection from toxic fumes being a wet towel and a cardigan. Had they not done so, they would have died.  Naomi and Lydia managed to leave the flat minutes before it was overcome with flames, according to a confidential police report seen by The Sunday Times .   The dossier revealed how Naomi and Lydia left just minutes before the flames reached the flat and made it down to safety almost two and a half hours after the inferno started. Before fleeing the flat, Naomi rang her husband, Lee Chapman, who was abroad on business, and told him: “We are going down, but I don’t know if we will make it or not. I love you.” They were exhausted by the time they reached firefighters on the 5th or 6th floor but they made it out alive, with CCTV showing the pair finally exiting the building at 3.22am.  Barbara Lane, a fire expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry, said the fire service\u0027s controversial stay put advice occurred during a window of opportunity when the total evacuation of Grenfell needed to occur.  She also revealed that 24 residents died on the top floor - the most on any level - and that two further people jumped to their deaths.

The Met Office has backed a scorching three-month summer forecast which will delight Brits ahead of World Cup BBQ parties and Wimbledon in July. This week, sub-tropical air from the Azores will see a week of 23C sunshine for the south of England, with showers after midweek in the north-west. And highs of 33C from late June were forecast by The Weather Company. This summer will be the hottest since 2006 as long as June to August has an average UK temperature at least 0.87C above the 14.3C summer average, Met Office records show.  Government forecasts show there is double the usual probability of this summer having a higher temperature than 2013\u0027s 15.17C, which would make 2018 the hottest summer for a century. Bookmakers Ladbrokes cut odds on this summer being the hottest on record to the shortest ever offered – just 5/2. Spokesman Alex Apati said: “Punters and weathermen believe Britain will wilt. “Odds on a record summer are shorter than ever.”  Britain is set to wilt due to high pressure, which brings hot and dry conditions, the Met Office said. The national weather service is warning emergency services, transport leaders, business chiefs and councils of the risks of a hotter than normal three months.  Last year saw a grim school holidays season, while summer 2014 was ruined by rain following ex-Hurricane Bertha and 2012 had the wettest summer for 100 years.  But 2009 was a scorcher and 2006 saw a peak of 36.5C on July 19, in Wisley, Surrey.    A Met Office spokesman said: “For June-August, above-average temperatures are more likely than below-average temperatures. “The probability the UK average temperature for June-August will fall into the warmest of our five categories is 40 per cent. The coldest of our five categories is around 5 per cent. “The likelihood of above-average temperatures is greater than usual. “The Met Office long-range prediction system shows a slightly increased chance of high-pressure patterns across the UK.”    The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The warmest summer since 2006 is a possibility, after recent years saw a series of disappointing summers. “The June to August period only needs to be 1C above average for it to happen.” Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Channel, owned by The Weather Company, said: “33C is expected by early July as heat from high pressure over Britain builds.” "},{"url":null,"title":"youre going caravan camping holiday","story":"AdvertorialIf you\u0027re going on a caravan or camping holiday this summer you need to read thisFollow these tips to transform your experience\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDave Masters12:43, 10 JUN 2018AdvertorialGet set for an amazing adventure\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCaravan and camping holidays can be fantastic - but you need to plan ahead to make the most of your time away.

Extend your space  No matter how spacious your caravan there\u0027s always going to be the need for a bit more space. With the glorious summer weather there\u0027s no reason not to move outside and create an additional living area, a lounge outdoors if you like.  The Urban Escape Event Shelter , above, has two sides and offers 50+ UPF, which means it filters out up to 98 per cent of UV rays. The water resistance is also capable of seeing off moderate rain too.   Rain or shine a gazebo is a great way to keep you comfortable. They offer shelter if it rains and sun protection if it\u0027s gloriously hot.    While you\u0027re out in the sun enjoying lunch you\u0027ll probably want something to sit on too, so take a look at the Urban Escape Folding Chairs , above, in either black or blue, for \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound20) or treat yourself to the ultimate in luxury with the Urban Escape King Size Moonchair , now just \u0026pound30 (save \u0026pound30).

Pair this with the outdoor chairs we suggested earlier and you\u0027re ready for an outdoor meal with all the comforts of home. If sitting on the floor is more your thing, grab a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (save \u0026pound10) to keep you dry on damp ground.  It\u0027s also important to be able to keep meat, fish and drinks nice and cool when you\u0027re enjoying the outdoor cooking.

There were huge cheers as the newlyweds joined other royals in front of an excited crowd for Trooping the Colour today, but in a whisper to her husband the former actress admitted to suffering from nerves, MirrorOnline can reveal. To the general public at large, the Duchess of Sussex looked comfortable and at ease alongside Harry as she waited to curtsy to the Queen in front of the huge crowd gathered on the Mall. However it now appears she needed some reassurance from those stood around her.  Meghan was making her debut on the palace balcony to mark the Queen’s birthday celebrations just three weeks after the royal wedding in Windsor. She stood next to Harry but slightly behind future Queen Kate Middleton who chatted to Camilla as they waited for Her Majesty to arrive. According to a lipreader, at one point Harry wipes his mouth as he turns to talk to Meghan and asks her simply: Okay? His wife replies: Yeah, are you? Harry replies simply: Yeah. After asking each other if they were “okay”, Meghan also admitted to Harry that she was “nervous!” Harry replies Yes and then smiles before saying okay?    In further snippets of conversation spotted as they turned towards the camera, Harry appears to say: “Errr. When you get into it I\u0027ll tell you more later.” Seconds later, he adds: “Then there\u0027s the flypast and then we all look up to the sky.” Meghan further responds with “alright” a couple of times while continuing to smile at the thousands of people on the grounds outside Buckingham Palace. After the Queen arrived and took her place front and centre, Meghan could be seen smiling brightly over her shoulder throughout the rest of the gathering. It has been a whirlwind few weeks for the young royals, with Meghan walking down the aisle to wed Harry after a series of public family fallouts, including concerns over her father’s health. However, the former Suits star has managed to keep her nerves away from view at a series of public events - and with many more to come, she is likely to get used to the bigger displays.

The Folio Society has released The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana featuring illustrations from Los Angeles-based illustrator Victo Ngai. And Ngai has reportedly claimed the new edition brings a female perspective to the book after the original manuscript dating back to around 200 AD was mostly aimed at a male audience. The book has long been considered to be the bible of sex, providing advice on positions and techniques.   The new book\u0027s promo blurb reads: There have been many editions of the Kama Sutra , but none more vividly imagined as through the work of award-winning artist Victo Ngai.  Each full-colour illustration weaves an intricate story and tantalises with erotic suggestion. Ngai has also created 25 beautiful black and white interpretations of the sexual positions and these liberally illustrate the text.  A signed artist’s print portraying an amorous couple locked in the Embrace of Thighs is presented with every book.  In an interview promoting the book, Ngai told MailOnline she wanted the book to be erotic but elegant - and more than sex.  Instead of creating illustrations which are overtly sexual, I tried to walk the fine line of creating something that\u0027s tantalizing, yet thoughtful and elegant at the same time. And she realises now that she had a different take than previous versions.

Roseangle House as one of eight girls and four boys in the Milne family.At the age of 23, Ethel married husband John at the registrar’s office which was located at the bottom of King Street.The couple had three children together Brian, Jack and Muriel.In 1963 the couple, together with son Brian, moved to Toronto, Canada, where daughter Muriel lived, and they were joined by son Jack two years later.Tragically the family were only there for four years before Ethel’s husband died at the age of 55.Ethel stayed in Canada with her daughter until 2013 when Muriel died following a lengthy illness.Although Ethel often visited Dundee she only moved back permanently to Broughty Ferry in February, where she now lives with son Brian.Although Ethel’s hearing is starting to deteriorate at the grand age of 106, she has had no major operations and her memory is second to none as she often reflects on her time playing field hockey as a goalie or her time spent travelling the world competing in Scottish Dancing competitions.She learned to drive while in Canada and only stopped when she was 92.Ethel said: “I have been very lucky to live this long and it is great to still keep in touch with my sister Ruby who will be 99 this year.“I have a great memory and could tell you stories and memories for days.”Her sons Brian and Jack said: “With a thousand stories and memories all the family wish this remarkable woman a very happy birthday and we hope she enjoyed her special day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man exceeded 40mph speed limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man has had his driving

free to local children later in the year.Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus will be released online in a downloadable format, while thousands of hard copies will also be printed.Edited and introduced by Dr Daniel Cook, of Dundee University’s English department, the book will comprise the complete 1818 text of the ground-breaking science fiction novel, as well as dozens of commissioned images produced by award-winning local comics artists.“Frankenstein is one of the most influential novels ever written,” said Dr Cook. “It is studied in schools and universities across the English-speaking world, and everyone is in some way familiar with the story of the god-like scientist and his monstrous creation.”Shelley spent two years living on South Baffin Street as a teenager, from 1812-14, after her father, William Godwin, sent her to live with the wealthy jute-producing Baxter family.This spell would influence her, as she acknowledged: “It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered.”The project is funded by

people from a childhood in the opera to running a music studio tristans life in music","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe genre may have changed but the music Tristan Button grew up surrounded by still has an effect on him.The 37-year-old, who realised his dream of running a studio nine years ago when he launched Dundee Music Studios, said his father was president of the Tayside Opera for many years.\u0026#8220There was constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music department, but eventually the must have got a bit of extra cash and got a trombone so I started playing the trombone,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And I did that right thought to near the end of high school.\u0026#8221While he trained and began working as an engineer, he started DJing electronic and hip-hop music, later moving into scratch DJing.\u0026#8220Some of my friends had a band and my best friend had just been asked to be the drummer so he asked if I wanted to come along and do some scratching on top of the music,\u0026#8221 he said.After a few weeks, Tristan asked if they were ok with him bringing along his synthesizers and the band kicked off from there.\u0026#8220It was great, we had a great time doing that and the band was together for about 12 years.\u0026#8221Spending most of his spare time being involved in music and going into so many studios, Tristan said he always had it in the back of his mind that he one day wanted to run his one of his own.He took a few business classes and looked into what it would involve, but the timing didn\u0026#8217t feel quite right.Then in 2007, both his parents passed away within two months of each other.\u0026#8220It kind of just turned my life on it\u0026#8217s head,\u0026#8221 he said.He quit his job and spent six months travelling around Australia with his future wife, before coming back to DundeeThen in 2009 he was told that a charity studio run by his friend\u0026#8217s dad near the Marketgait was up for sale, and Tristan decided to take the chance.\u0026#8220It was quite a big thing for me, a bit of a massive thing for me actually but at that point in my life it was a risk I was willing to take,\u0026#8221 he said.He launched the studio, a band booked one of his rooms full time and the business began to slowly grow, but it wasn\u0026#8217t until about a year and a half after opening that it began to turn profitable.\u0026#8220I remember six months into it being really really worried about things, that I might not be able to keep running,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220But I persevered with it and it\u0026#8217s worked out.\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m never going to be a millionaire from running the studio but it\u0026#8217s more of a lifestyle job. I get to spend an awful lot of time with my kids which I\u0026#8217m quite grateful for.\u0026#8221There is still a lot of hard work which goes into the studio, with Tristan and Harris, one of the studio\u0026#8217s staff, staying up until 5am one recent weekend to prepare it for the launch of the Dundee Music Academy, but it\u0026#8217s paying off.The Academy is Tristan\u0026#8217s next big project and he wants to encourage more people to start playing music.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217ve got big plans for the music academy and high hopes for it,\u0026#8221 he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fe9ac928b.jpg ","title":"dundee people pictures dundee youngsters take steps to show off their urban moves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of little groovers had the chance to show their moves in the city’s biggest dance festival.The festival, which took place at the Gardyne Theatre, saw approximately 600 children showing off what they have learned in their Urban Moves dance classes run by Leisure and Culture Dundee.Running over three days, the dance festival invited different Urban Moves classes to show off their skills to friends, family and other dance enthusiasts, ensuring all of the varying age groups got the opportunity to experience dancing on the big stage.“We have also now extended to evening classes for some of the more senior pupils from S1 upwards.“At the event all the kids were great – with so many children it could have been crazy but they were all fantastic and so keen to get up on the stage.“We work with them all year round to build up their confidence so there was no stage fright.

In the Maryfield ward, people looking to get in their 10,000 steps for the day can tackle the city centre to Dudhope Park walk. While on the move, walkers can view Dudhope Castle, which served as a barracks during the First and Second World Wars.Anyone wanting to build up their stamina for this year’s Kiltwalk could tackle the West End Wander.The 3.4-mile route is likely to take just over an hour while passing the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Magdalen Green.Residents within the Coldside ward have an array of walks right on their doorstep, including the 35-minute Law Crescent walk. The walk starts at the supposed site of King Alpin’s battle between the Picts and Scots.Starting off at Kings Cross Hospital, the route goes around the foot of the law before passing near to St John’s High School.Historic castles feature on the East End Douglas Circuit.The one hour and 20 minute trek starts outside Douglas Library on Balmoral Avenue while taking in Claypotts Castle.And what could be better than a walk on the beach? The Sandy Beach walk starts at Broughty Castle and takes in more than three miles of picturesque scenery.To let off some steam, head for the Old Railway Stroll in Lochee. The 20-minute jaunt follows a path that used to form part of the Dundee to Newtyle railway line. Starting outside Lochee Library the first point of interest is the red stone public baths and library which were paid for the by the mill-owning Cox Family.Mr Cordell said: “The council is committed to healthy and sustainable forms of transport and walking is one of the simplest and best ways of getting around.

He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

In other words, we are going to reward success – and reward it quite handsomely.“However, we’re not going to reward failure. We have been very clear to the players still here, and those joining, that we expect success and are happy to pay for that success. We will not continue to pay for mediocrity.”Martin has also put in a place a rule that harks back to the Jim McLean days as he wants every player to be living within 25 miles of the city.He added: “What we are saying to these professionals is we want them to live in the Dundee area.“We don’t just want them to be part of the team but also part of the club and part of the community.“We have put in place a new rule that says players need to live within a 25-mile radius of Dundee and we believe that will be a major factor in creating the spirit and collegiate nature we want to implement.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1aab9499fe4.jpg ","title":"selfless dundee schoolgirl raises 700 by forgoing birthday gifts","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA selfless schoolgirl has raised nearly £700 for a mental health charity after she asked friends to donate to the organisation instead of buying her gifts.Daisy Soutar turned 13 earlier this month and asked pals and family to pledge cash to the Scottish Association of Mental Health (SAMH).The generous teen has raised £670 for the charity, which provides support to those dealing with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.Daisy, who lives in Broughty Ferry, chose to raise money for the charity after experiencing a tough period at her old school.She now attends Grove Academy and is happier.Daisy said: “I think it’s really important to talk about your mental health.“If you keep it all inside it will just build up and you’ll have way more on your mind, and that’s never good.“It’s really important to open up and tell people how you’re feeling. When I was having a hard time I would talk to my mum a lot, and my guidance teachers at school helped, too.”She added that she hoped her money would help support those in need.“I was really sad at my old school as people were saying really mean things and it would make me cry,” she said.“I know what it’s like to have issues with your mental health.”In all Daisy, who has aspirations of becoming an

As part of the development, the land would become part of the school grounds but remain available for community use outwith school hours.The area, known as the Carse playing field, is used by the Merkinch Partnership which was established in 2006 to help support and build projects focused on the environment, culture and the arts.A new car park would service the primary school and nursery while the family centre would make use of the access and parking area off Telford Road.Monday 11 Jun 2018 6:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04042000/04042253.jpg","title":"No date yet for work to start on city eyesore","story":"\u0026nbspA QUESTION mark is hanging over a start date on work to remove a fire-damaged building blighting Inverness city centre, despite previous reassurances it would be as early as this month.Since the Eastgate Hostel went up in flames in April 2013, there has been increasing frustration over a lack of visible action at the site, which remains swathed in scaffolding,Hopes were raised in March when the owners lodged a planning application to remove the scaffolding and demolish the remaining building ahead of a rebuild.At the time a spokesman said that, if approved, work would start as early as June.But it has now emerged discussions are still on-going between Highland Council officials and the owners in a bid to resolve unforeseen issues.Concerns have also been raised by the council\u0027 building conservation and environment officer that the proposed rebuild is lower than the original.Nearby businesses are fed-up at the lack of progress.Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice is in Stephen\u0027 Brae, said it was \"beyond belief\".\"If it doesn\u0026rsquot start by the end of June, I think there are real problems and the council should take it over,\" he said.\"It has lasted far too long. There always seems to be some excuse which is holding it back.\"Barber Greg Dodds, of For Men Only, was also frustrated at the lack of information.\"It seems ridiculous,\" he said.City centre manager David Haas said talks with the agents were progressing \"constructively\" but declined to comment on a possible start date.\"There are a number of issues relating to permission we are working through with council officials and the agent,\" he said.It has emerged that the council\u0027 principal officer for building conservation and environment, Andrew Puls, has raised concerns on conservation grounds regarding the proposed rebuild.In response to the application for the proposed demolition, he states the proposed replacement building is one storey lower and would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area\".A statement issued by two of the site owners, Mr Ali and Mr Cheng, states that \"regrettably\" unforeseen issues meant the scaffolding would not now be removed in June as originally envisaged.However it also claims that \"a new way forward\" being investigated should ultimately lead to a much speedier rebuild of the fire damaged building as well as allowing the owners to deal with various matters which had arisen from the recent planning application.Monday 11 Jun 2018 6:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111980.jpg","title":"Pilot helps jet fan take to the skies","story":"\u0026nbspA BOY with a keen fascination for planes saw his dream come true when a pilot took him on a surprise trip in a vintage jet.Inverness teenager Yusuf (14) was known to the pilots at the city airport as \"the threshold lad\" because he would regularly visit the edge of runway five to take photographs of aircraft.The autistic lad, who has asked for his surname not to be published, loves to watch the Jet Provost aircraft in particular and thinks of the airport threshold as his \"happy place\" \u0026ndash convincing his mother, Mhairi, to take him there whenever things in life get tough.She said: \"His love of aviation \u0026ndash civil and military \u0026ndash has been there since he was younger, but has grown over the years into his main hobby.\"Pilot Paul Gibbs found out about Yusuf\u0027 passion for planes after his wife got talking to Mhairi by the runway during an earlier flight for the jet.

But a story like that is so dramatic that surely it would have passed down through the family.\"Mr Newton managed to track down the woman by following clues from sources such as reports of the fire in newspapers including the Inverness Courier, plus help from the family historian at the Highland Archive Centre.Having identified the butchers A\u0026ampD Macdonald, along with the location of the family farm in Glenmoriston, he subsequently discovered the great-granddaughter of Alexander Macdonald had married in Dundee in 2009 but was living in America.\"I do get a bit obsessive when it comes to researching local history,\" he conceded. \"It takes on a life of its own.\"It is like being part historian and part detective. You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful. Other contenders are Mac, Market Molly and Market Morag.A new plaque at the Market will honour the dog which was the only loss of life in the fire described by the Inverness Courier at the time as the most destructive in 40 years, causing estimated losses of \u0026pound12,000 and leaving families homeless.Monday 11 Jun 2018 6:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109726.jpg","title":"Ugliest buildings in Inverness to be redeveloped and castle converted","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA \"ONCE in a generation\" opportunity for Inverness has been grasped by Highland Council as it has confirmed plans to buy the ugly office blocks in Upper Bridge Street which have blighted the riverside for years.The Inverness Courier revealed exclusively last week how redevelopment of the site will form part of a bigger plan to create a major new tourist attraction at Inverness Castle once the courts transfer to the new justice centre in Longman Road next year.The local authority confirmed\u0026nbspon Monday\u0026nbspthat it has put together an ambitious \"\u0026pound5 million-plus\" bid to buy the office blocks and the public will be consulted over what will go in their place.A deal is about to be signed with property firm Inverness Estates which currently owns the two 1960s buildings and retail outlets underneath.The sale price is commercially sensitive at the moment, but is expected to be disclosed at the end of the month.Highland Council already owns the neighbouring museum block.It has branded the project \"Inverness Castle \u0026ndash spirit of the Highlands\" and it will feature information and stories about the Highlands, with the aim of inspiring people to visit other parts of the region. It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Monday 11 Jun 2018 6:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece.

The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

(It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.

A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.

She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7905167.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"What the papers say     June 11","story":"              Tensions after the G7 summit and impending crunch Brexit votes in the Commons top the headlines on Monday.

Changes to the Government\u0026rsquos relocation scheme mean more volunteers who served in Helmand province will be granted visas in recognition of their \u0026ldquounflinching courage at carrying out duties \u0026ldquofraught with great difficulty and danger, Gavin Williamson said.  They will be allowed to start a new life in Britain alongside their wives and children \u0026ndash with approximately 200 new visas set to be issued.  The Government has been attacked in the past for its treatment of former staff, such as interpreters, and has been accused of \u0026ldquoabandoning them following the conflict, leaving them open to intimidation.  Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Williamson said: \u0026ldquoFrontline patrol interpreters were the unsung heroes of the military campaign in Afghanistan.  \u0026ldquoI cannot be clearer in expressing our nation\u0026rsquos eternal appreciation to these brave individuals who regularly risked life and limb to help defeat our enemies and protect us from terrorists. But we owe them more than just warm words.  Current rules mean only interpreters who were still serving in December 2012 are eligible for asylum.  But the criteria is to be extended by six years \u0026ndash meaning all interpreters who were made redundant after serving at least a year on the front-line from May 2016 will be eligible to settle in the UK.  In December, defence minister Mark Lancaster said Britain\u0026rsquos policies to help Afghan interpreters remained \u0026ldquofit for purpose and properly meet our responsibilities.  But Mr Williamson said they \u0026ldquofailed to take account of the immense sacrifice and service of many who had left before (2012).

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Instead, the First Minister said the coming months should be used as an \u0026ldquoopportunity to persuade No voters of the case for Scotland maximising its potential outside the UK.  She said SNP activists should not \"worry all the time about when we might vote again\", but instead engage on the substantive arguments for independence.  The blunt message risks antagonising some of her own supporters and parts of the wider Yes movement which have been agitating for a referendum.  Around 40,000 supporters marched in support of independence in Glasgow last month, and another 10,000 marched in Dumfries last week.  In the SNP deputy leadership contest, most members cast their first preference vote for a candidate who wanted a referendum by the 2021 Holyrood election, and non-committal Economy Secretary Keith Brown only won\u0026nbspafter a redistribution of ballots.  However Ms Sturgeon, who says she has a \"triple-lock mandate\" to call a referendum by 2021, said she still expected another vote while she was First Minister.  The \u0026ldquostop obsessing message, amid opposition claims Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos independence plans have stalled, reinforced more subtle comments to the SNP conference on Saturday.  Then, Ms Sturgeon told activists that, until the \u0026ldquofog of Brexit lifted, they had a responsibility  \u0026ldquonot just to focus on the \u0026lsquowhen\u0026rsquo of independence, but to use our energy and passion to persuade those who still ask \u0026lsquowhy?\u0026rsquo Right now, that is the more important task.  After the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election, Ms Sturgeon \u0026ldquoreset her March 2017 plan for another referendum linked to Brexit.  She said she would set out her view on \u0026ldquothe precise timetable for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future when Brexit came into focus this autumn.  But on the BBC One\u0026rsquos Andrew Marr show she appeared to row back from that, saying she would not even consider the issue until there was more clarity.  The SNP leader was asked whether it was possible to have a second referendum before Scotland left the EU as part of Brexit in March 2019.  She said: \u0026ldquoAnything in life is possible, but .. I feel that the uncertainty around Brexit right now is such that we shouldn\u0026rsquot make any decisions on timing about a possible second independence referendum, and I\u0026rsquove said I won\u0026rsquot give that any further consideration until we get more clarity, which I hope will be sooner rather than later.  \u0026ldquoWhat I was saying to my party conference yesterday was let\u0026rsquos stop obsessing all of the time about when we might get the chance to vote on independence again.  \u0026ldquoInstead let\u0026rsquos engage people in the substantive arguments, let\u0026rsquos address people who still ask the question \u0026lsquowhy should Scotland be independent?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThis is a very good time to have a debate that is focused on maximising our opportunities as a country, rather than just resigning ourselves to the inevitable damage that Brexit seems destined to do to us.  Press on the timing, given Brexit could mean an independent Scotland having to reapply for EU membership, Ms Sturgeon was asked if there was enough time between her looking at the timing issue in the autumn and March 2019 to hold a referendum.  She said: \u0026ldquoNo, but even if doesn\u0026rsquot happen before then Scotland will still have options.  Asked if she was effectively ruling out a referendum until after Brexit, she said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not sure that\u0026rsquos a conclusion anybody should necessarily reach.  Ms Sturgeon also said that she was writing to Speaker John Bercow asking for a vote on the devolved \u0026lsquopower grab\u0026rsquo in the EU Withdrawal Bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday.  She said the Bill, which Holyrood has refused to endorse, was \u0026ldquounconstitutional as it stands, given the conventions which underpin devolution.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis is quite an important issue of principle. This is not about giving the Scottish Parliament new powers or extra powers, it is simply about safeguarding the powers we already have.  Later, on Sky news with Sophie Ridge, Mr Sturgeon was asked whether there would be a second referendum while she was First Minister.  She replied: \u0026ldquoI think there will be. I think Scotland will become independent. My view is that that is the direction of travel. But on the question of timing, for the last 12 months, I\u0026rsquove been saying very clearly that I don\u0026rsquot think it\u0026rsquos right to consider that decision while things are so unclear and so uncertain around Brexit.  \u0026ldquoSo as First Minister I won\u0026rsquot give consideration to the timing until we\u0026rsquove got some Brexit clarity. The message I was giving to my party at our conference is that that gives us an opportunity, not to worry all the time about when we might vote again on independence, but instead to engage on the substance of the arguments, and to address people in Scotland who still ask why we should be independent.  \u0026ldquoI think that debate is timely because there\u0026rsquos going to be change. Brexit makes that inevitable. Most people think Brexit will make the country poorer. So this is an opportunity to look at whether there\u0026rsquos a better alternative for Scotland, and focus on hope and optimism and how we maximise our potential as a country. So that\u0026rsquos the opportunity I was encouraging my party to grasp when I spoke to them yesterday.  On BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford refused to say if there would be a referendum before the next Holyrood election.  He said there needed to be more clarity over Brexit, adding: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland will determine when the time is right for that. It will happen at the right time.  Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: \u0026ldquoThe one person who needs to stop obsessing about independence is the First Minister. She could do that by taking the threat of another independence referendum off the table altogether.  \u0026ldquoThat way, the Scottish Government - for once - could concentrate on the job at hand."},{"url":null,"title":"In Pictures  Thousands take part in Edinburgh parade to mark women   s vote centenary","story":"              Thousands of women took to the streets in Scotland\u0026rsquos capital to celebrate 100 years since the first women in Britain secured the right to vote.  The Edinburgh parade was part of Processions, a mass participation artwork taking place simultaneously in the capitals of the UK to mark the achievements of the women\u0026rsquos suffrage movement.  The women and girls on the march wore suffragette colours of green, violet and white and were choreographed to appear as a moving suffragette flag.  The Edinburgh participants gathered at the Meadows before heading off through the city, ending by marching down the Royal Mile to the sounds of a piper playing Flower Of Scotland and past the Scottish Parliament.  Those taking part spanned all ages and many carried banners covering a range of causes.  These included embroidered banners thanking the \u0026ldquosister suffragettes, others proclaiming the suffragette slogans \u0026ldquoEquality for Women and \u0026ldquoDeeds Not Words and some simply stating \u0026ldquo100 years.  Modern political causes were also in evidence, with banners for the WASPI women fighting for pension equality.  Political parties were among the groups taking part in the parade, which was open to women and girls and those identifying as such, and other organisations involved included the Girl Guides and the Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Institute.  The event was produced by Artichoke and commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the UK\u0026rsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary.  Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said: \u0026ldquoProcessions is a great opportunity to celebrate the centenary of some women getting the vote, an important milestone in our country\u0026rsquos history.  \u0026ldquoAs we mark this anniversary and while we have come a long way since 1918, this event also offers an occasion for us all to reflect on the challenges and opportunities that still lie ahead.  \u0026ldquoEquality for women is at the heart of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos vision for an equal Scotland and our Programme for Government set out our ambitions, including legislating for gender balance on public sector boards, creating a new Advisory Council on Women and Girls, and piloting a returners project to help women back in to the workplace after a career break.  \u0026ldquoOur goal for all women and girls \u0026ndash in Scotland and around the world \u0026ndash is that they have a fair chance to succeed in life, no matter their gender.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the event a \u0026ldquospectacular tribute."},{"url":null,"title":"Brexit funder to be quizzed by MPs over Russia links","story":"              THE millionaire who bankrolled the Brexit campaign is to be quizzed on his newly revealed links to Russia by MPs investigating Kremlin interference in the vote.  Businessman Arron Banks, the founder of the Leave. EU group, is due to give evidence to the Commons inquiry into \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo this week.  After initially refusing, he has now agreed but says he is the victim of a \u0026ldquowitch hunt.  In his book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, Mr Banks admitted a single meeting with the Russian Ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, in September 2015.  However the Sunday Times and Observer reported an email trail revealing further meetings between the two men and Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore.  At one meeting, in November 2015, the day after the Leave.EU launch, the ambassador introduced Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore to a Russian businessman who offered a potentially highly lucrative business deal involving six Russian goldmines.  Mr Banks also visited Moscow in February 2016, during the referendum campaign.  And in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore met President-elect Donald Trump in New York, they had a lunch with the ambassador.  Mr Banks told the Sunday Times he also handed over phone numbers for members of Mr Trump\u0026rsquos transition team to Russian officials.  Damian Collins, chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said the discovery of the links was \u0026ldquobig news and very relevant to his \u0027fake news\u0026rsquo inquiry.  He told BBC Sunday Politics that the public had a \u0026ldquoright to know the nature of the contacts.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe want to understand more to what extent Mr Banks profited from his relationship with the Russian embassy. Did he make money out of it?  \u0026ldquoDid he use that money to fund campaigns? If he didn\u0027t then that\u0027s fine but given the prominent role he played we\u0027ve got the right to ask these questions.\"  Mr Banks, who gave \u0026pound12m in donations to Ukip and the Leave side, told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. It\u0026rsquos a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.  He later joked to Reuters that he was \u0026ldquostill waiting for the cheque from Moscow.  He said: \"This is just complete, absolute garbage - it is like the Salem witch hunt. They just keep on screaming \u0027witch\u0027, \u0027witch\u0027. They are trying to discredit everyone involved in Brexit.\"  Mr Wigmore said Leave.EU never offered any campaign information to any Russian.  The extent of the links with Russia was revealed in a cache of 40,000 emails shared by Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore with the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote The Bad Boys of Brexit.  She said the two men had been \u0026ldquoshamelessly used by the Russians, but that did not invalidate the judgment of the 17.4m people who voted to leave the EU.  Leave.EU was last month fined \u0026pound70,000 for breaching election law in the EU referendum.  The Electoral Commission said the group, which was separate from the official Vote Leave campaign, failed to report at least \u0026pound77,380 of its spending.  It has also referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police.  Mr Banks called it a \"politically motivated attack\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Harry and Meghan to follow in Charles and Diana   s footsteps on Australia NZ tour","story":"              The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will make an official visit to Australia, Fiji, the Kingdom of Tonga and New Zealand.

The actor described the film industry as \u0026ldquoaggressively heterosexual, adding that gay performers are treated like \u0026ldquosecond-class citizens.  Everett told the Press Association: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos tons of roles that I haven\u0026rsquot got for lots of different reasons, some of them probably for not being a good enough actor or doing a lousy audition, all that counts.  \u0026ldquoBut there were three or four big films, when I was successful, that the director and the other actors wanted me to be in and that I was absolutely blocked from by a studio, just for the fact of being gay.  \u0026ldquoThat does absolutely happen. But at the same time it has been the making of me as well.  \u0026ldquoThe struggle that has forced me to have has been great, in a way.  \u0026ldquoI think it has forced me always to try and be creative, to try and make something up.  \u0026ldquoI think my career as a writer would not have happened if I had been heterosexual, active, working non-stop.  The star of My Best Friend\u0026rsquos Wedding and the St Trinian\u0026rsquos films now serves as the writer, director and star of The Happy Prince, in which he plays Oscar Wilde living in exile after his release from prison.  Everett said: \u0026ldquoMy position of working in this aggressively heterosexual milieu of show business has definitely made me feel kind of parallel (to Wilde).  \u0026ldquoOf course I haven\u0026rsquot been put in prison and subjected to hard labour and I haven\u0026rsquot died from it but I have been constantly on the back foot, really, in my career as a gay actor.  \u0026ldquoI obviously went into this business applying for world domination and that is an impossible thing to really achieve, certainly in the 80s and 90s.  \u0026ldquoMaybe things are changing a bit now, things are loosening up and I hope they go further.  He added: \u0026ldquoI think Hollywood is a business that is made and for \u0026hellip it is just very hetero, it is very clubby and it is very male, or historically it is, so you need to fit into that to really benefit.  \u0026ldquoThis is what the women have been going on about, how compromising it feels to them to just have to fit into it.  \u0026ldquoI think that is the centrum, the bottom of the Me Too argument really.  \u0026ldquoIt is a subtle thing, taking part in a boys\u0026rsquo club \u0026ndash a straight boys\u0026rsquo club \u0026ndash and if you are a woman in it you have to bend yourself towards that world and if you are a gay in it, you are a second-class citizen, really, and subjected, at a certain point, to a brick wall, in terms of getting on.  He thinks gay actors still exist for a \u0026ldquocertain function.  \u0026ldquoMy function was as a gay best friend, a confidante, a kind of hairdresser, constantly there with the curling tongs, which is fair enough but as a performer there is not very far you can go with that before you bore everyone s**tless, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe point is, for gay performers there is no, or very little, back and forth.  \u0026ldquoIn other words, the straights can play all the gay characters they want but the gays don\u0026rsquot get much of a chance to play any straight characters because, as far as this status quo is concerned, we are still gay and no matter how macho you are, they will just still think of you probably as a gay.  The Happy Prince is released in London on June 15 and nationwide on June 22."}]
