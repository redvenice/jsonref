Between 1998 and 2008, holidaymakers from the South were allowed to visit a specially-designated section of the North, the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region. Mr Cockerell said: \u0027It\u0027s almost certainly being built for the future of South Korean tourists visiting, and domestic tourists as well.\u0027          The long beaches near Wonsan had previously been used as a missile testing site but has since been paved over\u0027There\u0027s nobody else who has the volume or potential volume of tourists to actually fill such a place or even partly fill such a place.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s hard to see who else it would be for.

But the forum has been criticised over its inaction, and before the May election the government quietly postponed fuel standard improvements for Australian refiners until 1 July 2027, in line with the petroleum industry’s demand.The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the issue of Australia’s fuel standards would be considered as part of the bilateral negotiations.“As part of the free trade negotiations we will consider everything that is put on the table. Whether we agree to it is a different matter,” Birmingham told  Australia.“It is not Australian practice to simply adopt European standards – we urge and encourage common adoption of international standards where possible.“But we will work through in a practical way any of these issues and see what may be possible in the Australian context, but ultimately we will only be doing any agreement if it is in the overall benefit of Australia.”On the likelihood that Australia’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement will need to be enshrined in the new FTA, Birmingham said Australia would be happy to comply.“Our commitment to Paris is firm and resolute and we are happy to reinforce that commitment in any forum.”Along with industrial and environmental concerns, Australia and the EU are attempting to negotiate through a host of agricultural barriers, with Australian farmers hoping to gain further access to Europe’s highly protected market.Europe is pushing for Australian action on so-called “geographic indicators”, which would prevent Australian producers using a suite of brand names it deems to be its intellectual property, such as feta, gruyere and gorgonzola.Australian cheesemakers have expressed concern that the proposed ban on product names could require expensive rebranding and cost jobs.Asked about the progress being made on the FTA, negotiations for which began in June 2018, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was “complex”.“It is just step by step by step by step,” he said. “But there is a real keenness to engage with Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25955f8af9788cfecdaed683a910003bd0752613/0_138_2460_1476/master/2460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b42398fe3317c8a1997f98ee2cf9bb","title":"harry potter books removed from catholic school on exorcists advice","story":"Pastor at St Edward junior school in Nashville says JK Rowling’s use of ‘actual spells’ risks conjuring evil spirits. A Catholic junior school in Nashville has removed the Harry Potter books from its library, saying they include “actual curses and spells, which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits”.Local paper the Tennessean reported that the pastor at St Edward Catholic school had emailed parents about JK Rowling’s series to tell them that he had been in contact with “several” exorcists who had recommended removing the books from the library.“These books present magic as both good and evil, which is not true, but in fact a clever deception,” Rev Dan Reehil wrote. “The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.”Curses and spells included in the bestselling books, which were published between 1997 and 2007, include “avada kedavra”, the “killing” curse “crucio”, the torture curse and “imperio”, which allows the wizards to control others’ actions.Rebecca Hammel, superintendent of schools for the Catholic diocese of Nashville, told the Tennessean that Reehil had sent the email after an inquiry from a parent. She added that “he’s well within his authority to act in that manner”, because “each pastor has canonical authority to make such decisions for his parish school”.According to the paper, the books were on shelves until the end of the previous term, but the school has just opened a new library from which they were removed.“I know that in the process they were going through and kind of weeding out some of the content in hopes of sprucing it up and improving the circulation,” said Hammel, adding that if parents deemed the stories “to be appropriate we would hope that they would just guide their sons and daughters to understand the content through the lens of our faith”.She added: “We really don’t get into censorship in such selections other than making sure that what we put in our school libraries are age-appropriate materials for our classrooms.”The Harry Potter books have drawn censure from Christians ever since the first in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, was released in 1997. In 1999, it was the most challenged book in the US, and the series topped the American Library Association’s list of the most frequently challenged books of 2000-2009.Challengers asserted that the books “glorified magic and the occult, confusing children and leading them to attempt to emulate the spells and curses they read about”, said the ALA. In 2001, the pastor of Christ Community Church in Alamogordo, New Mexico oversaw a book burning of the Potter books, and a local library responded with a dedicated display, telling the public that “Harry is alive and well at their library”.While he was still a cardinal in 2003, the future Pope Benedict XVI described the books as “subtle seductions which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul before it can grow properly”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82063961c4bdaea6caa9f08e326396a4fa6440ee/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c84bdfce9dfee7674f0e875b9ea9e4c","title":"bank hsbc uk homebuyers bank mortgage","story":"Battle between lenders intensifies as bank seeks bigger share of mortgage marketHSBC is to lend an extra £35bn to homeowners, further intensifying the battle among mortgage lenders to offer ultra-competitive deals to customers.Rivals have claimed that HSBC’s aggressive push into the mortgage market will squeeze profit margins in the sector amid intense competition for customers.The result has been a boon to mortgage hunters seeking good deals but has forced some lenders, such as Tesco Bank and the consumer body Which?, to quit the mortgage market.“There are many critics, usually other banks, saying that we are being overly competitive in the market, and we are desperately trying to get share,” said Stuart.The number of new home loan deals that offer some sort of incentive to pull in customers, such as cashback, free valuation or free legal fees, have risen sharply as competition has intensified.In May, the financial data provider Moneyfacts said there were 1,518 mortgages offering an added incentive, significantly up from the 920 in the same month in 2017.Stuart said the bank’s mortgage strategy was based on efficiency and customer service, not just attempting to out-price rivals with cheaper deals. “Rather than taking seven weeks to get a mortgage, it now takes you about five days – that’s pretty slick,” he said. “It’s not a price-driven strategy it’s a good quality products, well executed strategy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e236e820f4607243b9ed8f2809e3bcccf9f7c29/0_122_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ecdf44611f7903732e7c2a808254cc","title":"uk factory output brexit eu manufacturers","story":"Survey finds EU-based firms shunning UK manufacturers as risk of no deal mountsThe UK’s manufacturers have recorded the sharpest drop in factory output for seven years as mounting concerns over no-deal Brexit and the slowing global economy hit orders across the country.The monthly snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which is closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signals from the UK economy, showed that activity plunged in August to the lowest levels since July 2012.The report found that EU-based customers are shunning British manufacturers as the risk of no-deal Brexit mounts, rerouting supply chains away from the UK as the likelihood of border disruption after 31 October increases.Orders from the US and Asia have fallen as the world economy slows, in a sign of the tough challenge facing the UKto strike new trade deals outside the economic bloc.The IHS MarkitCips manufacturers purchasing managers’ index (PMI) plunged to 47.4 in August, down from 48.0 a month earlier. Anything above 50.0 separates economic growth from contraction.Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Neil Foster, a research and policy officer at the GMB trade union, said: “Crashing out of the EU without a deal would cause mayhem, delays and increase costs for our importers, exporters and their supply chains.“The government should be working to rebuild confidence, instead ministers are risking more and more decent manufacturing jobs with their reckless approach.”There were steep reductions in new orders across several industries, against a backdrop of heightened political chaos and falling export demand across the world amid the US-China trade war.Global factory output has plunged into recession in recent months as the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies intensifies, which has dented economic growth in several major industrialised nations.The UK has fallen to the bottom of the G7 growth league table, while growth in Germany has gone into reverse and Italy stalled over the second quarter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f916bd3e9610f6b6b434b0a64fc767bd2b9a6b4/0_139_5314_3188/master/5314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c82dc197d4b62658403d404d278d52d0","title":"queer teenager great yarmouth books","story":"This was where I came to understand the power and burden of my sexuality – and I revisited the place in all three of my booksI ricocheted across Britain from the fishing working class of Aberdeen where I was born. Up and down the country we went, taking in mining villages in Northumbria, Canterbury, North Lanarkshire and finally Norfolk, by the time I was 15. My childhood involved more than nine primary schools (I eventually lost count), five secondary schools and more council houses, B\u0026ampBs and private slum flats than anyone’s should. The woman I am is the sum of all the challenges, kindnesses and observed tenacity from those less written-about streets, as much as it is the product of my adventures in an adulthood spent nomadically in Hanoi, Buenos Aires, Berlin and Budapest. But Great Yarmouth is the town that made me and broke me in equal measure.If you live in the south, you may have visited it in your childhood. The name will conjure up the smell of hot, sugared doughnuts, sea salt-scratchy hair, the adrenalin fizz of cascading 2p coins in neon-lit arcades, the swoop of the rickety rollercoaster at the pleasure beach. Maybe in later years, but not recently, you’ll have gone to a hen or stag do there, drinking your way through £2 doubles and syrupy shots until you stagger back to a garishly decorated B\u0026ampB with a thin, lumpy duvet.It’s unlikely you will have seen it in the winter, though, when the town empties and slows and the party stops. When those who’ve had seasonal work go to the jobcentre beside Tesco and the town takes on a morning-after feeling of hangover and regret, but keeps on drinking anyhow.We moved there from Coatbridge, a small, post-industrial town in North Lanarkshire, in 1995, at the tail end of one of the last good summer seasons Great Yarmouth would have. Then the seafront swarmed with tourists squeezing whatever enjoyment they could from their long weekends. The Sea Life centre’s sound system and cuddly toy-grabber machines’ droning of “Oh, my darling Clementine” joining in a symphony with commercial pop – Boom, Boom, Boom by The Outhere Brothers and Shy Guy by Diana King were the tunes of that summer.The three of us – Mum, me, my little sister – moved into two tiny adjoining rooms in a B\u0026ampB called Seashells or Sea Breeze or similar, a street away from the beach. I was 14, and newly relieved of my virginity by a sweet Catholic boy in Scotland. I was only just starting to understand what power and burden female sexuality would bestow, along with the severe limitation of being born not just poor but also a woman.In Great Yarmouth I got my first job for £1.50 an hour, serving up kiddies’ meals in a greasy spoon. I managed to keep it a few weeks beyond the season’s end because the 50-year-old, pony-tailed owner liked to see me bend over to fetch the bread rolls. But that job gave me my first understanding of the clout of earning your own money. The freedom from the constant, grinding counting of every penny. In my school, a little out of town and deemed marginally better than the local high school, I learned the harshness of group mentality and the danger of being different, but I also had a teacher who gave me Sylvia Plath and JD Salinger, who cared enough to find books that inspired us and to create an environment in which we might learn.The “kiss me quick” sexual permissiveness that seemed, thanks to my hormone-drenched teens, to pervade the atmosphere also allowed me to understand my sexuality, my queerness, without too much slut-shaming. And though I also experienced the darker side of that permissive culture – I was raped and sexually assaulted twice in my late teens – I remain grateful to have come of age in a place where sex was mostly seen as a pleasure, as something everyone did whenever they felt like it, with whomever they felt like doing it with. There were gay bars, too, where, at 16, with bright blue nails and glitter on my face, I was welcomed warmly by older gay men who celebrated my newfound curiosity in a way I doubt I would have experienced in a bigger city.It’s perhaps no surprise that Great Yarmouth and its heady excesses would come to shape me, would sink into my marrow so deep that I would continually revisit the town in all three of my books.• Kerry Hudson is the author of Lowborn"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e5953626c25cb9a0fe9eab659805220ef6d924d/249_0_2803_1683/master/2803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b04086b16918d7943768ac1e0d4acb","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smoky","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smoky’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smoky’.Share your photos of what smoky means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 September at 10am.

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours. Our favourite to date has to be the brownie cheesecake! But if you’re not in Ontario, check out Lucky’s Doughnuts at the 49th Parallel Café in BC or family-owned business, Bronuts in Winnipeg.

You’ll have to move to, or at least visit, the Northwest Territories to make it happenIn Canada’s Northwest Territories, polar bears abound – in the form of number plates. In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first. But since then, many have become delighted and wanted one for themselves. Pro tip: we’ve seen some vintage plates sold on eBay.If you want to branch out into road signs, then there are more than 77,000 to be seen at Watson Lake Signpost Forest.

Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018.

Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currencyIn the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.Fly WestJet to discover (and enjoy!) the weird and the wonderful things in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00acda3e2b9cfe958f5c32949fa306157f0e5dae/0_1438_2681_1607/master/2681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b31d2f626b9e67eae287a93f0cc651ee","title":"wow factors 10 unmissable experiences in and around canadas greatest cities","story":"Get your fill of adrenalin-rush activities across Canada, with cave exploration, axe throwing and rodeos all in the mixCanada’s 10 provinces and three territories cover nearly 10m square kilometers and extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, to the Arctic Ocean – meaning there’s a whole lot of country to explore.

I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder.”She said she had not been open about her diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum in order to “hide” behind it, but because she knew “many ignorant people still see it as an ‘illness’, or something negative”.“When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you’re winning!” she wrote, using the hashtag #aspiepower.While acknowledging that her diagnosis has limited her before, she said it “sometimes makes me a bit different from the norm” and she sees being different as a “superpower”.Asperger’s syndrome was named after the Austrian paediatrician, Hans Asperger, who, in the 1940s, described some of its characteristics, including difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, including difficulties reading body language. In 2013, Asperger’s was folded into the wider diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.Tony Attwood, a world authority on Asperger’s, has said people diagnosed are “usually renowned for being direct, speaking their mind and being honest and determined and having a strong sense of social justice”.Boys are more widely diagnosed than girls.Thunberg was diagnosed four years ago. She has acknowledged that her passion for her climate crisis work was partly down to viewing the world in stark terms.In July, Thunberg hit back at the Australian News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt for writing a deeply offensive column that mocked her diagnosis.He criticised her two-week trip across the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht because, he said “she refuses to fly and heat the planet with an aeroplane’s global warming gasses”.Bolt repeatedly referred to Greta’s mental health, saying she was “deeply disturbed”.Thunberg responded by tweeting that she was “deeply disturbed” by the “hate and conspiracy campaigns” run by climate deniers like Bolt.On Friday Thunberg was joined by crowds of American teenagers at a protest outside the UN headquarters in New York following her transatlantic crossing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b57b9bed4b4796a894c829ab848e18d0f335e8/943_866_4421_2652/master/4421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5033c24b0b7da1eab61a41d263c205bc","title":"river thames home to 138 baby seals latest count finds","story":" It has been a highway, a sewer and was declared biologically dead in the 1950s but the River Thames is now a nursery for 138 baby seals, according to the first comprehensive seal pup count.Scientists from the Zoological Society of London analysed photographs taken from light aircraft to identify and count harbour seal pups, which rest on sandbanks and creeks in the Thames downstream from London during the summer, shortly after they are born.“We were thrilled to count 138 pups born in a single season, said the conservation biologist Thea Cox. “The seals would not be able to pup here at all without a reliable food source, so this demonstrates that the Thames ecosystem is thriving and shows just how far we have come since the river was declared biologically dead in the 1950s.”The Thames is home to both grey seals and harbour seals, although only the latter breed there. The seals can feed on more than 120 species of fish in the Thames, including salmon, two species of shark, short-snouted seahorses and the European eel, which is critically endangered. Other marine mammals spotted in the Thames include porpoises, dolphins and “Benny” the beluga whale.Anna Cucknell of ZSL said: “The restored ‘Mother Thames’ – as we call her – is an essential nursery habitat. Harbour seal pups can swim within hours of birth, which means they are well adapted to grow up in tidal estuaries, like the Thames. By the time the tide comes in they can swim away on it. Grey seals, on the other hand, take longer to be comfortable in the water, so breed elsewhere and come to the Thames later to feed.”ZSL has conducted Thames seal population estimates annually since 2013. The most recent results, from 2017, recorded 1,104 harbour seals and 2,406 grey seals across the estuary.The surveys show that seal numbers are rising but it is not yet known if this is due to resident seals having pups or adults moving in from other areas.The seal pup survey, which was undertaken in 2018, aims to help ZSL researchers better understand the causes of changes in the Thames seal population."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da47c888c55040252c06299761e7e20406d573ae/0_315_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e311ea6517004df8e10b5b924bd03db","title":"uk funding to tackle climate emergency needs to more than double","story":"Charities write to Sajid Javid requesting increase of spending from £17bn to £42bn over next three yearsBritain’s biggest environmental groups have warned the government that funding to tackle the climate emergency must be more than double next year to avoid an even greater cost from catastrophic ecological breakdown in the future.Writing to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as he prepares to announce on Wednesday his spending priorities for the year ahead, more than a dozen leading environment charities, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as other leading organisations such as Oxfam and Christian Aid, said urgent action was required to raise spending.Spelling out their demands in a costed roadmap for meeting the climate emergency, the groups said that government spending needed to increase from roughly £17bn a year at present to at least £42bn over the next three years. Further increases would be required in the future should the government wish to meet its promise of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Although broadly welcoming the 2050 target, promised by Theresa May among the final acts of her premiership, the charities said the date needed to be brought forward by several years and that policy and funding arrangements were not yet in place.In the letter to Javid, the organisations urged the chancellor to demonstrate that he understood the gravity of the challenge by holding a climate and nature emergency budget to unleash a clean industrial revolution in Britain.Also signed by charities including the Woodland Trust, WWF and Islamic Relief, the letter said higher state investment would encourage more private spending to bring about a low-carbon economy, telling Javid: “Your department holds the key to ending the UK’s contribution to climate change and reversing nature’s retreat, while also setting off a positive economic transformation.”Boris Johnson had said there would be greater funding for big infrastructure projects but without giving specific details for low-carbon schemes. Polling carried out for the charities by Opinium found a majority of people want ministers to spend more on the climate emergency and nature more broadly.Among the priorities put forward by the groups are an £11.6bn expansion in transport spending, including a UK-wide car scrappage scheme to remove heavily-polluting vehicles from the roads.As much as £2.6bn per year should be spent on rewilding projects and other land management schemes, billions should be ploughed into buildings and industry to boost environmental sustainability, while more funding should be given to help communities disrupted by the transition to a low-carbon economy.John Sauven, an economist and executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “No one in government is still trying to argue that this is not an emergency, and yet no one in government is acting as though it is.“We are still constantly pumping carbon into the atmosphere, and trying to ignore the problem will leave our children with a damaged world and a planet-sized debt. There’s a strong economic case and an overwhelming moral imperative for the chancellor to act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

It provides another deep e into the hidden world of the Vatican City, marvelling at its mystique with agnostic fervour. The Venice film festival screened two episodes of the forthcoming eight-part series, each preceded by an abridged summary of what went before. But even in this bowdlerised form, it looks splendid, like Michelangelo’s Pietà, which is scarred by a terrorist bomb at the top of episode seven.The New Pope (a co-production by Sky Atlantic, HBO and Canal+) picks up where The Young Pope left off, with Pius XIII (Jude Law) in a coma and the Holy See scurrying to come up with a replacement. The most viable candidate is Sir John Brannox (beautifully embodied by John Malkovich), an intellectual English aristo renowned for a theological text, The Middle Way, that he wrote in his youth. On arriving at his stately pile, with its shades of Brideshead Revisited, the Catholic delegates are drawn into a realm that is almost as arcane and thick with secrets as the one they’ve left behind in Rome. Brannox lounges at its centre, apparently all-knowing and all-seeing. “He’s persuasive, seductive. He envelops you,” remarks the Holy See’s marketing chief Sofia (Cécile de France). “The man seems to be made of velvet.”As with the man, so with the series. Sorrentino possesses style to burn and elegance to squander. The New Pope loops and darts from one gorgeous set piece to the next, whether it’s a religious tableau set to haunting dance music or a nocturnal stroll through a wintry Venice. The whole thing is so immaculate that it risks holding the viewer at arm’s length. But then the director will gently lance us with a moment of emotional truth, drawing our attention to the pensive old cardinal who was abused as a boy, or the emaciated child in the bed of a supposedly cursed house. Sorrentino’s grand mansion contains many doors. Crucially, we are made to feel that behind each is a story that would merit its own standalone drama.Pope Pius XIII maybe mouldering in the hospital but his presence walks the corridors of this show. Law appears in ghostly form, laying a consoling hand on a shoulder or parading in Speedos on the beach at the Lido. (Sorrentino has always relished juggling the profound with the profane.) It’s good to have him back, but on the evidence of two episodes, I’m more taken with the new arrival. Malkovich plays delicate Brannox with a purring, campy charisma resplendent in a purple suit, a smudge of mascara beneath watchful eyes. When he’s not reclining on the chaises longues, Brannox likes sitting upright on a stool, caressing his harp. Plop him on a toadstool and pass the man a hookah. He’d be a dead ringer for the caterpillar out of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.•The New Pope screened at the Venice film festival it will be broadcast on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab28cd1983d5daeff60cd5302da85e1569ccdac6/0_130_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e2f863f1defcb5a693c3daa5dcac6dc","title":"thomasina miers recipe for tomato cheese and tarragon galette","story":"Lincolnshire Poacher is a strong, hard cheese that is wonderful melted into the season’s vine tomatoes in this crumbly tartThere is a glut of tomatoes and I am making full use of them while I can.

He raised an arm to acknowledge supporters singing his name, but needed both hands on his crutches as he lowered himself into his seat, trying not to place too much weight on a heavily strapped right knee.Chiellini had ruptured his cruciate ligament in training one day before. A painful personal setback, and a potential catastrophe for his team. The Juventus captain is expected to be out of action for at least the next five months. For a 35-year-old footballer, such injuries can curtail a career.His absence from the starting XI to face Napoli on Saturday was already a major setback. These were the champions’ closest rivals: the team that finished as runners-up in three of the past four seasons. Juventus were still adjusting to life under a new manager, Maurizio Sarri, who was unable to take up his own place on the touchline after contracting pneumonia in pre-season.It ought to have been a vulnerable moment for Italian football’s Old Lady. But sometimes La Vecchia Signora looks an awful lot like the Roman goddess Fortuna – the original Lady Luck.Juventus opened the scoring in the 16th minute through summer recruit Danilo, who had only stepped on the pitch moments earlier as a replacement for the injured Mattia De Sciglio.Of course, the goal was not all down to chance. Napoli were negligent, conceding from their own corner. Lorenzo Insigne’s shot was blocked by Leonardo Bonucci, and his teammates were too slow to react as Danilo released Douglas Costa on the counter before arriving in the penalty box to convert the return pass. He had been on the pitch for 29 seconds in this, his Juventus debut.Defence was supposed to be a strength for Napoli this season, after they signed Kostas Manolas to play alongside Kalidou Koulibaly at centre-back. Yet the latter player was left flat-footed as Gonzalo Higuaín made it 2-0 with a sharp turn and finish moments later. The game looked to be up when Cristiano Ronaldo added a third shortly after the hour mark.Instead, Napoli would drag themselves back level during a remarkable 15-minute burst, then throw all their hard work away in injury time. Manolas headed in from a free-kick, before Hirving Lozano – making his own debut as a second-half substitute – slotted home from a José Callejón cross. Carlo Ancelotti raised both eyebrows as Giovanni Di Lorenzo arrived at the back post on another set-piece. Suddenly, the score was 3-3.The comeback narrative was laced with juicy subplots. Chiellini’s replacement, the €75m summer signing Matthijs De Ligt, had endured a calamitous debut: losing his man on all three of Napoli’s goals. We can be lenient in our judgements of a 20-year-old defender playing in a new team and an unfamiliar league, while still acknowledging that the captain is going to be missed.Juve’s best player was Higuaín, a defining figure in the recent rivalry between these two clubs. Sarri’s first title challenge with Napoli was built on the striker’s record-breaking 2015-16 campaign, before the Argentinian joined the Bianconeri. The goals he scored over the next two seasons were crucial to keeping the Scudetto out of his former manager’s hands.Now their fates are once again intertwined. Few people expected Higuaín to have a role at Juventus following disappointing loan spells at Milan and Chelsea, yet he started at centre-forward on Saturday just as he had on the opening weekend. Even before scoring, he had created problems for Koulibaly with intelligent movement outside the penalty box. He teed up Sami Khedira for a golden chance that went begging at 2-0, as well.At one point, Higuaín was applauded even for a missed pass, because fans recognised his intent. A louder ovation was offered when he came off in the 76th minute.Di Lorenzo’s equaliser arrived soon after, but there was a further twist yet to come. In injury time, Juventus won a free-kick 40 yards from goal. Their own players barely reacted as Miralem Pjanic heaved a last hopeful ball into the Napoli box. Koulibaly, however, attacked it decisively at the near post. The ball caught his shin and flew into the top corner of the net.It was a freakish mistake that capped a night to forget for a player who has known the very different emotion of scoring a 90th-minute winner for his own team at the Allianz Stadium. Koulibaly was Serie A’s best centre-back last season, but this was an occasion when – with Chiellini watching from the stands – both teams forgot how to defend.The Juventus captain came down on his crutches to console his opponent after the final whistle: a show of empathy from one great player to another. “I used to hate him,” confessed Sarri’s No 2, Giovanni Martusciello. “Because playing against us he was a real ball-buster. But I have got to know an extraordinary lad … after the injury, he was the one who gave us courage.”Juventus will need more than just that to win a ninth consecutive Scudetto. They can draw plenty of encouragement from an early win over a direct rival, but for a team that only conceded 13 goals at home last season to ship three in their first game without Chiellini ought to set alarm bells ringing as well. There is little that feels settled about a team whose new manager has thus far been forced to work at arm’s length. With Antonio Contes Inter sitting alongside them at the top and Napoli boasting plenty of room for growth, there is much that feels unfamiliar yet.• A new campaign, but the same grim story at Cagliari, where Romelu Lukaku was targeted with racist abuse – just as Moise Kean was last season and Blaise Matuidi the year before. At least this time we did not hear any Inter players seek to apportion blame to their teammate. But what should we expect, given that no punishment was handed down to Cagliari for the previous incident – after which the club’s president, Tommaso Giulini, rejected all accusations of racism and accused the media of false moralising?• Two goals in two games for Lukaku. His was not an especially well-rounded performance, but he did help win the penalty, which he converted, with his through-ball for Stefano Sensi.• A surreal Rome derby on Sunday, with the two teams combining to hit the woodwork six times – and five in the first 25 minutes alone. Lazio were better and look more ready to challenge for the top four. Joaquín Correa and Ciro Immobile are ever more comfortable, and dangerous, as a front two. But Roma are great fun to watch under Paulo Fonseca.• Level with Juventus and Inter are Torino. Walter Mazzarri’s team bounced back impressively from their Europa League exit by recovering from 2-1 down to win at Atalanta.• An eye-catching win for Sassuolo, too, who thrashed Sampdoria 4-1. Samp, of course, managed by their former manager Eusebio Di Francesco …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf15bf8651d9e7e7c58e4bb17260a309b6e076df/0_88_3987_2392/master/3987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6373d311295f83294ed9e8404797204","title":"union berlin rock german football with the scalp of dortmund","story":"It hasn’t taken Union long to make an indelible mark that threatens to change projections for the Bundesliga as a whole“Berlin’s football world,” wrote Berliner Morgenpost’s Michael Färber on Sunday morning, “is upside down.” A look at the fledgling Bundesliga suggests as much, with Union in comfortable mid-table, a position they would give their eye teeth to be in come the end of the campaign, with Hertha only kept off the foot of the table by Mainz, who are yet to register a point.That’s not it though – and not just because tables are of limited relevance three games into the season. Saturday night’s events in Köpenick, in the south-east of Berlin, didn’t just rock Union, or football in the capital, but the whole of Germany. In Union’s debut season among the elite, it hasn’t taken them long to make an indelible mark that threatens to change projections not only for their season, but for the Bundesliga’s as a whole.It wasn’t just that Urs Fischer’s side registered their first top-flight win, when on Saturday morning you’d have been forgiven for casting your eyes down their forthcoming fixtures and wondering how they might find a way of getting it before autumn set in. It wasn’t even that their victims were Borussia Dortmund, thought by many to be ready for an even sturdier push for the Bundesliga title following last season’s near miss.It was that this was a win that wasn’t stolen, not feverishly clutched while under siege, but deserved. “The manner of the win pleased me the most,” said Fischer. Before the break – a performance that, interestingly, the coach was underwhelmed by – his team had played with the punch and defiance of a newly-promoted underdog, spritely and dangerous from set-pieces.Dortmund had been through similar the week before at Köln, caught on the hop by the home side’s lack of deference. In Union’s case, the planning was clear in the execution, with Christopher Trimmel’s pulled-back corner swept in by Marius Bülter, Darren Anderton to Teddy Sheringham-style, to give the hosts the lead.Last Friday Dortmund had toughed it out, and eventually ground down and outclassed an exhausted Köln. Although Paco Alcácer’s equaliser had suggested they would do the same and prevail at the Alte Försterei, Union simply wouldn’t have it. There was only one team in it after the interval. Bülter gave them the lead back with another wonderfully crafted finish before Sebastian Andersson, who had scored the team’s first-ever Bundesliga goal at Augsburg last week, doubled up with a smart, side-footed finish from Sheraldo Becker’s cross. The visitors rarely looked like getting back into it.This wasn’t totally without precedent. Union had been the better side for swathes of last week’s match at Augsburg, before Keven Schlotterbeck’s late red card made them change tack and settle for a point. Still, few would have predicted that the green shoots in Bavaria would bloom so quickly.Saturday was, to all intents and purposes, Union’s first proper stab hosting a grown-up Bundesliga dinner party. The opening day against Leipzig had represented a torrent of feelings from so many different directions, from fans brandishing images of late friends and relatives who couldn’t be there to the protest against the visitors and what they are perceived to stand for during the game’s first 15 minutes. They were extraordinary, arresting sights and coupled with playing elite opposition in a huge step up, it was just too much. The match – and its context - was “emotionally overloaded”, as Färber put it.This time, they were ready. Union kept 14 clean sheets in the Bundesliga 2 last season and while the level is a different one, the grit in the team’s DNA is clear. Not that Fischer should be described as purely a defensive coach. This is a man who spent his last job before coming to Germany winning championships with Basel and if Lucien Favre picked a top-heavy line-up committed to taking to the points from Köpenick, Fischer showed his guts by pairing Andersson with Anthony Ujah. Two up top against one of the favourites for the Bundesliga? “Nehmt euer herz in beide hände!” (take your heart in both hands), the buzzphrase for the promotionrelegation play-off with Stuttgart had said, and it was present on fans’ T-shirts dotted around on Saturday, which were given away pre-kick-off. Their players and staff appeared keen to honour the motto.Ujah, Christian Gentner and Neven Subotić promise to be key figures for Union this season, a sizeable pinch of top-flight experience added to the mix of first-timers goalscorer Bülter was playing in the fourth tier for Rödinghausen little more than a year ago. None was more important against Dortmund than Subotić on what was an emotional day for him, facing the club he went through so much with during a decade at Westfalen titles, a Champions League final (famously alongside Mats Hummels, who he faced here) and a serious knee injury that severely compromised his best level.After 18 months at Saint-Étienne, the 30-year-old is looking more like his old self in slightly more modest surroundings. It’s early but the signs are good. Since Subotić has been installed in the starting XI – he was an unused sub on the opening day against Leipzig – Union have looked tough to break down. Fischer and the team will hope his renaissance continues.As a clearly touched Subotić received a warm reception from both sets of fans at the game’s conclusion, it was hard to think of anywhere he’d rather be, and the same might be said for many neutrals, drinking in such a rich atmosphere. “It’s what makes both clubs special,” Subotić told Deutsche Welle. “For the fans it’s not a hobby. It’s part of their life and identity.” We already knew, from a few early impressions, what Union were adding to the Bundesliga. Now they’ve shown us that there’s a football team beyond the ideology.• While Dortmund struggled without the guiding hand of the injured Axel Witsel, Bayern took a week off leaning solely on Robert Lewandowski. They trailed for half-an-hour at home to Mainz, but still ended up 6-1 winners, with players other than the Pole getting on the scoresheet for the first time this season in the Bundesliga. Niko Kovač’s hand in proceedings was also clear – Joshua Kimmich and Niklas Süle both said the coach’s pep talk during a first-half water break had provided the kick into gear that Bayern needed, in a week when Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge’s forthcoming exits were made official.• One wondered how Schalke would score. Then Hertha donated two own goals to help them towards David Wagner’s first win. Elsewhere, the indomitable Bas Dost scored 11 minutes into his Bundesliga return to help Eintracht Frankfurt towards victory over Fortuna Düsseldorf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/474c4d595fc591c81849573ffac6412fd6a584e3/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28141ce11ff670d434bc43ab68c54750","title":"premier league talking points weekend action","story":"There are defensive issues for Arsenal, Bournemouth, Chelsea and Manchester City, while Fabinho shone for LiverpoolYou have to wonder what was going through the minds of the Arsenal hierarchy over the summer when they belatedly decided that David Luiz was the answer to their defensive issues. There is no doubting the positives of the Brazilian’s play David Luiz can change games with his passing and prowess in the opposition box but his propensity for switching off is there for all to see. Unai Emery played three defensive midfielders at home against Tottenham, and one suspects he has limited faith in his defence, as proved by the counterattack for the opener, which saw David Luiz wander off and an unmarked Christian Eriksen tap into an empty net after a goalkeeping error. At least January is not too far away and Arsenal can plan once more to solve their problems, preferably not with a deadline-day signing. Will UnwinChelsea’s inexperience is one reason why they are dropping points but Frank Lampard also has concerns over one of his most seasoned players. César Azpilicueta has gone off the boil in recent months and the right-back had another poor game in the 2-2 draw with Sheffield United. The 30-year-old’s lack of confidence was evident when Enda Stevens zigzagged past him to tee up Callum Robinson just after half‑time, and he was unable to block the cross that led to Kurt Zouma’s own goal handing United a point in the 89th minute. Those slips will surely not have escaped Lampard’s attention and although Azpilicueta has mostly been a reliable performer since joining in 2012, he could benefit from a spell out of the side. The case grows every week for Reece James, another of Chelsea’s aspiring academy products, to be given a chance when he has recovered from an ankle injury. Jacob SteinbergRoy Hodgson left his post-match media duties on Saturday night to walk straight into a meeting with one of Crystal Palace’s major shareholders, the American Josh Harris. So it was perhaps indicative of what the manager had on his mind that he had volunteered a reminder to the press that the club’s summer pursuit of forward reinforcements had been frustrated. Those issues would not be masked by the team’s best start in four years. “We’re not a bad football team, we looked dangerous and, although we didn’t get the centre‑forward we were hoping to get in the transfer window, we still have good firepower up front,” said Hodgson. “And we still have our powder dry and maybe a player will come up in January.” Harris and his compatriot David Blitzer are open to selling their stakes but, if that is has not been achieved by January, they will be clearly pressed to sanction further investment in this team. Dominic FifieldGiven the praise lavished on Harry Wilson in recent weeks, it is only fair to observe that he did nothing at Leicester on Saturday. That can happen with young players. More concerning was that Bournemouth suffered from an old problem. The team who conceded as many away goals last season as relegated Fulham and Huddersfield left themselves daftly open at the King Power Stadium. Partly that could be attributed to absences enforced by injury. But it was also down to an approach that played into Leicester’s hands. Eddie Howe’s attacking instincts are great but he needs to find a better balance when his teams go on the road, especially against sides who thrive on counterattacking. He also needs better defenders. Whatever happened to that Tyrone Mings guy that Bournemouth had but seldom used? Oh. Paul DoyleIf Aymeric Laporte is, as Pep Guardiola fears, ruled out for the long term with the knee injury he sustained against Brighton, Manchester City have a defensive headache. Although John Stones should return soon it will still leave the champions with two senior centre-backs, the loss of Laporte and the departure of Vincent Kompany cutting a swathe from their resources. Fernandinho can fill in and Guardiola suggested Kyle Walker might too but there is a risk they may regret not replacing Kompany – something Guardiola claimed they could not do. “Sometimes we cannot afford it like other teams,” he said. “The club tell me: ‘You have a limit, you cannot go forward, maybe in the future but not now’ … so we are going with what we have.” He made a point of mentioning City’s academy and name-checked two teenage defenders, Eric Garcia and Taylor Harwood-Bellis. Perhaps that was more of a message to City’s powers that be before January it would be a stretch for them to complete a season looking this thin. Nick AmesA crowd of 44,157 remains beyond the dreams of several Premier League clubs but, at Newcastle, it spells apathy and disillusionment. This was the lowest league attendance for a top-tier game at St James’ Park since December 2012. It was no surprise to Joe Halliday, a spokesman for the pressure group “Empty for Ashley”, which encourages fans to boycott games in a bid to force Newcastle’s unloved owner to sell up. “We’re becoming a zombie club,” Halliday said. “Thousands of fans didn’t renew their season tickets and are unwilling to continue filling Mike Ashley’s pockets. The lack of ambition shown by the current ownership is leading to fans turning their backs on a club they once loved – it’s heartbreaking.” If an underwhelming draw did not help Steve Bruce to confound his critics, Watford’s first point of the season almost certainly saved Javi Gracia’s job – at least for now . Louise TaylorSouthampton did not exactly blow the Manchester United house down but, despite their equaliser coming via 6ft 6in defender Jannik Vestergaard, there were a few green shoots in terms of Ralph Hasenhüttl’s attacking ammunition. Danny Ings and Che Adams may have contributed only a single goal between them in five matches but were unrelenting in their work-rate without having anything to show for it at St Mary’s. “I would have more problems with them if they did not even have a chance to score,” Hasenhüttl said. “They had chances so I am confident. Don’t forget they work so hard against the ball.” Coupled with Sofiane Boufal – who has shown glimpses of talent since being reintegrated into the first team – Moussa Djenepo, Nathan Redmond and Shane Long, there are no shortage of options in Saints’ forward ranks. Ben FisherIt was only one game and Norwich were particularly obliging opponents, but West Ham gave a glimpse of exciting possibilities. Their front four started together for the second time and recorded a second win in the process. Sébastien Haller, Andriy Yarmolenko, Manuel Lanzini and pick of the bunch, Felipe Anderson, all bring different skills to the table and each blended harmoniously against the Canaries. Anderson’s runs with the ball, Yarmalenko’s runs without, Lanzini’s passing and Haller’s hold-up play all made a difference. More than that, they worked hard and to Manuel Pellegrini’s tactical plan. Constantly interchanging possessions, they befuddled Norwich’s defence. They doubled up on the flanks, not only nullifying the Canaries’ expansive full-backs but robbing them of the ball. The quartet showed an understanding that belied the short time they have been together and, as Pellegrini suggested, delivered the kind of display he hopes his side can deliver on a regular basis this season.

Indeed, she’s recently returned from a holiday in Majorca during which she hopped over to Ibiza and was snapped clubbing with her news colleague, Simon McCoy. One might even say she looks pretty perky.She was referring to that moment in a battle when you have to convince your opponent that you are willing to do what it takes to achieve your goal that you will not blink, or back down, or slink away. And on 4 June 2018, when her grievance appeal was turned down with no further option but litigation, Gracie didn’t blink she threatened war. When the BBC responded by sending a senior executive to her house to negotiate, she hid the washing up and the dog’s toys, shooed her teenage son upstairs and turned her garden sprinkler on to hide the unmown grass. “Imagine the home of a single parent locked in a long battle with her employer and suffering depression as a result,” she writes. “That’s what my house looked like.” It didn’t matter. The BBC had agreed to pay parity, and to backdate the consequent increase. She had won.Victory, though, is rarely the final moment. Particularly when you have a powerful collective – known as BBC Women – to fight injustice alongside you, and when your objective is not to destroy an organisation, but to make it confront inequality and reform. And particularly when you were shocked to find yourself in a fight at all.“I just thought we’d sort it out,” Gracie tells me of the period in July 2017 when, after the BBC was compelled by Royal Charter to publish details of salaries over £150,000, she discovered that she was being paid substantially less as China editor than the corporation’s US editor, Jon Sopel, or its man in the Middle East, Jeremy Bowen. “We’d have a conversation, we’d sort it out – because I’d asked for equal pay before I went to China, for one thing, and I was just like, ‘Well what on earth’s happened here? This is all a bit weird.’ So in the beginning, I guess I thought it was the anomaly that they kept claiming it was.” The words “oversight” and “anomaly”, she drily notes, are much beloved by those who pay women less than they’re entitled to and then get found out.As it turned out, there seemed to be no intention of “sorting it out” rather, Gracie embarked on a protracted series of confrontations in which her sense of self-esteem and her faith in professionalism and ethical behaviour were shaken. Throughout, she was sustained by the solidarity of female colleagues, although she remains adamant that this is a universal problem: “Whenever anyone makes it a woman’s issue, it annoys me. It’s a human issue. And do they believe in equality? Do they believe in justice?”Gracie had not been dissatisfied with her annual pay of £134,000 and she is well aware of her own privilege as an Oxford graduate, a longtime journalist and a white, middle-class woman. (Nor was she shy of talking about pay back in 2009, at the height of the MPs’ expenses scandal, she had responded to a demand from Lord Foulkes, irritated at being questioned by her, to reveal her salary: £92,000, she replied, immediately and unapologetically. In the hoopla after the programme, it was reported that McCoy, her co-host, was earning £190,000, although the BBC denied it.) But now she was angry that the post she had been all but begged by James Harding, then director of news, to take three-and-a-half years earlier was being remunerated at up to half the rate – high salaries were published in bands – than those performing a clearly comparable role. Harding had invoked her experience and expertise – now 57, she had joined the World Service in 1987, covered the death of Deng Xiaoping, the handover of Hong Kong and the Beijing Olympics, and speaks fluent Mandarin – and the urgency of covering China’s rise as a superpower to persuade her she would not simply be good in the role, she was arguably the only person who could do it to the required standard.Gracie’s hesitation was not due to a lack of interest, but a consideration of the impact of a long-distance, high-profile job on her teenage children, one of whom had endured childhood leukaemia and both of whom had watched their mother survive breast cancer. There were also the challenges of reporting from a heavily censored, one-party state. But when she accepted the role, urged by friends and family, she demanded equal pay, having long suspected that she was paid less than male colleagues. Until July 2017, she believed she had secured it.She is at pains to point out that it wasn’t about the money and, indeed, when she reached a financial settlement with the BBC, she donated the full amount of £361,000 to the Equal Pay Advice Service and the Fawcett Society.“If I’d been more motivated by money than I was by advancing gender equality,” she explains now, “then I might have pursued a different course. But I wasn’t, because I am very deeply – what would be the verb? – immersed in BBC values.”Among those values, one might conclude, are fairness, impartiality and a respect for facts. But Gracie’s attempts to correct the “oversight” suggest otherwise. “I definitely think it’s easy to make the mistake of pointing out a problem and think that by articulating the problem clearly and forcefully you are thereby solving the problem,” she says. “I learned the hard way that that’s not how it works you know, reasoning with people who are powerful, wealthy, have status, reason with them and you can make the best argument in the world. It can be evidence-based until the cows don’t come home and you’re still not going to win.”One of the reasons is that pay, as well as being an emotive and often obscured part of our lives, is also, as Gracie points out, like the game Jenga – once you start to mess with one brick, the whole edifice starts to wobble. That’s why, she argues, employers in cases like these attempt to “keep it isolated in one woman’s silo and then preferably she will sign some kind of confidentiality clause about it, about the back pay or whatever they’re going to give her to make it right, then often it does stay quiet and it gets resolved”.Less chance of that, of course, when the organisation is a highly scrutinised and publicly funded national institution one in which the subjects themselves are adept at gathering and disseminating news. At the beginning of 2018, getting nowhere with the BBC, after having taken advice from such BBC luminaries as Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Mishal Husain, Gracie threw a gigantic stone into the millpond by using the letters page of the Times to reveal the details of her case on the front page, the newspaper reported that more than 130 other women working at the BBC had endorsed her case. That same morning, Gracie headed into Broadcasting House to present the Today programme – in one of the situation’s many grim ironies, she had been given some holiday cover in response to widespread complaints that the programme didn’t have enough female presenters. Her co-presenter was John Humphrys who, she writes in Equal, arrived at 4am, told her that her letter was either idiocy or a stroke of genius, and “then did some harrumphing that it would be uncollegiate of me to repeat”.During our conversation, I press her to do precisely that – in particular concerning the far-from-supportive conversation that Humphrys was recorded having with Jon Sopel, both of them presuming themselves to be off air. (It is a matter of continuing amazement that veteran broadcasters seem to have such trouble remembering the cast-iron rule that you are never alone with a microphone.) What did she feel? What did the programme’s editor, Sarah Sands, delayed by travel arrangements that morning, say to her when they finally caught up?She is admirably, if frustratingly, guarded she replies that she has said everything she wants to say about her colleagues in Equal, and doesn’t want to speak off the cuff. (Even in the book she’s tactful, saying that she felt the pair had let her, the BBC and its audiences down.) Of Sands, she says now: “I mean private conversations are private conversations, so I said what I said. I actually think Sarah just laughed but I can’t remember, to be honest.” Where Gracie is prepared to be forthcoming is on the toll that such a gruelling and prolonged experience takes. She stopped sleeping properly and became depressed eventually, her doctor signed her off work. “I was mentally unwell,” she says now. “And that’s not uncommon. These fights take a huge amount out of people.”What was her primary sensation? “Helplessness. I don’t like feeling helpless. And when I feel helpless, I feel really helpless, it’s physically, emotionally immobilising. I have to lie down, you know? I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to operate.”This comes from a woman who has faced more than her fair share of harrowing loss and trauma. Her mother died of ovarian cancer at 42, when Gracie, the second of five children, was 17. It was, she agrees, an existential crisis.“I think my mother had provided my map of the world and without her it was hard to see why to get up in the morning or what you would do if you did get up in the morning. It was hard to have any sense of purpose about life at all.” It also gave her, she thinks, a sense of impatience, a conviction that waiting around for things to happen is a fool’s errand.That profound understanding that life is precarious and unpredictable can only have been reinforced by her daughter Rachel’s diagnosis with leukaemia when she was two years old. Gracie’s marriage, to Chinese musician Cheng Jin, foundered under the strain, and although he has stepped into the breach at various points, Gracie has for long periods been their children’s principal carer. She inherited the BRCA1 gene from her mother, which put her at risk of both breast and ovarian cancer in her 40s, she had breast cancer twice and went through chemotherapy and mastectomies.Gracie’s mother died, she says, because despite their best efforts, the medical profession had not found a way to cure her she and her daughter survived because they had. In her battle with her employer, she says she felt they were “finding clever ways to avoid solving the problems… that’s not acceptable to me. Life is short. We’re not going to do this.”Equal comes out at the beginning of this month, just a few months short of half a century after the 1970 Equal Pay Act. Carrie Gracie has returned to the BBC News Channel, where she worked before her appointment as China editor. BBC Women still exists Gracie describes them as “a large group of people who still believe in the things we believed in two years ago. We still fight a cause.”I ask her what she does when she’s not at work, writing a book and campaigning for equal pay. Uncustomary holidays in the Balearics aside, where’s the froth in her life? She hesitates before offering that she walks her dog and reads.“Yeah,” she says, ruefully. “Exciting life. What do I do? I don’t do anything that’s very frothy at the moment. I actually think my life needs more froth. Everyone needs froth and I think one of the downsides of writing a book about something as big and serious as this is that the froth has been marginalised in my life to an unacceptable degree.”I wonder if I’ve struck a chord, because, a little later, she says: “I might just kind of have more fun. I don’t have any debts to anyone else any more. I have a debt to myself.”Three-and-a-half years earlier James Harding, the then director of news, had begged me to become the BBC’s first China editor, saying we urgently needed to tell the story of a rising superpower and I was the only person who could do the story justice. The BBC had said the role was “on a par with” the other international editors. I’d explicitly made equal pay with my male peers a condition of taking the job. Four years on, my salary was £134,000 but this pay list said the North America editor was earning between £200,000 and £250,000.Equal pay might sound like an unusual deal-breaker, but it made perfect sense to me. Like many women at the BBC, I had long suspected I was earning less than the men I worked alongside. But in an environment where pay was opaque and talking about it taboo, it seemed preferable to talk about the journalism.I’d never asked my peers directly what they were earning and never issued an ultimatum on pay. I liked my male colleagues. It seemed invidious to challenge managers in a way that might impact the pay of people I liked.When I went through treatment for breast cancer, my bosses were kind to me. I reasoned that, in many ways, the BBC was a good employer. In return, I had always tried to be a good employee. Every year I persuaded my ex-husband Jin to come back from Beijing and stand in at home for a few weeks so that I could do one big reporting trip to China, and I never demanded higher pay for all the prep and post-production. The BBC showed me goodwill and I showed it goodwill back. One of my documentary projects followed the transformation of China through the experiences of three families in a village that was being razed to make way for a city. This White Horse Village series won the BBC a Peabody Award and an Emmy. At the moment the Emmy was announced in New York, I was, quite literally, washing up at my kitchen sink.My children, Rachel and Daniel, were 12 and 10 at the time, and as I dried my hands and sat down to help with homework I joked that I was a real-life Cinderella. But not being invited to the ball was a commonplace at the BBC. We had lots of people who did brilliant work for little recognition.In a letter to the director-general, Tony Hall, I wrote that unless I was made equal I would resign: “I am a cancer survivor in my mid-50s who lost my own mother to cancer when I was a teenager and who nursed my own daughter through childhood leukaemia. I did not apply for the China editor post, and was reluctant to take it, precisely because of the strains I knew it would impose on my family and my health. I agreed to do the job because I cared about our coverage of China and because I thought the BBC needed older women journalists to ‘lean in’. I am bitterly disappointed to discover that my contribution as an editor is valued at so much less than my male peers.’ I warned the director-general that unless I was made equal I would resign.I then worked backwards through the past 20 years of my career, asking male peers direct questions about pay. I chose not to tackle this face to face or on the phone, but to put questions in writing instead, as I felt this would allow me to be polite and clear and would allow them time to consider. My email explained that I realised they were under no obligation to disclose their salaries and might prefer not to, but that the recent revelations compelled me to ask in an attempt to make sense of my own pay story.The responses were mixed. Some men, like the Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen and the world affairs editor John Simpson, were generous with information. Others were less so. Asking became easier the more often I did it, and in the end I wished I had started years ago as it came to feel natural and collegiate, just something that all grown-ups should do. I felt grateful to those who shared. Theirs was a real-world demonstration of empathy, one of the simplest but most powerful things a man can do to help a woman achieve equal pay.Equal, by Carrie Gracie, is published by Little, Brown on 5 September (£18.99).

It can help to write these reasons down somewhere you can access them easily, to remind yourself when you feel your resolve wavering.”Once you’ve established your reasoning, Warrington says that you should continue to attend social functions, seeing them as “sober firsts”. “Weddings can be extra challenging, as these are some of our booziest get-togethers,” she says. “Go into these and any other ‘sober firsts’ with an open mind, and stay curious about what the experience will be like sober. If you’re used to drinking, staying sober can even be a different kind of altered state – with all the surprises, the highs and the lows.”With the alcohol-free market expanding, and some estimates anticipating it to grow by a third in the next three years, there are plenty of options available to replace your usual tipple of choice at a social function. Warrington recommends a tonic with bitters as being “more grown up than ordering a Coke”, while a record £57m was spent on non-alcoholic beers in Britain over the past year.Kate Bee, the founder of Sober School – a sobriety training course for women – emphasises the need to be confident about your decision. “Really own it and never apologise for not drinking,” she says. “Instead, smile brightly and say: ‘I’m not drinking at the moment and I can’t believe how much I’m enjoying it.’ Even if you have to fake that enthusiasm it’s worth it. It’s much harder for people to pressure you to drink if you’re happy being alcohol-free.”When undergoing such a potentially life-altering change, it is important to discuss what you are doing with friends and gain their support, according to Warrington. “Let your friends know about your journey as that can be one of the most powerful means of encouragement,” she says. “And when they see you’re capable of it, they might decide to try it for themselves, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0347c9d6fb6c4ead4490effcca857d41171ffe0/0_116_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4280de887065fae9557bd995701e84d","title":"a friend lent me a mortgage deposit how much do i owe him now","story":"He gave me £10,000 towards the £250,000 property in 2006, but it’s now worth £450,000Q In 2006 I bought a house for £250,000 with an interest-only mortgage.

This in turn would “make government housing delivery targets impossible to achieve and slow new building across the sector”, he said.Against a backdrop of falling owner occupation in Britain as first-time buyers find it difficult to get on the housing ladder, the government has promised to deliver 300,000 homes a year by the mid 2020s.Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said 2020 would be a delicate year for the housing market. “Even if Brexit can be resolved relatively smoothly, the travails of the global economy will impact growth in the UK, making prospects for house prices relatively subdued,” she said.• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/415e2c2dc566c46a9742afec996d7129cd4e5e89/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cc13090018ea2678452f3c3add8a14f","title":"50 great tracks for september from normani tinariwen miley cyrus and more","story":"Former Fifth Harmony member Normani’s solo career properly lifts off, while country supergroup the Highwomen and rapper Megan Thee Stallion offer distinct, spirited defences of womanhood’s complexityby  Ammar Kalia and  Laura SnapesThe former Fifth Harmony member’s best single to date bears clear evidence of co-writer Ariana Grande’s influence. Normani breezes through the verses as if skipping down a crystalline staircase, just as Grande usually does. But Normani also has inimitable charisma, evincing her supreme confidence that she’s absolutely the only one who can please her man by taking a light touch to the delivery no sledgehammer required. It’s brassy and excellently sloganeering – “let me be your motivation … let me be your inspiration” – and has a proper dancing-in-the-rain, flirting-on-the-basketball-court smash of a video to match. LSAustralian pop-star-in-waiting Cxloe has written the anthem for an era in which fans express their love by asking their favourite stars to step their necks or run them over with a truck. Sick isn’t about pining politely: “I need you to make me sick  Love me out my mind,” she pleads, channelling some of Lorde’s dangerous intimacy, all tapered, gasping vocal delivery writhing through producer Gnash’s beats. Probably not what the doctor ordered, but when life is tempered through screens and a generation of young rappers and pop stars ooze numbed pain, her demand for a visceral, mind-overhauling kind of obsession sounds quite appealing. LSLike bonfires and birthday candles, Kim Gordon’s voice has a particular char that has become more distinctive with age. Now 66, she is releasing her first solo album, No Home Record, and the lead single places her signature ashy tone front and centre. She declaims menacingly and obliquely – “aliveness is an objection, affected me” – as a bass clarinet shudders like the surface of dark water, and percussive blasts detonate at random. It’s an unnerving landscape that becomes strangely moving when a pocket of reflection opens up, Gordon musing about a day “in the sunlight, dreaming in a tent”. The sound of forlorn acoustic guitar appears, seeming to mock her bucolic reverie. LSTuareg rockers Tinariwen have always made music that reflects the desert setting of its creation: loose, sparsely populated and full of stark contrasts. For their ninth album, the group rehearsed in the Moroccan Sahara en route to recording in Mauritania. You can almost hear a sand-laden breeze waft through the background on Kel Tinawen as singer Ibrahim Ag Alhabib employs his gravelly baritone as a counterpoint to indie star Cass McCombs’s gly guitars, a chorus of backing vocals keeping the mid-tempo groove undulating. It is imaginative music, a song to place the listener squarely within Tinariwen’s universe, regardless of where you are listening. AKNot a tribute to Definitely Maybe on its 25th anniversary – though admirably brazen in title – Slide Away is Miley Cyrus’s eulogy for her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth. And it’s beautiful. Her dramatic vocal turn in the verses traces the scale of what they had – paradise, paralysing – only to shrink again, conveying the sense of necessary retreat in her lovely, limpid chorus: “So won’t you slide away?  Back to the ocean, I’ll go back to the city lights.” Like Ariana Grande’s Thank U, Next, it’s a dignified, adult breakup song – not score-settling, but honouring what was before moving on. LSPelada are Montreal electronic duo Chris Vargas and Tobias Rochman. Set to release their debut album on Pan this autumn, they came up through the city’s rave scene (the one that birthed Grimes a decade ago), distinguishing themselves by pairing Rochman’s hardware-focused production with unusual live vocals by Vargas, who rails in Spanish against power, surveillance and politics. While Vargas has cited the influence of their childhood exposure to cumbia on Pelada’s sound, Ajetreo (hustle and bustle) hews closer to the hectic, compressed kuduro sound that travelled from Angola to Lisbon’s electronic scene: Rochman gives the beat a junkyard patina that offers a playful contrast with his slippery pitch-shifting. LSSince winning the Mobo for best jazz act in 2015 with drummer Moses Boyd, saxophonist Binker Golding has become one of the key sidemen in the renascent London jazz scene, blowing coruscating sheets of free improvisation with Boyd, tasteful balladry with singer Zara McFarlane and challenging bebop with pianist Elliot Galvin. With his first quartet album as bandleader out in September, single ... And I Like Your Feathers is a subtly intricate number featuring a breezy interplay between Golding and bassist Daniel Casimir. It’s straight-ahead jazz but loses none of its potency for it Golding shows that his playing isn’t to be relegated to a dinner party background. AKA quick catch-up, for anyone not primed in the hot girl summer meme: Houston rapper Megan Thee Stallion has various aliases, including the Hot Girl. A few months back, a fan declared this a “hot girl summer”, and a meme was born, mostly revolving around Instagram posts of people showing off their hot bods. Obviously, brands from makeup companies to fast food chains leapt on it, almost killing it stone dead. But on the brink of summer’s burnout, Megan revived it with a titular anthem. It’s surprisingly laid back, but then, what is the essence of hot girl summer if not having nothing to prove? Getting Nicki Minaj (with her best verse in months) and Ty Dolla $ign (who arguably dominates too much) is bragging rights enough. Though Megan – her voice brilliantly thick with cynicism – packs in a few for good measure. “Got a whole lot of options ’cause you know a bitch poppin’.” LSLana Del Rey’s frame of reference is well established: Americana, essentially, as her new album’s brilliant title, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, makes plain. But now and then, another (probably accidental) reference rears up in her music: the ironclad, turn-of-the-millennium songwriting of Robbie Williams collaborator Guy Chambers. It’s there in the classic piano arrangement of The Greatest, a song about precisely the opposite of such triumphalism: the end of a relationship, the climate crisis, how “Kanye West is blond and gone”. If this is the end, at least Del Rey gives it a gorgeous coda. LSThe Highwomen are country supergroup Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires, Maren Morris and Natalie Hemby their mission closing the still staggering gender gap in country music. For their theme song, they involved Jimmy Webb in a rewrite of his 1975 hit that became the founding text for country supergroup the Highwaymen (comprising Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson) in 1985. But with a difference: the quartet don’t paint themselves as heroic outlaws, but revamp the original to reference the fates that befell women who dared to step outside society’s bounds. The group’s debut album will feature various guests: here, Bristol soul singer Yola and Sheryl Crow add to the quartet’s stirring vocal harmonies.

Without bland corporate sponsorship or dehumanising big screens flanking its main stages, it is defined by its oddball community, a circus of hedonists, eccentrics and beleaguered parents whose buggies clog paths as toddlers gawp at the peacocks. Hidden sculptures and carved tree trunks give the small site an otherworldly forcefield the stranger who held forth on avant-garde mixology around the campfire will unfailingly reappear one morning, perhaps during your recuperative stroll around the beekeeping enclosure. It is, for all its twee nooks and middle-class crannies, a winning mix of bacchanalia and earthy mysticism.Therein lies the EOTR magic, but nobody told Yves Tumor, who prowls the fogged-out Big Top on Friday in a silk stole and thigh-high boots. “I drove down way too many little-ass roads,” Tumor hisses theatrically, turning the sound monitors towards the crowd, “for this shit not to be loud enough.” A primal squall erupts – crashing R\u0026ampB blown out by industrial beats. After 45 captivating minutes – partly spent thrashing about in the front row – Tumor announces: “Whoever stole my scarf, you better hide that shit because I’m gonna kill you.” They swan off-stage, scooping up the hastily returned scarf along the way.The headliners hew more closely to the fest’s understated roots. Jason Pierce mostly performs from the side of the stage, as if Spiritualized’s rock hymns had drained his bones and left behind an empty vessel. Courtney Barnett honours her punk raconteur background, helming a grungy trio that electrifies her hyper-observant yarns. And nomy’s disco lights and falsetto singalongs illuminate a suitably verdant Woods stage.Those seeking grandiosity get their neo-soul fill from Michael Kiwanuka, but a detour to a Late Junction-curated stage ups the ante, with technomancer BodyVice and her gagged dancer pogoing around a giant prop of a human spine. Esoterica abounds: cellist Oliver Coates looks like a nervous Edwardian choirboy but, performing in front of a cloaked statue apparently representing death, his modern classical works marvels. Bridging the arty and incendiary is Mitski. She performs conceptual dance around a simple table while belting out anthems for twentysomethings that could start riots. From her poise emerges a latent fury: during Geyser she topples her desk prop, then freezes with longing and violently grapples with the table’s legs.Sunday corrals rising rockers Fontaines DC, surprise guests Shame and the doomier Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs, all young men of great intensity, though none has the flair of on-form Deerhunter, Bradford Cox vamping through cult classics from across the Atlanta band’s career. Squid’s playful abandon is a tonic to their brawnier contemporaries, while Serpentwithfeet’s wispy melisma and baroque R\u0026ampB exude a more spiritual intensity.Night descends and Jarvis Cocker, ever the picture of shaggy charisma, tumbles on stage in a stuffy blazer, waggling his arms like a bad magician or an excellent supply teacher. He sashays through anthems old and new, then warns of our return to reality. “But that’s tomorrow,” he says, introducing his 2009 album’s title track: “And we shouldn’t get bogged down in … Further Complications.”The portal between real life and the dreamland is Lonnie Holley, who conjures atomised jazz alongside a programmer who lays their synths on a Twister mat. The Alabama artist reprehends the tyranny of time, ego and America in a weathered growl, dreaming up poetry on topics such as the Amazon rainforest fire. “We’ll see you in the twilight zone, humans,” Holley concludes. Among End of the Road’s dreamy congregation, it’s as if we’ve already made it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf5d2aec2f80f1304a6f9e8a4a8e6ec158a76f0/0_1380_7300_4380/master/7300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c1940d8487468b10fe47b829d261a3a","title":"the man who gave birth podcast","story":"Freddy McConnell is a  journalist and trans man who in 2016 decided to begin the process of conceiving and delivering his own child.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Theresa May had planned to end free movement through the immigration bill, but the proposed legislation, along with several other key new laws, have not made it through parliament because the Brexit crisis has choked the legislative process.Patel thought she could get around this using a so-called “Henry VIII power” but experts including Alexandra Sinclair, a fellow at the Public Law Project, cited by House of Commons library researchers in a report on the issue that any such move “might run into difficulties”.The Institute for Government’s programme director for Brexit, Joe Owen, said it would be “wide open to judicial review”.“On a practical level the plan is so close to impossible – if not entirely impossible – that one wonders whether the government is serious about making it work.”The shift in policy did not involve any assessment of how employers, landlords or Border Force officials would be able to distinguish between EU citizens already legally resident in the UK and those coming to the UK for the first time after a no-deal exit from the EU.In a statement which did not address points made by legal experts that free movement did not automatically end on 31 October, the Home Office said: “Freedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they came from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05dea2b553adc58b4d41dbb0e644d9e0e17fbae8/0_190_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e90280a5e7b41dd5d6ee55cbf5873893","title":"passports pets gb stickers brexit advice issued britons","story":"The Get Ready website uses multiple choice questions to offer tailored informationRenew your passport earlier than planned, buy a GB sticker for your car, and prepare to wait four months before you can take your ferret on holiday: these are all among the snippets of advice offered by the government’s new Brexit website for British citizens planning to travel to the EU after 31 October.The Get Ready site, which is accompanied by a major advertising campaign, launched on Sunday and unequivocally states that Brexit will happen by the end of next month. It asks users a series of multiple choice questions and spells out the precautions that iniduals should take immediately to make sure they are prepared for the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal.British citizens resident in the UK who have become used to easily travelling across Europe are warned to ensure that their passport has at least six months to run and told they may once again have to pay roaming charges on their mobile phones.They are also recommended to allow extra time for border checks at ports and airports and told to make sure they have travel insurance as the European health insurance card – which covers the cost of state-provided healthcare in EU countries – will not be valid in the event of a no-deal exit.People taking their UK-registered vehicles abroad will have to carry additional paperwork proving their ownership of the vehicle and potentially obtain an international driving permit, while British drivers will face a fine if they do not stick a large GB sticker on their rear bumper, even if they already have the country listed on their numberplate.Pet passports, which have made it easy for people who regularly travel abroad to take their cat, dog or ferret overseas, could become invalid in the event of no deal, with owners warned it could take up to four months to get the appropriate paperwork and blood tests from vets.Although the Get Ready site largely collates existing government advice, the list of suggestions spells out in exacting detail the impact Brexit will have on people and businesses. EU citizens living in the UK are reminded to apply to the settlement scheme “as soon as possible” if they want to remain in the country, while European students are warned that their Erasmus+ placements at British universities may no longer be valid.The advice is not detailed and does not spell out the seriousness of the consequences for Britons settled in Europe in the event of no deal. Under EU law they will become third-country nationals and will not be able to offer services to another EU country automatically or to travel for work in another EU country.The campaign group British in Europe has frequently protested that the British government has forgotten about them. The new website merely advises that “you may not be able to continue living and using services in the EU if you are not a resident”, without spelling out the gravity of the end of free movement for Britons living in the EU.The more complicated warnings are saved for businesses, although the website does not offer a hierarchy of risks. British companies are warned that they may need to pay for extra legal advice, should consider whether they need to appoint agents and representatives based in Europe, and warned of the extra regulation required if they want to continue trading in the EU after Brexit.The site warns manufacturers that they may need to change their labelling, companies that handle the data of EU citizens are told they may no longer be able to access it in the same way, and almost all companies are warned starkly: “You may not be able to trade goods with the EU if you do not get your business ready.”Most of the recommended actions are listed with a warning to “do it as soon as possible”, but with fewer than 60 days to go until the planned Brexit day, small businesses checking the website for the first time may not have time to do all the required work.However, the site shows that not everyone is affected by Brexit. British nationals who live and work in the UK, do not run a business and have no plans to travel abroad are told to sit back and relax: “Based on your responses, you do not need to take any action to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 October 2019.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c5813c1a4b02cf988a334d073d74e9c3be23a4/0_0_5619_3370/master/5619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bcf69e619855caf0d4cecf29b869cfb","title":"irish border after brexit all ideas beset by issues","story":"Exclusive: leaked report says at present there is no deliverable alternative to the backstopAll potential solutions to the post-Brexit Irish border are fraught with difficulty and would leave smaller businesses struggling to cope, experts have said, as leaked government papers outline major concerns just two months before Britain is due to leave the EU.A report summarising the findings of the government’s official “alternative arrangements” working groups concluded that there are issues with all the scenarios put forward to try to replace the backstop arrangement. There are also specific concerns over whether any technological solution could be delivered to monitor cross-border trade.Critics said the paper, seen by the , should “ring alarm bells” across government over how likely it is that alternative arrangements to the backstop will be found.The dossier marked “official-sensitive” prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board is dated 28 August. It details how the findings of all advisory groups informing the government on the Northern Irish border are being kept deliberately under wraps to try to avoid hampering Britain’s intended renegotiation of the backstop agreed to by Theresa May.Alternative systems to avoid a hard Northern Irish border after Brexit have become the central tenet of Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy. He sees this as a way of unlocking a new deal with Europe and has claimed that there are “abundant solutions”.However, the damning report shows there is no single deliverable solution at present, despite the fact Johnson is almost a third of the way through the “30 days” target that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave him to come up with a fresh border proposal.The report said: “It is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.”Johnson’s claim that a hard border could be avoided with mobile checks of livestock and crops was dismissed by experts as the most unlikely option to work. The report said: “Overall there were a number of concerns surrounding the deliverability of technological facilitations.”Questions were also raised over whether a trusted trader scheme – the current favourite for a border solution – would require infrastructure to set it up.MP Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: “As we continue to get closer to 31 October, with Boris Johnson attempting to shut down our democracy, this leaked document rings alarm bells. It proves the government has no deliverable solution to the Irish border, let alone being able to find one within the next few weeks.“The fact that in this document there is not a single option that can be put forward to the EU as a viable alternative to the backstop, and that No 10 do not want to release these findings as they know Boris Johnson’s bluff will be revealed, simply shows why MPs must come together to stop no deal.”Naomi Smith, the chief executive of the Best for Britain group, which is “committed to finding a democratic way to stop Brexit”, said: “It is utterly shameful that the government has found no practical solution to the question of the Irish border, despite its insistence that the backstop be removed.“Removing the backstop without something to take its place would fundamentally undermine the Good Friday agreement, and the fragile peace process started just 20 years ago which it guards.“Despite the prime minister shutting down parliament, MPs must do all they can to block a damaging and undemocratic no-deal Brexit, and the reimposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland.”The official report summarises the work of two groups tasked with coming up with border ideas: advisory groups involving agricultural and food experts, customs and legal specialists and senior Northern Irish figures and a Whitehall-based group which is due to shortly come up with a negotiating position on how to rework the withdrawal agreement to present to the EU.Border solutions the report deems as having the most potential are listed as:There were significant concerns about an artificial intelligence option, which experts felt might not detect disease and chemical contamination of food.Onboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods was also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.Physical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to “targeting” and staff could be at risk, it said.Significantly, smaller businesses in Northern Ireland could suffer through the additional administration required to send and receive goods across the border, as well as other constraints and costs, the report found. They might also struggle with data collection or be unwilling to share information due to concerns around privacy.“This is because they do not have the existing systems in place and are more likely to have non-standardised products and product ranges,” it said.“However, we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement …”A spokesperson for the DExEU said: “We don’t comment on leaked documents.”Over the weekend, the Republic of Ireland’s minister for foreign affairs, Simon Coveney, said his country would not agree to drop the backstop merely for the “political convenience” of the British prime minister.In a forthright interview with the Sunday Business Post newspaper, he said: “There isn’t a single EU member state putting pressure on Ireland to move away from that position, despite the fact that the UK has spoken to all of them and used all of the persuasion that they can muster to actually move countries away from that position.”He said dropping the backstop would only create problems for Ireland further down the line. “I’m not going to pretend to people that we can do that for political convenience now to get a deal, and then find that Irish politics is dominated by the border issue indefinitely into the future. We’re not doing that,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb1d3308dbee42180fd841b3ffbc7b4aa952a420/0_10_698_419/master/698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9efc098f294a2317b1fd4c60b46a1d","title":"a typical hour in the life of the irish border","story":"The map above shows border crossings in real time over the busiest hour of an ordinary Monday, 26 August 2019. The currently invisible frontier is not an arcane footnote of the Brexit process but an everyday part of people\u0027s lives and livelihoodsThere are 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra). There are also eight trains daily in either direction between Dublin and Belfast. A no-deal Brexit would effectively end this trade. UK government advice says that to transport animals, products of animal origin (POAO), fish, shellfish, crustaceans, germplasm or fishery products from the UK to the EU in the event of no deal, you’ll need to ensure the trade route for your goods allows for your consignment to be checked at a border inspection post (BIP) at the first EU country you enter for export.There are two BIPs in Ireland: one at Dublin port, and the other at Shannon airport in the middle of the island. This means that farmers in Fermanagh who wanted to sell livestock at the market in nearby Sligo would have to send their animals to Belfast, across the sea to Scotland, by road through England to Holyhead in Wales, back across the sea, to Dublin, and right across Ireland.The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has always insisted its priority is for Northern Ireland not to be cut off from Great Britain, politically or economically. Northern Ireland\u0027s export trade with GB in 2017 was worth £11.3bn, nearly three times the £3.9bn it exported to Ireland.But it\u0027s worth considering who the losers would be in the event of a no-deal Brexit and the sudden return of border controls. They are not, typically, employees of large companies who work in Belfast and deal with the rest of the United Kingdom. They are, rather, people working for small businesses in counties Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone, especially those in the agricultural sector.It stands to reason that border areas will be worst affected, but even given that, the blow will fall hardest on western rather than southern border areas. With some exceptions, these are more Irish-nationalist areas overall, and least likely to vote for the DUP.• Main graphic source: Transport Infrastructure Ireland.

Tests proved that plants in which the gene is more prominently expressed are better able to survive drought.The scientists believes this finding will have important implications for the cereal industry as it faces increasing challenges from climate crisis-related drought.Peter Morris from Heriot-Watt University led the research team. “By increasing the expression of this particular gene in test plants and simulating drought conditions, we’ve been able to prove that plants in which HvMYB1 is more prominently expressed are able to survive prolonged periods of drought,” he said. “This is a significant finding that will allow more drought-resistant crops to be bred in the future.“Drought is already impacting yields, with the European cereal harvest hit particularly hard in 2018.

If you haven’t seen it yet, you can do so here and I strongly recommend giving it a look.A powerfully built four-year-old, Ghaiyyath eased to the front with a little under a circuit to race and soon had his rivals on the rack. They were toiling behind him at the home turn and, impressively, he pulled further clear in the straight, scoring by an official 14 lengths, though apparently it would have been given as 12 or 13 in Britain.Ghaiyyath is trained in Newmarket by Charlie Appleby but, if you’d lost track of him, it’s probably because he hasn’t raced in this country since 2017, when he won the Autumn Stakes half an hour before U S Navy Flag (remember him?) won the Dewhurst. Ghaiyyath was supposed to be a Derby contender then but didn’t run again until the following September.He’s been sidelined again this year, from late April until Sunday, so we’re not looking at a robust sort here. But the third horse in the Grosser Preis was the German Derby winner, previously unbeaten this year, so Ghaiyyath appears to be a huge talent. His Racing Post Rating for this run is 128, a higher figure than Enable has managed since her first Arc in 2017.Making all the running would be a lot harder in the Arc but Ghaiyyath is a strong traveller rather than a tearaway and he doesn’t have to go from the front if there’s a strong pace on. He’s down to 12-1 for the Longchamp race from Sunday morning’s 33-1.The Post has described him as “a stonking bet” at the 16-1 that was available on Sunday night but there are things to worry about if you feel like chasing the price down. In view of his history, he’s no certainty to be as fit for Paris as he was here and he might be best fresh. And he has to give a 3lb sex allowance to Enable. Have I mentioned that before?It looks like Oisin Murphy is in for another productive day at Chepstow on his way to his first champion jockey’s title but I’m fielding against him in the third race, in which there might be some value in the 14-1 about J’Ouvert (2.45). Making her first start for David Evans and her handicap debut as well, this three-year-old filly showed some ability on her second start when second to a Godolphin winner at Chelmsford in February.She’s been with Evans for a couple of months and, while his yard is not in brilliant form, she could be dangerous off a rating of 64 with a capable 7lb claimer aboard. She has six winning siblings and faces five rivals who are relatively exposed. Having been allowed to drift to 20-1, she has been the subject of some support. Obviously I’d like to see more in the last hour before the race.Earlier, Allez Sophia (2.15) is fairly priced at 9-4 for a novice race in which she represents the in-form Eve Johnson Houghton.The nap is Chil Chil (4.25) in the opening race of Windsor’s twilight meeting. She scooted up on her handicap debut five days ago, having had a wind operation, and looks well in under a penalty. The market sees this, of course, and she’s 5-6.At the other end of that card, I’m interested by Sir Michael Stoute’s Dubious Affair (7.30). She was eight lengths clear of the third when runner-up on her handicap debut and gets to run from the same mark. I like her at 2-1 against Culture, who needs the cheekpieces to work for a second time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5a9b43774f24d87adb829ebd3798ddfd0a29e8c/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e84a027d31cb11eb6a154e5345f37917 1440w","title":"locals guide berne switzerland 10 top tips","story":"It is one of Europe’s smallest capitals but punches above its weight when it comes to world-class galleries, unbeatable urban swimming and, of course, chocolateTaking a dip in the river is a national pastime here, with the River Aare the basis of the city’s claim to be Europe’s urban swimming capital. Fed by meltwater from the Bernese Alps, the river has a magical blue colour, and it is perfectly clean to swim in, even in the city centre. The most popular spots are Marzilibad, an area with flat grassy lawns, easy access to the river and an open-air pool – and Lorrainebad, a little further downstream. The strength of the current means you need to plan where to get in and, more importantly, where you are going to get out (the exit points are all marked with red railings). Avoid the clearly marked weirs, where swimming is forbidden. There are paddleboards to hire at Tip-to-Tail. Information about the river’s temperature and the water’s flow rate is updated daily on my website, Aare Guru. Switzerland’s museums and art galleries are among the best in the world. The Renzo Piano-designed Paul Klee Zentrum on the outskirsts of Berne houses many of the finest works by the city’s most famous artist and also hosts international exhibitions. It’s a 10-minute bus ride from the city centre. The fine art museum, Kunstmuseum Bern, has a good permanent collection featuring Swiss artists such as 20th-century surrealist Méret Oppenheim and Ferdinand Hodler, whose realistic style became “parallelism”. The collection of giant crystals in the Natural History Museum really blew my mind as a child – I couldn’t believe that such delicate, beautiful things came out of the mountains.Right next to the main station is one of the city’s most unexpected places: the graffiti-covered Reitschule, or Reithalle. The former riding school was squatted in the 1980s and in spite of numerous attempts by the authorities to evict the squatters, they have turned the space into a vibrant alternative heart of the city and a welcoming space for everyone (you can stay as long as you like without purchasing food or drink). Inside are bars, a club, a theatre and a good restaurant, Sous le Pont , where you’re as likely to see businessmen in suits as anarchists. The Vorplatz area outside has pop-up bars and restaurants and on a Friday night is packed with young Bernese. That the Reitschule exists within 50 metres of the swankiest hotel in Berne (the five-star Hotel Schweizerhof) sums up the city for me: Berne packs a lot of variety into a small space.The recently refurbished Bristol hotel (doubles from about £202 B\u0026ampB – like the other places listed this includes a Bern Ticket, which gives guests access to all public transport in the city) offers smart, boutique-style rooms right in the old town. Hotel Jardin (doubles from about £150 B\u0026ampB) is a family-friendly three-star on the edge of the Lorraine district, a 20-minute walk from the centre. Bern Youth Hostel (dorm beds from about £33, en suite doubles from about £116) has recently refurbished rooms in a great location between the Marzili swimming area and the old town. The cheapest place to stay in the city is Eichholz campsite (open April-end September, adults about £10 plus about £8 for a small tent, dorm-style rooms also available) right on the banks of the Aare and an easy walk from the old town.Gelateria di Berna, which has four locations in the city (plus another in Zurich) and is a Bernese institution, creates unusual flavours like hibiscus flower, strawberry and balsamic vinegar, and there’s a chocolate sorbet to die for. A lovely and relaxed place for pastries, coffee and book browsing is Apfelgold. For the best Swiss chocolate, head to Läderach , which has stores on Marktgasse and in the central station. Every flavour of chocolate you could dream of is laid out in huge slabs on the counter, and sold by weight.For the best overview of Berne’s old town, climb up from the river to the Rosengarten (rose garden, free entry). It has a restaurant, and its benches are popular in the colder months as it catches the sun. The Botanical Garden (free entry) has a wonderful range of Alpine plants and is a lovely place to relax by the river. There are good swimming spots here, too. Alternatively, The Gurten is a 858-metre “mountain” (more of a hill, really) overlooking the city. As this is Switzerland, there is a funicular railway to take you to the top and a restaurant on the summit. There are also hiking, running and mountain biking trails on the forested slopes, as well as a 500-metre long summer toboggan run. Climbing the 100-metre spire of Berne’s cathedral is a must (open daily, adults about £4). I live very close by and it’s something I still do regularly. I never get tired of the view over the city: on a clear day you can see all the way to the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau mountains in the Bernese Alps. Nearby is the 13th-century Zytglogge (clock tower) – probably Berne’s most famous landmark. A guided tour lets you see the clock mechanism, which was crafted in the 16th century (departs 2.30pm daily or by appointment, adult about £17).The Bernese are famously leisurely walkers. The old town’s three miles of medieval shopping arcades, built from local sandstone, allow city folk to shop in comfort, protected from the elements. Try freshly baked bread and patisserie at Bäckerei Bohnenblust, and pop into Chat Noir for postcards, posters and craft products from local artists, which show that the Swiss design tradition is alive and well.The Altes Tramdepot serves some of the best beer in the city. The Bavarian-style beers are brewed on site next to the famous BärenPark (bear park). Unlike most places in Berne, the Tramdepot is open on Sundays. There are craft beers to try at BarBière , which is run by a group of friends who started off brewing in their garage before opening this bar in the hip Lorraine district. IPAs, stouts and porters are the focus here but there are also beers with ingredients like elderflower and cherries when in season. My favourite is a strongly hopped IPA – though the dark malty stouts are also delicious. Nearby Brasserie Lorraine serves unfussy dishes using local, seasonal ingredients (set lunch menu from £14). It has daily vegetarian and vegan options too. The Turnhalle is a cool cultural space in the city centre, popular for an after-work beer. It’s packed on Friday and Saturday evenings and is a popular hangout for the artists and designers who rent studios in the attached cultural centre, ProGR.Don’t believe those who tell you melted cheese is just for winter. The best fondue in Berne is served at Harmonie (mains from around £16), which does quality versions of other classic Swiss dishes too. A good place to sample modern takes on traditional Swiss food is Restaurant Lötschberg (mains from £16) in the old town.Best time to visit The warm summer and early autumn are the best times for river swimming (a few hardy types swim year round but you have to be OK with 6C water to join in). In winter, snow adds to the magical feel, and a visit can easily be added to a skiing holiday.Getting there Berne is one-hour by train from Basel and Zurich, and two hours from Geneva. Travel by rail from Paris (about 4½ hours), changing at Basel or Strasbourg, costs from £50.PricesBeer (half litre) around £5.50, cappuccino £4, three-course meal for two £85.Kaspar Allenbach is the designer of Berne’s urban swimming website, Aare GuruLooking for a holiday with a difference?

There are so many possible missteps, especially during a heightened “cancel” culture. But it is clear the actor and comedian – and now writer and producer – Aisling Bea has nailed it in This Way Up, when, in the very first scene, her character, Aine, on leaving an expensive inpatient mental health facility, makes a comment about the lack of snacks and Jacuzzi.The first time I was a private inpatient, I campaigned to switch the decaf coffee for proper coffee, and made a point about the tepid, dribbling showers – apparently a safety thing, which I still don’t understand, because who tries to self-harm with water pressure? “Just some feedback …” says Aine’s sister Shona (played by Sharon Horgan) to the receptionist. When an opening scene is as authentic as this, the tone and plot so perfectly, instantly established and recognisable – you know good things are to come.This Way Up focuses on Aine, an Irish woman living in London, who works as an English-as-a-foreign-language tutor, is very good at her job and clearly cares for her students. She is funny and engaging in the classroom, in contrast to the loneliness she feels in her personal life, as she gets back on her feet after what whispers refer to as a “breakdown”. It’s a show about recovery – hence the title – and everything that entails. Its original title was Happy AF.This Way Up has been a long time in the making. Bea mentioned it – as well as other projects with Horgan – to me a few years ago. It is written by Bea and executive-produced by the pair (and made by Merman, Horgan’s production company). Back then, Bea referred to Horgan as a sort of older sister. Given that, the onscreen chemistry between the two makes perfect sense.In Channel 4’s press release, she explains: “Sharon and I first played sisters in a TV show that got cancelled about eight years ago, and we have gone on many drunken nights out since to stay in character.”In This Way Up, Horgan displays the comic timing for which she is known, but we also get to see more of her straight acting. Shona struggles with the emotional labour of looking after – and constantly worrying about – a loved one who (it is heavily hinted) has attempted suicide, while being in her early 40s and facing the societal pressures of marriage and kids, which she is pretty sure she doesn’t want. Meanwhile, there’s a potential new sexual awakening outside her relationship and the difficulties of a workplace dominated by privately educated men.The sisterly bond between Aine and Shona is as good a creation as the one we saw in Fleabag. The touches of uproarious laughter (doing Hannibal Lecter impressions when wearing face masks) the frustrations (“Oh, eat my ass, Shona!” “Eat my ass!”) the things kept to oneself. It is a relationship with multiple hues and textures but bound together with a double helix. As for the subject of mental health, Bea wrote in the  in 2017 about her father, a “charismatic, handsome vet” who took his own life, and has talked about her own experiences of depression. She gets the random turmoil of it: the unwise sexual dalliances the awkward jokes the making your way back into the outside world, sometimes feeling that others are speaking an accented language that leaves you adrift. The feeling of being reduced to a child, because episodes of mental ill health can be infantilising.I almost caught my breath when Aine sinks to the floor of a bathroom, in the way that I have squatted under a shower with not enough energy to stand. But also, the coping mechanisms and shield of humour, sometimes combative, other times self-deprecating. In This Way Up, it is Aine referring to her inpatient stint as a “teeny little nervous breakdown”. In real life, it was a doctor enquiring what it was that had stopped me chucking myself in front of a bus and me replying that, as it drew closer, I saw the “sorry not in service” sign.This Way Up has a erse cast: not, as rightwing commentators would have it, because of political correctness, but because it is set in London. Aine’s boss is a black man, her flatmate is a black man her students are all immigrants (as, of course, are Aine and Shona). The two leads, as well as Charlotte, Shona’s colleague, are, in the parlance of criticism, “strong female characters”. Because that is real life. Charlotte is a brown, gay woman in a world of “rah” bankers.I haven’t even touched on the nuanced and complex relationship Aine has with her mother, played beautifully (if briefly) by Sorcha Cusack, who nails an emotionally fraught monologue when the two are left alone together. Or the back and forth of falling in love, or falling out of love the staring at ceilings in the night.While I was writing this, Bea left me a voicemail explaining she has been overwhelmed by the positive reaction to the show. It has been praised by the likes of Rob Delaney and gained many fans. It is now available in the US on Hulu.Bea has said that, before the show aired, she decided not to catastrophise about the reaction. “I actively decided for myself, for the first time in my life, to not allow myself to do that, and to maybe believe compliments and lean in,” she told the .I didn’t see much of Bea’s work on panel shows, but her regular stints gained her a legion of fans. Now, with This Way Up, she joins a crop of new television auteurs variously producing and writing, as well as acting in their creations: Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer’s Broad City Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag Charlie Covell’s The End of the F****ing World Natasha Lyonne’s Russian Doll and Mae Martin’s forthcoming Mae and George (working title).As Bea herself has put it (and worn on a T-shirt): “Female is not a genre.” None of these shows are the same or themed around gender it is just that, finally, women are getting a fair crack. As many of the above have noted, the only way they felt they could play the roles they wanted was to write them themselves.To be clear: This Way Up also had me doubled up with laughter, not just nodding along with the darker moments. I would also shout out the fact that, as with many of the most recent successful shows, it is concise: just six 24-minute episodes..It seems clear that a second series of This Way Up will follow, given the cliffhangers for Aine the other characters. And it seems … things are looking up? This way forward, then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e9047ee9c25d1d0105531e47a38b9315eca4c4b/0_777_2674_1605/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da7c79059919778326f7467917cc1bc","title":"statue red army general prague vandals czech capital","story":"Monument has become focus of a row between the Czech capital and its Russian embassyA statue of a second world war Red Army general repeatedly targeted by vandals has been covered with a tarpaulin amid an escalating row between Czech officials and Russia’s embassy in Prague over its status.Authorities in the Czech capital’s Bubeneč district put the imposing monument honouring Marshal Ivan Konev under cover after saying they were no longer prepared to keep cleaning it following repeated paint and graffiti attacks.The move – announced by the mayor of Prague 6 municipality, Ondřej Kolář – has further inflamed passions over the 40-year-old statue, long controversial in the Czech Republic because of Konev’s role as an enforcer of Soviet military power in postwar eastern Europe.Kolář, a member of the pro-EU Top 09 party, said he had been forced to leave Prague after being given police protection, which was put in place on Friday after he received threats by email, social media and text message.“People were calling my office, threatening even my assistants,” he said. “A few have also come personally to the town hall, asking the receptionists where I could be found so they can beat me up.”The Russian embassy denounced his decision on its Facebook page as a “repeated disgrace” and noted that it was “taken on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the start of the worst military conflict in human history”. Konev was twice officially recognised as a hero of the Soviet Union by Stalin.The tarpaulin, supported by a large scaffold frame, was torn off three times after being fitted on Friday. Two men were arrested and charged with damaging the cover after they were observed leaving the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning. Czech media attributed the damage to “activists”, widely believed to be pro-Russian.Temporary fencing has been installed to foil further attempts to rip off the cover. A council spokesman said it would remain at least until 12 September, when the statue’s future will be discussed at a council meeting.At the weekend, a worker re-covered the monument, located on Interbrigády Square – a neighbourhood that also hosts the Czech defence ministry and army headquarters – while opposing groups of activists gathered under the watch of two police officers.Petr Lázňovský, 48, a pro-democracy campaigner waving a large Nato flag, called the controversy an example of the “hybrid warfare” he said Russia was waging on the Czech Republic.“The crucial point for me is that the Russian embassy, in its Facebook post, claimed it had received letters from Czech citizens wondering which side in the second world war would the Prague 6 mayor have preferred to have won,” he said. “They are implying that Mayor Kolář is pro-Nazi. This is unacceptable for me.”The statue, which is owned by the Czech state, was commissioned during the cold war by the communist regime that then ruled the former Czechoslovakia, in recognition of Konev’s supposed feat in liberating Prague from Nazi occupation in 1945 – an assertion dismissed by historians, who argue the city was already free when his forces arrived.Kolář insisted he did not dispute that Soviet forces “had liberated a great part of Czechoslovakia” and added: “We are grateful to those men in arms who sacrificed their lives for our freedom.”Russia reacted angrily last year after the council amended the original plaque and added others citing Konev’s lesser-known role in more notorious episodes – namely the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the building of the Berlin Wall, and the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring.Last month, the statue was defaced with red paint as Czechs marked the invasion’s 51st anniversary, prompting Kolář to say the council would not repair the damage.The mayor has previously offered to give the statue to the embassy so it can be displayed on its grounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7f4108881072a928fefc416ec13d9cd44ff774b/135_126_2479_1487/master/2479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00e34566b4684ad8031cff5f41ba8a30","title":"berlin zoo celebrates rare birth of panda twins","story":"Meng Meng delivered two cubs, which must eventually be returned to ChinaBerlin zoo has said its resident panda Meng Meng has delivered twins, the first time one of the endangered animals has given birth in the country.“Meng Meng became a mom – twice!

They weighed 136g and 186g.On loan from China, Meng Meng and the male panda Jiao Qing arrived in Berlin in June 2017 to great fanfare.In what is known as “panda diplomacy”, China has dispatched its national treasure to about a dozen countries as a symbol of close relations.The zoo pays $15m in a 15-year contract to host them, with most of the money going towards a conservation and breeding research programme in China.The cubs born in Berlin must be returned to China within four years after they have been weaned.China has previously given three pandas to Germany but the last one, Bao Bao, died in Berlin in 2012 at the age of 34, having become one of the oldest male pandas in the world.About 1,864 pandas remain in the wild in China, up from around 1,000 in the late 1970s, according to the environmental group WWF.Just over 400 pandas live in zoos around the world, in conservation projects set up with Beijing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/549cb2bdd3aa99e5175ea6ee8f038818ee2a4b0a/0_676_5218_3130/master/5218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=362865d902a067111d917ce89f227e5f","title":"how a formidable female army assisted the biggest mass evacuation in the uk","story":"Women’s Voluntary Services helped move 1.5 million people in three days after outbreak of WW2It was the biggest mass evacuation in the UK, executed over three days, and would not have been possible without an army of women – and one in particular.Eighty years after 1.5 million children, pregnant women and other vulnerable people were displaced from cities to the safer countryside three days before Britain declared war on Germany, the scale of such a feat remains impressive.“They had been preparing since the beginning of the year. More than 120,000 visitors had been going around 5m homes in the country in billeting services, and the majority of those people were Women’s Voluntary Services (WVS) women,” said Matthew McMurray, the keeper of heritage of the RVS (Royal Voluntary Service), as the WVS is now known.The order to evacuate forthwith was made on 31 August 1939. But for more than a year a formidable female army had been recruited and trained, and was in place to execute it flawlessly.They were recruited by Stella Isaacs, the Marchioness of Reading, whom McMurray called “probably one of the most important women in the world in the 20th century that nobody has heard of”. The widow of the former viceroy of India, Rufus Isaacs, started the WVS in March 1938 and by 1940 had recruited more than 1 million women.Archives on the RVS website show her appeal, extolling her “personal magnetism”. “She had an equal magnetism for men and for women. You could go to any large social gathering and find all the men were surrounding Lady Reading, and the beautiful, young women left alone talking to each other,” wrote one contemporary.Many of the WVS members were housewives and mothers, such as Nella Last, whose wartime diaries inspired Housewife, 49, the drama written by and starring the late Victoria Wood.“The housewives service was really about women who can’t get out of their houses, doing small things to help. Become a WVS housewife, you have a card in your window. If your street gets bombed, you’re the person everyone goes to for first aid, or for a cup of tea, or for the emergency services to go to to find out who is missing in your street,” said McMurray.In their spare time, they would knit hats, gloves and scarves for the Arctic convoys. The Red Army in Stalingrad were marching on socks knitted by WVS ladies in Britain. The WVS ran canteens for service personnel, clothes stores for evacuee children and food centres in bombed-out areas, and used furniture centres to help bombed-out people furnish new homes. They collected salvage, including paper for wadding in bullets. Though they weren’t supposed to, some even made molotov cocktails for the home guard. Their duties were innumerable. In 1941, when younger women were required to register for work in factories, they provided nursery care.“This was completely different from the way the Axis powers saw women. Their role in Germany was to bring up the next generation of members of the Third Reich, not to help other people in the way we did in Britain,” said McMurray.He said of the evacuation: “While it’s chaos in those three days, it’s really organised chaos.” The WVS escorted children from their homes to stations, accompanied them on trains, picked them up at their destinations. More than 120,000 were working with the local authorities to make it happen.Not always to everyone’s satisfaction. The WVS archives contain one disgruntled report from Caernarfon, north Wales, on receiving evacuee children and mothers. It reads: “The quota for mothers and babies was exceeded in every case and the type of person evacuated made it impossible to take them into an ordinary home.” It described evacuated women as “abusive, refused to be separated from their friends, and quite without manners and morals”.As bombing didn’t start until the beginning of 1940, many of those evacuated in that first wave returned home, only to have to be evacuated all over again once the air raids began in earnest. A total of 3.75 million would eventually be evacuated.The legacy of those original WVS members born in extraordinary circumstances is continued by the volunteer work RVS undertakes in hospitals and communities today.“I would argue, and I think certain academics would as well, that those women won the war,” added McMurray."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach says claims rising cost will see other projects scrapped are \u0026lsquofake\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquomade-up\u0026rsquoThomas Kavanagh given three year sentence for possession of a stun gunVan driver in his 50s taken to hospital as precautionary measureFlooding caused by a breach of embankment in Shannon which was followed by high tidesMen in 40s and 50s arrested in joint operation between Garda and UK policeAll approved schemes set to go ahead despite overspend on children\u0026rsquos hospitalIncoming Solas chief hopes to include vocational \u0026lsquotaster\u0026rsquo courses in secondary schoolsCost of providing security at such sites and buildings amounted to \u0026euro339,345 last yearNine months after service introduced part-time two-year position to be filledMan attacked by 17-year-old girl gives his view on restorative justice programmeCatholic man and former British soldier use the stage to find their own route to the past analysis shows DPP far more successful than defendants in appealsOffaly woman published several scientific books before fatal car crash 150 years agoManaged forests \u0026lsquomost effective way to help Ireland do its bit for climate change\u0026rsquoBrexit among topics during Irish-American\u0026rsquos three-day stay in Dublin and ClareBackstop represents the \u0026lsquomaximum flexibility\u0026rsquo the EU can offer, says BarnierSocial think tank casts doubt on 2050 timeline for moving to carbon neutral economy"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4004466.1567368791!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"english mechanic decided to leave 1 5m to sinn f%C3%A9in while living in mobile home in ireland","story":"The English mechanic who left £1.5 million (€1.6 million) to Sinn Féin in his will stipulated the money should only go to a political party connected to Gerry Adams.William Edward Hampton, who died in Wales aged 82 on January 11th, 2018, leaving an estate valued at £2.6 million, named two senior republicans -\u0026nbspJoe Cahill and\u0026nbspDessie Mackin\u0026nbsp- as his trustees and executors in a will sworn in June 1997 when he was living in a mobile home in Ireland, reported to be in Co Cavan.Belfast native Mr Cahill, who died in 2004, was former chief-of-staff of the Provisional IRA and later a senior figure in Sinn Féin.

He used a firm of solicitors in Wales as his postal address.He left small sums of cash to four people, including £1,000 each to Labour MP Dennis Skinner and to an investigative journalist with Private Eye magazine, Paul Halloran.All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, to include my assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand and other assets I may have anywhere else in the world I give devise and bequeath to my Executors and Trustees, Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin in trust for the political party in the Republic of Ireland known at this time as Sinn Féin,\u0026nbspaccording to the will which was witnessed by a Co Cavan solicitor.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis money is to be applied by my Executors and Trustees to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Féin offices and advice centres and to aid Republican Prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.For the purposes of clarification the organisation which I intend to benefit is commonly known as Provisional Sinn Féin to distinguish it from Republican Sinn Féin.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireAll potential British solutions to the post-Brexit Border are fraught with difficulty and would leave smaller businesses struggling to cope, UK experts have said, as leaked British government papers outline major concerns just two months before Britain is due to leave the EU.A report summarising the findings of the British government’s official “alternative arrangements” working groups concluded that there are issues with all the scenarios put forward to try to replace the backstop arrangement. There are also specific concerns over whether any technological solution could be delivered to monitor cross-Border trade.Critics said the paper, seen by the , should “ring alarm bells” across government over how likely it is that alternative arrangements to the backstop will be found.The dossier marked “official-sensitive” prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board is dated August 28th. It details how the findings of all advisory groups informing the government on the Border are being kept deliberately under wraps to try to avoid hampering Britain’s intended renegotiation of the backstop agreed to by former prime minister Theresa May.Alternative systems to avoid a hard border after Brexit have become the central tenet of prime minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy. He sees this as a way of unlocking a new deal with Europe and has claimed that there are “abundant solutions”.However, the damning report shows there is no single deliverable solution at present, despite the fact Mr Johnson is almost a third of the way through the “30 days” target that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave him to come up with a fresh Border proposal.The report said: “It is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.”Mr Johnson’s claim that a hard border could be avoided with mobile checks of livestock and crops was dismissed by experts as the most unlikely option to work. The report said: “Overall there were a number of concerns surrounding the deliverability of technological facilitations.”Questions were also raised over whether a trusted trader scheme - the current favourite for a Border solution - would require infrastructure to set it up.MP Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: “As we continue to get closer to 31 October, with Boris Johnson attempting to shut down our democracy, this leaked document rings alarm bells. It proves the government has no deliverable solution to the Irish Border, let alone being able to find one within the next few weeks.“The fact that in this document there is not a single option that can be put forward to the EU as a viable alternative to the backstop, and that No 10 do not want to release these findings as they know Boris Johnson’s bluff will be revealed, simply shows why MPs must come together to stop no deal.”The official report summarises the work of two groups tasked with coming up with Border ideas: advisory groups involving agricultural and food experts, customs and legal specialists and senior Northern Irish figures and a Whitehall-based group which is due to shortly come up with a negotiating position on how to rework the withdrawal agreement to present to the EU.Potential solutionsBorder solutions the report deems as having the most potential are listed as: Regulatory and industry assurance schemes. Trusted trader schemes. Smarter risking (a technological solution that involves data sharing).A Northern Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone to track contamination and disease.There were significant concerns about an artificial intelligence option, which experts felt might not detect disease and chemical contamination of food.Onboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods was also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.Physical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to “targeting” and staff could be at risk, it said.Significantly, smaller businesses in Northern Ireland could suffer through the additional administration required to send and receive goods across the Border, as well as other constraints and costs, the report found. They might also struggle with data collection or be unwilling to share information due to concerns around privacy.“This is because they do not have the existing systems in place and are more likely to have non-standardised products and product ranges,” it said.“However, we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement ?”A spokesperson for the DExEU said: “We don’t comment on leaked documents.”Over the weekend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Ireland would not agree to drop the backstop merely for the “political convenience” of the British prime minister.In a forthright interview with the Sunday Business Post newspaper, he said: “There isn’t a single EU member state putting pressure on Ireland to move away from that position, despite the fact that the UK has spoken to all of them and used all of the persuasion that they can muster to actually move countries away from that position.”He said dropping the backstop would only create problems for Ireland further down the line. “I’m not going to pretend to people that we can do that for political convenience now to get a deal, and then find that Irish politics is dominated by the Border issue indefinitely into the future. We’re not doing that,” he said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Video: AccuWeatherReutersRamond A. King\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSatellite image of Hurricane Dorian 7.05pm Irish time  on Sunday.  Photograph: EPANasa Hurricane Dorian, the second-strongest Atlantic storm on record, pounded the Bahamian islands of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama on Sunday night and was forecast to move dangerously close to Florida in the next two days, US forecasters said.Hazards for the Abaco Islands included storm surges 5.5 to 7 metres (18 to 23 feet) above normal tide levels, with higher destructive waves, the Miami-based US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.At 11 pm (4am Irish time), the hurricane was about 220 km from the Florida coast, parts of which were being evacuated, as it crawled westward. Farther north, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster ordered mandatory evacuations for parts of eight coastal counties effective at noon (5pm Irish time) on Monday.The order covers nearly one million people, many of whom are evacuating for the fourth time in four years.Georgia Governor Brian Kemp ordered evacuations in all or parts of six coastal counties also effective at noon on Monday.Even a glancing blow from one of the strongest storms ever to menace Florida could bring torrential rains and damaging winds, the NHC said.“On this track, the core of extremely dangerous Hurricane Dorian will continue to pound Great Abaco and Grand Bahama islands tonight and Monday,” the NHC said. “The hurricane will move dangerously close to the Florida east coast late Monday through Tuesday night.”Dorian is forecast to remain a hurricane for the next five days, the NHC said. It made landfall on Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands with maximum sustained winds of 295 kph (185 mph) and gusts of more than 354 kph (220 mph).Dorian was the strongest hurricane on record to hit the northwestern Bahamas as a life-threatening Category 5 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale.It was tied with Gilbert (1988), Wilma (2005) and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, based on maximum sustained winds. Allen in 1980 was the most powerful, with 306 kph (190 mph) winds, the NHC said.Julia Eaddy (70) in Titusville, Florida, said she and her husband had ridden out several hurricanes before and were not fazed by the forecast. “I think it will be more of the same,” she said.Several gasoline stations around Titusville were closed. Many grocery stores were open but boarded up. Inside, shelves emptied out fast.Monster stormLike many officials in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis warned residents against becoming complacent after forecasts began saying on Saturday that the state might escape a direct hit.“This storm at this magnitude could really cause massive destruction. Do not put your life in jeopardy by staying behind when you have a chance to get out,” Mr DeSantis said, urging people to heed evacuation orders from county officials.Dozens of Floridians who live in boats in marinas in Brevard County were rushing to secure their vessels, strapping them to docks and removing canvas coverings from decks, but some boat residents said they wanted to ride out Dorian.I will not get off this boat during the hurricane for any reason at all, save a human life,” said Ned Keahey (56). “It’s home.”Residents on Abaco posted video on social media showing floodwaters halfway up the sides of single-family homes with parts of the roofs torn off. Car alarms blared across the island, which was littered with twisted metal and splintered wood.Forecasters predicted up to 76 cm (30 inches) of rain. The storm was moving at just 9 kph (6 mph) on Sunday night, prolonging a pummeling expected to last for hours, the NHC said.Bahamian prime minister Hubert Minnis said in a nationally televised news conference that a “deadly storm and a monster storm” was battering the islands. Homes there are built to withstand winds of at least 241 kph (150 mph), but the expected storm surge was higher than the average roof.“This will put us to a test that we’ve never confronted before,” Mr Minnis said. “This is probably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people.”Palm Beach County, the third most-populated county and home to President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, was among those with partial mandatory evacuations. Other counties announced voluntary evacuations.“This looks like it could be larger than all of them,” Trump said during a briefing with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).FEMA is moving food, water and generators into the Southeastern United States, said acting Administrator Peter Gaynor.Also on Sunday, a new tropical storm formed southwest of Mexico and was expected to become a hurricane on Monday, the NHC said. Tropical Storm Juliette was 735 km (455 miles) from Manzanillo, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 95 kph (60 mph), the NHC said.–Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.\u0026#39Categorically evil\u0026#39 killer of Australian comedian Eurydice Dixon sentenced to 35 yearsBrexit latest news: Cabinet meeting called amid growing speculation election will be called this week Tony Blair warns Jeremy Corbyn a general election would produce a \u0026#39comfortable Tory majority\u0026#3911 must-see art exhibitions for Autumn 2019Comment: All the Great British Bake Off series ranked, from worst to bestHow tax on your holidays has risen by up to 700 per cent in 11 yearsBrussels would reluctantly agree Brexit extension if rebel MPs succeed in preventing no-dealAustralian man makes \u0026#39amazing\u0026#39 solo landing during first flying lessonAutumn Equinox 2019: The science behind the changing seasonsGet Ready for Brexit campaign launches as Government rolls out billboards, posters and websiteFriday the 13th 2019: How cyclones, asteroids and a Buckingham Palace bombing have fed the superstitionComment: Tory Brexiteers\u0026#39 claim that WTO rules let them pull a rabbit out of the hat is pure magical thinkingHow would a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s government work, and will he win?How could a no-deal Brexit affect the UK?Comment: Parliament\u0026#39s big Brexit battle will be won by whoever is most ruthless — here\u0026#39s why my money\u0026#39s on Boris Hurricane Dorian tears roofs from buildings as it makes landfall in BahamasBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEs Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesAt least two children in every class contemplates suicide because of bullying, study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2018/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000177566084_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?i","title":"brexit britain has takes worlds tastiest nation","story":"How many would have scoffed a few decades ago at the idea of English vineyards with smart restaurantsFrom superb cheeses to terrific wines, we have all the ingredients to be a serious gastronomic player  A summer’s evening recently and I was sipping a glass of Sussex.

There is still a piece missing and the work starts now.”The AfD celebrated significant gains despite failing to win first place in either stateThe AfD led in the Brandenburg polls for much of the campaign and was widely expected to win first place in a regional election for the first time.But it was held at bay by a late swing towards the established parties amid a dramatic rise in turnout.The result will ease the immediate pressure on Mrs Merkel and her chosen successor as CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has endured a difficult first year in charge.But the CDU still suffered its worst ever result in its former stronghold of Saxony, and now faces a difficult task building a new coalition in the fractured regional parliament.The election leaves the CDU ided, after Mr Kretschmer pulled the party back in the polls by distancing himself from Mrs Merkel’s national government, and a right-wing faction held its own separate victory celebrations last night.The SPD was neck-and-neck with the AfD in the Brandenburg polls right up until voting opened, and the party was celebrating an unexpected comeback last night.But it still suffered significant losses at the AfD’s hands in a state it has ruled since reunification, and will now need two partners to build a new regional coalition.The AfD was hoping for a strong result in its heartlands in the former communist east to offset a disappointing 12 months which saw it come fourth in the European elections and fail to make a breakthrough in the more populous west.Alternative for Germany (AfD)\u0026#39Categorically evil\u0026#39 killer of Australian comedian Eurydice Dixon sentenced to 35 yearsBrexit latest news: Cabinet meeting called amid growing speculation election will be called this week Tony Blair warns Jeremy Corbyn a general election would produce a \u0026#39comfortable Tory majority\u0026#3911 must-see art exhibitions for Autumn 2019Comment: All the Great British Bake Off series ranked, from worst to bestHow tax on your holidays has risen by up to 700 per cent in 11 yearsBrussels would reluctantly agree Brexit extension if rebel MPs succeed in preventing no-dealAustralian man makes \u0026#39amazing\u0026#39 solo landing during first flying lessonAutumn Equinox 2019: The science behind the changing seasonsGet Ready for Brexit campaign launches as Government rolls out billboards, posters and websiteFriday the 13th 2019: How cyclones, asteroids and a Buckingham Palace bombing have fed the superstitionComment: Tory Brexiteers\u0026#39 claim that WTO rules let them pull a rabbit out of the hat is pure magical thinkingHow would a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s government work, and will he win?How could a no-deal Brexit affect the UK?Comment: Parliament\u0026#39s big Brexit battle will be won by whoever is most ruthless — here\u0026#39s why my money\u0026#39s on Boris Hurricane Dorian tears roofs from buildings as it makes landfall in BahamasBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEs Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesAt least two children in every class contemplates suicide because of bullying, study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/01/10/Car-manufacturing.jpg","title":"brexit no deal uk manufacturing output pmi economy","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the options\u0027Creeping dread\u0027 descends on sector as Britain\u0027s exit from EU loomsClick to followThe IndependentThe UK’s manufacturing output slumped to a seven-year low last month as uncertainty over Brexit and a global economic downturn hurt\u0026nbspdemand, the latest snapshot survey has found.The sector shrank at the fastest rate since 2012 in August, the fourth consecutive month of contraction, according to the closely watched\u0026nbspIHS MarkitCIPS\u0026nbsppurchasing managers index (PMI.)\u0026nbspThe index fell to 47.4 last month, down from 48 in July.

Investment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the UK’s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity.“As Brexit planning intensifies, some firms were resorting to more inventory building whilst others were unravelling their stocks. With some supplies impacted by port delays and poor supplier performance, a creeping dread is descending on the sector that there will be more of these obstacles to come.”Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if you put him in front of a computer, his behaviour changed – for the better.”If he got it wrong, he could start again. “He could fail without humiliation,” says Shermer when we meet up in London. The computer had infinite patience and it wasn’t judgemental.Which is what gave him the idea to build a dedicated computer room for the other inmates and develop what became known as “Tech4Good”, inspiring otherwise underskilled young people. Working for the NHS with EU funding, he was soon tailoring tech around Europe to improve the lives of anyone with a disability.There was a man in Antwerp with a brainstem injury who could only twitch a finger: Shermer dreamed up a glove with sensors that enabled him to type. He adapted a Psion organiser to give a voice to a woman who had lost the power of speech. The victim of a road accident who could only move his chin was able to operate a keyboard Shermer had tweaked. “The tragedy was that these were one-offs and not generally available,” he says.And everything cost too much. He made a plug-in power outlet you could control with the blink of an eye (literally). But each unit cost £150 each and he could only make a few hundred.The idea of starting his own company was to bring the price down and\u0026nbspmake more units – for anyone and everyone, with or without a disability. “The\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspwas spending millions but I didn’t think they were spending it wisely,” he explains, adding: “My wife was appalled when I quit.” But he got the price down to £10 per unit and was making 10,000 at a time.\u0026nbspNow 63, Shermer was born in West Bromwich. His father worked on Spaghetti Junction and the young Shermer would go to the factory on a Saturday to watch him putting it together. He built his own hi-fi from scratch aged 11. He was chronically dyslexic\u0026nbsp(as are his own children) but was saved by predictive typing and audiobooks. Shermer describes his job as “liberating people”.He was inspired in part by a meeting with Stephen Hawking in the mid-90s at the Dorchester in London, when they talked about the future of disability and tech. Lightwave started off, 12 years ago, enabling NHS patients to be independent at home.Even if they couldn’t move too well they could still turn the lights on and off and answer the phone. It was smart home technology before it became fashionable. “We changed the lives of thousands of people,” he says. “You had to make it simple and it had to be robust: people’s lives depended on it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fundamental physics is flawed. The waves won’t go through walls. The frequency is wrong.” Lightwave, however, uses a dedicated radio protocol.The emergence of the smartphone transformed the business for Shermer. “It’s democratising,” he says. Anyone can use their phone to control all the appliances in their home, remotely. In January 2012,\u0026nbspLightwave produced a pioneering “gateway” device for a house. “We made all the mistakes,” he says, “but now it works.”Lightwave is still based in Birmingham and uses local engineers.\u0026nbspThey design all their own apps. He started with two employees and now it’s up to 60-plus. He reckons that dyslexia helps\u0026nbspin some ways. “I can’t write long reports but I can stand and talk all day long,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I can’t code either, but I do have the ideas.” He carries a “daybook” around with him in which he sets down his latest brainwave.Shermer says that Alexa and other virtual assistants have also made a big difference on the domestic front. Fifty per cent\u0026nbspof all commands are now sent via voice. His own mother is 87. “She can’t use a computer but she can still talk to Alexa,” he says.Shermer is proud of being “an unknown little British tech company” up against the giants of the industry. “They’re still getting it wrong,” he says. Apple invited him to Ireland for talks. They wanted to put an Apple chip in all his products and gave him 48 hours to consider. Shermer said he didn’t need 48 hours and turned them down flat. “We’re dealing with people’s lives,” he said. “It has to work.” Now Lightwave products are on sale in Apple stores.How two childhood friends became sports-pub matchmakers‘Don’t be afraid of AI’: Daniel Pitchford debunks technology mythsHow Daniel Nivern created an international recruitment agency in ChinaWhether you have dementia or you’re easily distracted, it’s useful to have the kind of kit that can spot if you left the cooker on.\u0026nbsp “We don’t make gadgets,” Shermer says dismissively. “We make things that screw to the fabric of your house. Stuff that’s permanent and increases the value of your home.” Lightwave are also collaborating with housing providers and companies such as\u0026nbspHoneywell to create iPhone-ready homes. The technology is built into the architecture.Shermer now works with the likes of Google and Amazon. “But we stand our corner,” he says. He reckons that the larger companies are at a disadvantage in that they produce generic products, whereas Lightwave can be more bespoke. “They’re top-down, whereas we grew up looking at it from the user’s point of view.”Shermer reckons he could also come up with a much better system for Hawking if he was still around. “It was a slow, stilted conversation with him. He would take a minute to say ‘I agree’. And it was an American voice system. There are still tens of thousands in his situation who would benefit.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

Investment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the UK’s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity.“As Brexit planning intensifies, some firms were resorting to more inventory building whilst others were unravelling their stocks. With some supplies impacted by port delays and poor supplier performance, a creeping dread is descending on the sector that there will be more of these obstacles to come.”Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We saw no prospects of returning the Orb business to profitability in the coming years.“I recognise how difficult this news will be for all those affected and we will work very hard to support them.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and the Island Sailing Club take part during the annual cricket match between the clubs, which takes place on the Bramble Bank sandbank in the middle of the Solent at low tideAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate at Whitehall in LondonOne of the iconic \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 artworks by anonymous street artist Banksy is carried near one of the original locations the artwork appeared at on the Southbank in LondonThe sun rises over the sculpture The Couple by artist Sean Henry, at Newbiggin-by-the-sea in NorthumberlandA person wearing a Boris Johnson \u0027head\u0027 digs a grave at the foot of a tombstone during a protest organised by Avaaz and Best for Britain, outside Downing Street in LondonNat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

What is the government proposing for those who remain in the profession, taking on more responsibilities as they gain experience?“This is a key issue. England has one of the worst teacher retention rates in the OECD with almost half of teachers leaving within 10 years – taking with them vast amounts of knowledge and experience.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.The film, which is already sparking Oscars buzz, was described by The Independent’s film critic Geoffrey Macnab as “powerful and original. He added\u0026nbspthat Phoenix plays the character “in a way that makes him seem both sympathetic and very creepy”.Joker will be released in UK cinemas on 4 October 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So often are locals now being asked a single repeated question – “where’s the dam?” – there are proposals to create special signage to point daytrippers in the right direction.The Chernobyl effect is what some are calling it – although, says Martin Thomas, chair of Whaley Bridge Town Council:\u0026nbsp“Obviously there’s no danger of radiation here.”Created with Sketch.

The town is at threat from the dam wall collapse at the nearby Toddbrook ReservoirOn a sunny day, it is easy to see why there is a flood (no pun intended) of visitors arriving.The place –\u0026nbsppopulation 6,000 –\u0026nbspis as picturesque as any of its more famed Peak District neighbours, Buxton, Bakewell and Edale included. There are good pubs, quaint cafes, independent shops and art galleries –\u0026nbspas well as all-important chippy –\u0026nbspdotting the higgledy-piggledy streets. Both the Peak Forest Canal and River Goyt run through the valley. The walking on the hills offers unrivalled views.“It’s always been a lovely place,” Cllr Thomas, who has lived here 35 years, tells The Independent. “But perhaps it’s been a bit of a secret. The difference now is that it suddenly has a national profile. People have seen it is on the news, and they’ve come along to have a look for themselves.”Whaley Bridge residents gather at evacuation centre after dam collapseVisitors are intrigued by what happened, too, the 65-year-old reckons. Many ask about those seven August days when emergency workers, engineers and a now famous RAF Chinook helicopter worked around the clock to secure the failing Toddbrook Reservoir. Plenty walk through Memorial Park to see the towering 188-year-old dam itself.“As a story, it has everything,” Cllr Thomas says. “Near disaster, heroism and a community pulling together. No-one’s saying visitors come just to look at the dam – although it is impressive – but, if they’re looking to spend a day in the Peak District, they are now considering Whaley Bridge in a way they didn’t before.”Certainly, there is much evidence to support the claim.The not-for-profit Footsteps community café in Market Street –\u0026nbspwhich Cllr Thomas is a director of –\u0026nbsphas taken more than £2,000 since it reopened on 8 August,\u0026nbsp after the evacuation ended. In the same period last year, that figure was just £804. A display in its window showing pictures of the dam and the rescue effort, meanwhile, has proven so popular the photographer has turned the images into a commemorative book. An initial run of 75 sold out within days. More than 400 have since been bought.“People like the helicopter pictures,” shruggs manager Anne Leyland, 77, when I ask about the book’s popularity. “They want to remember how it looked, up there in the sky.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA specially-created T-shirt has proven to be a similar hit: “Keep your Chinook up,”\u0026nbspit says across the chest.“The support shown by visitors has been more than we could ever have hoped for,” says Fiona Douglas-Mullett, co-owner of the Little Fika eaterie in Canal Street. “There’s a lot of people coming from over parts of the the north west and Midlands especially. They say they want to help by spending their money here, which is such a moving gesture.”Ms Douglas-Mullett, a mother-of-two who has lived here for two years, had her parents visit from their native Dorset not long after the near collapse. “One of the first things my dad asked was to see the dam,” she says.Little Fika, itself, has doubled its takings in August compared to July – although it did lose nearly £500 of fresh food during the evacuation.Nearby at Jarva Gallery in Market Street, owner Lyndsey Selley doesn’t have sales figures but reckons footfall in her art and jewellery store is massively up over the past three weeks.Whaley Bridge residents allowed to return home after evacuationResidents ‘increasingly fed up’ as handful are allowed to return homeWhaley Bridge residents criticised for ‘putting lives at risk’Whaley Bridge residents refuse to evacuate despite flood riskWhaley Bridge villagers may not be allowed home for six more daysEngineers race against time to stop dam bursting over Whaley BridgeIt seems, I suggest, like a little disaster might be a good idea every summer?“I don’t think our nerves could stand it,” she laughs. “But, as a business community, the challenge now is to build on what’s happened and make sure we take advantage of the raised profile.”A meeting with just this end in mind took place last week between local traders, High Peak Borough Council, Derbyshire County Council and Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire.The decisions taken have been criticised as a little lightweight – an online video is to be made and, if funding can be found, new signs installed and old ones improved – but Lindsay Rae, deputy director of Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire, reckons the benefits can be long-term.“We now have to work hard to capitalise by making sure every visitor here leaves with the best possible impression so they go away and tell their friends, who then also visit,” she says. “There’s no reason this can’t be self-perpetuating.”Certainly, that’s also the hope of John Wakeham, owner of Springbank Guest House in Reservoir Road.He says he’s had cancellations from holiday-makers now apparently apprehensive about staying in a town which sits under a vast 19th century reservoir – but that such drop-outs have been matched by last-minute bookings from visitors who, it seems, do want to stay in exactly such a place.“It’s been a six and two-threes for us,“ he says. “No business wants cancellations, but they’ve mainly been evened out by the new guests. We can’t complain. I suppose the whole things has made Whaley unique.”Not everyone has benefited, it should be said.The week-long closure forced by the evacuation inevitably meant lost money, while house prices are understood to have fallen in the aftermath. Several sales have collapsed.There is some anger, too, at the Canal and River Trust, which manages the reservoir. Residents are asking why inspections did not reveal potential issues with the dam – a question currently being addressed, the trust says, in an independent inquiry.The reservoir itself, meanwhile, will stay shut for an estimated three years while the wall is fixed,\u0026nbspthe cost of which could run into tens of millions of pounds.But for now, back at Footsteps cafe, Cllr Thomas remains sure the long-term positives of the collapse will outweigh the negatives.“I’ve walked through the place the last few week and the shops are bursting at the seems, the sun is shining, the community is out spending money with each other,” he says. “It’s been wonderful to see. Whatever happens now, it’s been a summer no-one will forget.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When Kamala Harris, an African American senator from California who is seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, cautiously voiced support for studying whether there ought to be reparations for slavery – “We had more than 200 years of slavery. We had Jim Crow for almost a century. We had legalised discrimination, segregation. We have to recognise that everybody did not start out on an equal footing” – she faced a major backlash.These conversations come at a fraught time for the nation. Donald Trump may\u0026nbspor may not be\u0026nbspmore racist than\u0026nbspsome of those who preceded him in the Oval Office, but he is more prepared to use racist language openly. The imprimatur of those words as commander-in-chief, allied to the massive power of social media, has emboldened many who share his views, but who may not previously have voiced then aloud.“In the past we had coded language. Now it is more direct,” says Cassandra Newby-Alexander, professor of history at Norfolk State University, located 50 miles from Jamestown, where the English warship White Lion unloaded its human cargo. “There is a step-by-step process to embolden this racism, but I think it may only work for one-third of people. There are more white people unhappy with this level of hate speech.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA fundamental reason for America’s refusal to acknowledge its past – not alone among nations – says writer Rachel Swarns, is that it is “hard history”. Two hundred years of slavery was followed by the Civil War, an event that somehow inspired twisted racists such as the Charleston church killer Dylann Roof the intentional failure of reform during Reconstruction, and then the system of Jim Crow, in which black people were returned to being second-class citizens, lynched, murdered, refused the right to live in certain areas and even to vote.\u0026nbspToday, efforts to suppress the voting rights of minorities persist with vigour in states such as Georgia, while the criminal justice system is utterly discriminatory against people of colour. Three years ago, when the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) announced plans to establish a museum to lynching victims, it estimated at least 4,000 African Americans were summarily murdered – their killings frequently watched by large crowds – between between 1877 and 1950.\u0026nbspWreckage of last ship used to bring slaves to America found in Alabama“It is hard history, and it’s particularly hard for Americans because it runs counter to the narrative we tell about ourselves – you know, freedom and justice for all,” says Swarns, whose work includes American Tapestry: The Story of the Black, White, and Multiracial Ancestors of Michelle Obama.“I think it is much easier to think about slavery as something that is very disconnected from us – long time ago, history book-slow, nothing to do with me today. We’re often known for not being big at looking in the rear view mirror.”She adds: “Coming to an understanding that slavery was as foundational as it was for a country that expounds these ideals\u0026nbspis profoundly difficult. That is on a macro level. At a personal level, I think it is just difficult for people.”Among Swarns’ revelations was that the founders of Georgetown University in Washington DC, which was established by Jesuits, owned slaves. Her 2017 report triggered reflection by a number of US universities where slavery had contributed to their wealth, as well as half-a-dozen in Britain, among them the universities of Oxford, Glasgow, Bristol and East London.Earlier this year, students at Georgetown voted to pay additional tuition fees to help establish a fund to benefit\u0026nbspthe descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold in 1838 to pay off the institution’s debts.Swarns, a contributing writer for the New York Times and associate professor of journalism at New York University, says such gestures give her hope, just as incidents such as the 2017 neo-Nazi march at Charlottesville, make her despair. She says this dichotomy, the shifting back and forth of progress, is also part of America’s story.Carol Anderson, professor of African American Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, has written about the backlash triggered among some white Americans following the election of Barack Obama, the country’s first and only African American president. The reemergence of Tea Party activists, and congressional obstruction, was part a pattern dating to the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment that officially\u0026nbspended slavery.Each time African Americans have made advances, she says in her book White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, white reaction has resulted in a deliberate roll back. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with the Jim Crow era, the Supreme Court’s Brown v Board of Education decision resulted in the shutting down of schools in the South, while the bloody opposition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to a new, coded response – the so-called Southern Strategy and the “war on drugs”, that took the vote from millions of black people, while helping project Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan into the White House.Anderson tells The Independent the US is currently ided between those states wanting to expand access to the ballot box and make the electorate more inclusive, and those seeking to restrict access, in order to reduce the number of minority voters.Why won’t the UK even talk about reparations for slavery?Cory Booker gets 12 co-sponsors on slavery reparations billModern slavery victims ‘sent back to addresses where they were abused’Cambridge slavery inquiry will show we have plenty to feel guilty forSome Americans believe the events of 1619 should not be memorialised at all. When the New York Times magazine announced it was dedicating an issue to mark the arrival of the the first enslaved Africans and what that presaged, a number accused the newspaper of stoking racial tensions.Newt Gringrich, a former Republican speaker of the House and a close ally of Trump, tweeted: “The New York Times 1619 Project should make its slogan ‘All the propaganda we want to brainwash you with’.”Burr, the writer and academic from New Mexico who discovered her link to America’s third vice president, says the opposite. In her words, Americans cannot talk enough what happened, both then and now.“The reason people don’t want to talk about slavery is that they don’t want to dig up the past. They don’t want to take responsibility,” she says.\u0026nbsp“All aspects of what happened to those original Africans, and what happened afterwards, should be discovered and analysed. Not enough people can be told about the 400th anniversary, not enough speeches can happen.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When there isn’t enough water, I can’t even make food on time or feed my children,” says Aherwal, 28, who became a Jal Saheli in her village of Agroutha in April.“This will help solve our water problem. Our village will be able to drink water. We will get to irrigate our crops again.”One of India’s biggest cities has almost run out of waterIn earlier times, Bundelkhand, blighted by 13 episodes of drought in the last two decades, received 52 days of rainfall a year. But the number of days has more than halved since 2014, according to Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.That has led to repeated and widespread crop failures in a region\u0026nbspthat is dependent on agriculture, prompting a growing tide\u0026nbspof farmers to migrate to nearby cities.Women and children often bear the brunt of water shortages – from domestic violence as tensions rise in water-short homes to missed\u0026nbspschool days and child marriage, according to local water conservation\u0026nbspexperts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s how bad it was.”But things have changed since 2016 after Tara and two other Sahelis talked about the need for water conservation in their village and gathered dozens of people to revive their community pond and wells, and install new hand pumps.We see ads on TV that show water flowing from taps, from showers and think ‘Wow, we should move to the city’. But that is a false dream, at least for people like us who have no money. So it is better to make changes hereNow washing dishes, cooking, mopping, doing the laundry, bathing, farming and taking care of livestock are much easier, says\u0026nbspGeeta, another Saheli who goes by one name.“If there is water, we have everything and if there is no water, we have nothing,” she says, gesturing to Manpur’s brimming pond where buffaloes wallow\u0026nbspto beat the heat.Rural Indian women make good managers and protectors of natural resources, says\u0026nbspReetu Sogani, a researcher on traditional knowledge, gender and climate change.“Because they interact so closely with their natural surroundings and they know what kind of problems they face in day-to-day life ... they come up with solutions and adaptation mechanisms based on their knowledge,” she says.For many women, it hasn’t been easy to become Jal Sahelis in a male-dominated, conservative region, where age-old customs dictate a woman’s life.“My husband got upset and asked ‘Why are you going out?’\u0026nbsp’Where are you roaming around?’ ... ‘You aren’t even getting paid, what is the point?’,” says Aherwal, who makes up to 6,000 rupees (£70) a month rolling traditional cigarettes at home.“I endured all his anger, his scoldings to join this group.”Several Sahelis say their husbands and in-laws eased up after noticing the water situation\u0026nbspimproving – and the women weren’t cutting corners at home.Dargai Khurd village (AFPGetty)After their chores and work at home, most women can carve out only two hours a day for their Saheli work, they say.That can involve creating a water conservation plan for their village, participating in local council talks, meeting government officials, and learning how to use tools to fix wells and hand pumps – a chore traditionally done by men.Sanjay Singh, the secretary of Parmarth Samaj Sevi Sansthan, a grassroots charity behind the Jal Saheli programme, says the women are now more involved in household and village decisions, leading to effective change in some places.“The index of happiness has increased (in the region),” he says.Everything you need to know about getting rupees and visas for IndiaKashmir on lockdown after India reimposes curfew and deploys troopsIndia orders schools to reopen, but Kashmiri parents keep kids at homeBindrawan Lodi, a 60-year-old farmer, agrees. He says without the Sahelis’ push to revive their community pond, his Chaukheda village would have been in “a lot of trouble”.“This place was bone dry. Now we have enough water to irrigate our crops. Drinking water is still a struggle ... but this is a start,” he says.Bundelkhand, once a region green with dense forests and fields, is increasingly barren with little groundwater.The area’s rocky terrain largely stops rainwater from percolating\u0026nbspinto aquifers, Singh says. Loss of forests also has hit\u0026nbsprainfall, and water reservoirs have sometimes been used wastefully, residents say.Although civil society and government agencies have ramped up water conservation efforts, Singh warns that\u0026nbspmuch more needs\u0026nbspto be done before the “dangerous” effects of climate change exacerbate problems of unemployment, malnutrition and migration.Two in five people in rural Bundelkhand have become urban migrants over the last decade, according to estimates by activists from the Bundelkhand Water Forum, a coalition of local organisations.Singh says more private investment, bigger government budgets, work restoring trees and other greenery and climate adaptation techniques, such as growing less water-intensive crops, could help stem the exodus.That is one of the reasons\u0026nbspthe Sahelis say\u0026nbspthey work so hard. They want to ensure their children can stay put and their daughters or daughters-in-law can live a life free of water worries.“We see ads on TV that show water flowing from taps, from showers and think ‘Wow, we should move to the city’. But that is a false dream, at least for people like us who have no money. So it is better to make changes here,” says Aherwal.“Our village will become beautiful in the next five years. All you will see is water everywhere.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In Brandenburg, a state adjacent to Berlin, the centre-left SPD remained the largest party with 26 per cent of the vote, while the AfD trailed with 23.5 per cent. In Saxony, the centre-right CDU topped the polls with 32.5 per cent, with the AfD behind on 27.8 per cent.\u0026nbspThe AfD increased its vote by 11 per cent and 18 per cent respectively on the last state elections, showing that while it may not be set to dominate German politics, it is seemingly here to stay as a major force - particularly in the East of the country.We\u0027re satisfied in Brandenburg as well as in Saxony, AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland said, claiming his party had punished Angela Merkel\u0027s CDU.Students protest against lecturer standing for far-right AfD partyGermany\u0027s far-right AfD banned from attending Holocaust memorialsGerman teachers mass report themselves to far-right AfDThe higher-than-expected turnout reflects recent trends elsewhere in Europe. In Sweden last year, the far-right Sweden Democrats were denied a victory in national elections after more voters turned out than in previous years to oppose them than had been expected.A study from the academics at the LSE Conflict and Civil Society Research Unit, released on Sunday found a significant difference between the composition of AfD support in west Germany and East Germany.\u0026nbspNeither a high unemployment rate nor living in a neighbourhood with a higher proportion of foreigners corresponds to a greater willingness to vote for the AfD, they found.\u0026nbspIn the West, the AfD scores particularly well where voters have below-average household incomes andor work in the manufacturing industry.\u0026nbspWorkers and the unemployed, although overrepresented among AfD voters in comparison to other parties, account for only a quarter of the total AfD electorate. The remaining three quarters are salaried employees, civil servants and the self-employed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

The AfD’s success is really a story about emigration, not immigration. Former East German states which have seen large outflows of young people moving to the West, leaving behind aging populations and stagnating economies, have proven to be particularly fertile electoral ground to the nationalist discourses of the AfD.Titus Molkenbur, a research consultant at the LSE Conflict and Civil Society research unit, added: “While the AfD’s advance has been successfully contained in western Germany, this isn’t the case in the East.\u0026nbspThe electoral pressure they are bringing to bear on the traditional centre-right is huge. We see a big debate now in the CDU between those that favour cooperation with the AfD and reject the current containment policy. The danger of a slow burn adaptation to extreme right sentiment is very serious.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Well, now it’s his turn to squirm.I have no idea of his exact involvement with the hideous pervert Jeffrey Epstein during their “friendship”, but this week one of Epstein’s alleged victims claimed she had sex with Andrew three times. Virginia Roberts, photographed being embraced by the prince when she was a teenager, claimed he “knows exactly what he has done” and should “come clean” about it.The waters are being muddied with claims by “friends” of Andrew the photo is fake. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing but this story is not going to go away and people are demanding answers.Epstein hanged himself in his New York jail cell this month while on sex-trafficking charges — and sparked conspiracy theories galore.Andrew claims he knew nothing about Epstein’s disgusting lestyle, but it is baffling that he continued to associate with him even after Epstein’s conviction in  for procuring an underage girl for prostitution, making him a registered sex offender.Why on Earth would anyone continue to hang out with such an unsavoury character, especially , like Andrew, you are a dad with two daughters of your own  At the very least this scandal shows that Andrew has appalling judgment when it comes to his pals and associates.He has previous when it comes to cosying up to the rich and dubious. Questions were asked when Andrew sold his run-down “Southyork” mansion to a Kazakh oligarch in  for millions over the asking price.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   as-comp-kav.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTrevor Kavanagh If only Remainer rabble would see the light like Archbishop of Canterbury \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   Tm-comp-Hammond-Bojo-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Tory Remainers arent trying to protect jobs, theyre trying to stop Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Jeremy Corbyn and panic-stricken Remainers are now resorting to blatant lies \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-james-forsyth.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentJAMES FORSYTH Its rogue ones vs. prorogue ones as MPs fight to seize control of Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN ON SUNDAY SAYS Emmanuel Macron is now bending as European fears about No Deal grow \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Ian-Duncan.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentIAIN DUNCAN SMITH Corbyns hate mob are the ones staging a coup with anti-Brexit marches Again, he denied any wrongdoing and the scandal went away. That might not be the case this time around. He’s very lucky that the Queen continues to stand by him. Andrew is always cited as her favourite child and Her Majesty accepts her son’s vehement denials when it comes to Epstein.He also has the full support of ex-we Sarah Ferguson, who knows all too well what it is like to be caught up in a scandal. She was apparently financially “assisted” by Epstein, something she now regrets.Sarah and Andrew have been lying low on holiday together, sparking rumours they are back together. But even this odd couple realised Andrew playing his usual rounds of golf in the Spanish sunshine looked callous.They are back for “crisis talks” and I don’t envy the royal advisers who have to try to spin this one. No one is saying Andrew has committed any sort of crime, but anything that has Epstein’s grubby fingerprints all over it inevitably reeks to high heaven.And the Prince has done his reputation irreparable harm by his association with such a contemptible sexual predator. We are light years away from the dashing young prince who won the respect and admiration of the British public for his role in the Falklands War.He has never reached the heady heights of that level of popularity since, and clearly he never will again. But he could redeem himself by at least being willing to answer questions from investigators in the States.Being a royal should not mean he is above helping law enforcement. It might be embarrassing and uncomfortable — butAndrew has done nothing wrong, he has nothing to worry about.NEVER mind the nights drawing in, you know our summer days are numbered when Strictly rears its sequinned head. This year has the potential to be a classic.I always look forward to seeing the celebs step into the spray tan booth, embrace the glitz and rhinestones and unleash their inner as. But my ones-to-watch this year have actually already found theirs.Michelle Visage from Ru Paul’s Drag Race and ex-Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley both have big personalities, raucous laughs and are women after my own heart.Michelle has been very open about her struggles with an eating disorder, and recently had her breast implants removed due to health concerns. She’s a fierce campaigner for more understanding about the side-effects of breast enhancement ops.Catherine has always wanted to be a dancer but said this week that being overweight as a youngster scuppered her chances of tripping the light fantastic.She famously lost st and promotes sensible eating and exercise as the only way to shed weight, which is something I’ve been banging on about forever. Both are at the top of their game and raring to go.They will burn up the dancefloor and provide us with some memorable moments . . .  but as they are both happily married, these will all thankfully be Strictly confined to the ballroom floor.WHAT in the name of Rule Britannia is going on with British Airways  They are lurching from crisis to crisis, with computer glitches and strikes almost becoming the norm.Last week I had to cancel a long-awaited trip to Orkney because of the proposed industrial action next month by BA pilots, after receiving an email to say my flight had been axed. With a heavy heart, I apologetically cancelled the glorious Foveran Hotel, our car hire and the babysitter for our dog son Angus.The next day another computer-generated email popped up telling me that actually the flight wasn’t cancelled after all. Oops, and all that. Now I’ve been trying to get some clarity from the BA hotline for days – with no joy.I’m reluctant to rebook everything in case it all goes t*ts-up again and they cancel the flights for a second time. It’s infuriating, stressful and upsetting. Behind every cancelled or delayed flight are heartbreaking stories of people missing weddings, hospital visits, funerals and job interviews.Can I stress emphatically that, in my experience, BA staff at the check-in coal face, who have to deal with distraught and angry passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, deserve a blinking medal for their patience and forbearance in dealing with the recent avalanche of almighty management cock-ups.Likewise, those battling valiantly in customer service, and all of the stalwart cabin crew, especially those with years of experience who are unfailingly professional, caring and kind.They are being as badly let down as us passengers, and it’s depressing to see a once proud and noble British brand shooting itself in the foot.Those at the very top really don’t deserve their hardworking staff and they also have to stop taking us customers for granted.NORMALLY I view those “scientic studies” about the benefits or detriments of certain food and drink with folded arms and a very sceptical: “Aye, right.”It might, however, be worth paying attention to the very latest one which concludes that red wine really is good for you.We already knew about the benefits for your heart, but now it turns out red wine could improve digestion and protect you against issues with high cholesterol.I reckon the men and women in white lab coats have a point.Cheers!I’VE been lucky enough to have spent the past couple of weeks travelling around Rajasthan in India.I happily scoffed some form of curry three times a day for every meal and guzzled very impressive Indian wine.I’m now addicted to dosa with daal and spicy mint sauce for breakfast – followed throughout the day by chilli paneer and laal maas all washed down with endless cups of masala tea.Halfway through the trip, I rather naively posted a snap of myself, right, taken by the pool during our stay in Shahpura Bagh, on the way to Jodhpur. It showed that my excess holiday baggage had mainly landed around my tummy.Some people were very kind about my -year-old unfiltered, non- Photoshopped body, my make-up-free face and flyaway hair. Others not so much.All I wanted to do was show that you don’t have to be body perfect to wear a bikini and smile in the sunshine when you are on holiday.We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about a few lumps and bumps or scars and blemishes and we need to stop beating ourselves up all the time and learn to celebrate our so-called flaws. Le really is too short.SHAME on all of those chortling at little Prince George because he is taking ballet lessons. I’m sure none of the mockers have ever actually met a male ballet dancer.Those fellas are as tough as nails.They can beat a bully into a pulp with one flick of their sinewy wrists. They are mentally and physically fiercely strong.I can’t think of a better way for the future king to learn discipline, teamwork and how to push himself to the limit.

With the connivance of the Speaker John Bercow, they will almost certainly succeed.Having gained this power, they will set about binding Boris Johnson’s hands. They will try to legislate to ensure this country cannot leave the European Union without a deal.Do they have the numbers to pull this off  Probably, yes.The ranks of Tory rebels have been swelled by the arrival of former Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke, and the Government’s decision to prorogue Parliament means that plans to wait until the end of September to act have been dropped.One former minister says the “prorogation scandal has tipped things over the edge”.If they have the numbers, do they have the time  This is more doubtful.No’s decision to prorogue Parliament means they would have to get a bill through both Houses in just over a week. With Bercow’s help, it will be possible for them to rush it through the Commons quickly. But it will be much harder to do that in the Lords.One Brexit-backing former Secretary of State tells me: “Our lot down there will do their best to talk it out.”Eventhe rebels can get a bill passed, the Government’s actions this week are designed to show that they won’t simply comply with it. They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And guess what has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause “Excessive social media use.”Anyone surprised by that either  Thought not.Of course, not all children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning shot. Because when it comes to our children’s happiness, the trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.With social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.Most grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable “my perfect le” posts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.Butyou are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate’s Instagram page of the le you are “meant” to be living could make even the most secure children begin to feel inadequate.The other problem is that it’s always “on” — and so are our kids. It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are happy and get the care they need.They are loved. I find it very rewarding to be a mum.Being a mum of so many kids is hard but I love it - they are all so loving.Mark has several seizures a week. Bethan said: When he fits, he just collapses and, when he comes out of a fit, he screams. He can not handle the little ones and likes being on his own.Usually Bethan gets up at around am to prepare breakfast for everyone and sort out all the medication for the day and ensure everyone gets the correct ones.Teenager Mark gets picked up by a taxi to take him to school in Bryncoch while Bethan and Andy then do the school run in two cars for the rest.While the kids are at school Bethan then spends her time cleaning and tidying the house.After the children have all been picked up from school Bethan will then start on dinner.She said:  I can not cook so I just try to make things quickly like beans or sausages.I try to have dinner ready shortly after they get back from school.If it has been a long day and it is getting late, we will get a KFC or a McDonalds.The family say they have fast food once or twice a week with each of these meals costing up to £.They also do a big monthly food shop at Farm Foods which costs £. This includes around £ on sausages and six boxes of  fish fingers for £.Some how they manage to fit it all in their two chest freezers and a fridge freezer.We get frozen food mainly because it is cheaper and more convenient, Bethan said. It is what they want.The family go through three big boxes of washing powder every month.With two washing machines and two dryers, there is washing on all the time and, with two bathrooms, Bethan can wash three of the children at a time in the shower downstairs.Time flies and before you know it is bed time again, she said. After dinner, they just play - there are toys everywhere.I try to get them to sleep by pm or pm. I am up until midnight or am doing things around the house.There are little breaks for the family as they never go on holidays, partly because Mark doesnt like it.If we go anywhere, we go somewhere for the day - normally Porthcawl, Bethan said. But it takes a lot of planning.It is hard work to have that many children, but they are happy and they are very close to each other.I am happy I got sterilised but I do not regret anything.The mum-of- said she worked full-time in a café until she had Mark  years ago.She quit her job to look after him and now relies on benefits to live. With £ coming in every two weeks, the benefits they receive include income support and child benefit, as well as disability allowance.It is not enough. I could take them all to town and spend £ just on shoes for all of them. We do not have any savings - all we have goes on them.

Henry McMaster and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp both announced mandatory evacuation orders to take effect at noon Monday.The South Carolina order covers all of Beaufort and Charleston counties and parts of the rest of the states coastal counties, which state officials estimated covered , people.The Georgia order covers people who live east of Interstate  in the counties along the Atlantic coast that includes Savannah and most of its , residents.Mandatory evacuation orders in Florida are for low-lying and flood-prone areas and mobile homes.These take effect starting either Sunday or Monday from Palm Beach County north to at least the Daytona Beach area.More than  Labor Day flights in the US have been cancelled, many of them in Florida as Hurricane Dorian barrels toward the state’s coast.Officials have blasted social media idiots after videos appeared online of daredevils riding into the storm on inflatable boats in mph winds.One man filmed himself in the rain, just  miles from the eye of the hurricane, while another is seen trying to navigate a small boat in choppy waters, both in the Bahamas.The National Hurricane Center tweeted a warning about the danger of the storm last night.They said: IMPORTANT: We have seen videos in the Abacos of people venturing out in the eye of #Dorian. Everyone should take shelter immediately as winds will increase rapidly and unpredictably after the eye passes.Others posted videos showing homes missing parts of their roofs, downed power lines and smashed and overturned cars.Hundreds of residents on the island of Grand Bahamas have already fled from its predicted path amid official warnings the storm surge could be le-threatening and as high as ft in places.And the pummelling is expected to last for hours as the hurricane may slow to just one mph prolonging its catastrophic effects, the NHC said.Dorian has also grown larger in size, with hurricane-force winds currently extending  miles from the storms centre and  is now the second strongest hurricane on modern record in the region.With winds at  mph, Dorian ties with Gilbert , Wilma . Only Allen in  was more powerful with mph winds.Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis begged residents of Abaco and Grand Bahamas to head for the main island to escape the devastating, dangerous storm.I want you to remember: homes, houses, structures can be replaced. Lives cannot be replaced, he said.He added that , people and , homes were at risk to storm surges.Still, dozens of people ignored evacuation orders, officials said, and they were warned that they were placing their lives in danger.  Silbert Mills, owner of the Bahamas Christian Network, said trees and power lines were torn down in The Abaco Islands and some roads were impassable.The winds are howling like weve never, ever experienced before, said Mills, , who planned to ride out the hurricane with his family in the concrete home he built  years ago in central Abaco.This is a le-threatening situation, the NHC warned. Residents there should take immediate shelter. Do not venture into the eyeit passes over your location.The eye of the storm - now at the highest possible category - is expected to lay waste to the Abaco Islands before barrelling northwards to Florida and Georgia.Even a glancing blow from one of the strongest storms ever to menace Florida could bring torrential rains and damaging winds.On Great Guana Cay, just off Great Abaco Island, waves began washing over low-lying parts of the tiny nine-mile strand of land.Although some residents left for Nassau and where days ago, some  to  are riding out the storm on the island.US President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that the storm would likely impact the eastern seaboard from Florida to North Carolina.Mr Trump later tweeted: Pray for the people in the Bahamas. Being hit like never before, Category . Almost  MPH winds.According to tracking site FlightAware,  flights to, from or within America were cancelled on Saturday.And as of this morning another  planes were grounded for US trips scheduled for Sunday.The site said: “We expect these numbers to increase in the upcoming days, especially at airports in the region where Dorian is to make landfall.”Airlines have been issuing waivers to customers for several days for journeys which are heading to destinations in the hurricane’s path, reports CNN.While travel firms have issued advisories to cities in Florida, Georgia and the Caribbean – more waiver options will be issued for the Carolinas as the massive storm moves northwards up the east coast.Radar shows the eye of Hurricane Dorian during a reconnaissance mission over the Atlantic OceanOperations at Orlando International Airport will be suspended at am Monday local time, according to an official statement.Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale International Airport have yet to confirm what action they will take and are monitoring the hurricane’s path, it has been reported.The storm is predicted to take the same route as Category  Matthew took three years ago – hugging the southern east coast of the country while still causing billions of dollars of damage.The killer hurricane devastated the four states bringing wind and flood damage, killing  and leaving millions without power.But Bryan Norcross, a senior hurricane specialist, told Florida Today that Dorian is moving even slower than Matthew which means it could wreak more havoc on the sunshine state.He said: “As it stands right now, coastal Florida has got to be ready for storm surge exceeding Matthew. And higher winds than Matthew. And heavier rain than Matthew.The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is based on a hurricanes sustained wind speed.Just be ready for that. We’re in a position where you’re talking three, four, five days in advance of what you have to be ready for.“The threat is real from the Treasure Coast throughout the Florida peninsula. The trend is somewhat favourable — though the danger is still high along the immediate coastline.”The devastation caused by Dorian could be made worse by exceptionally strong tides called King Tide -which makes coastal areas more vulnerable to flooding.The super-strength tide happens around the time as a full moon or new moon and this year the King Tides have already flooded neighbourhoods in Miami - and the most recent full moon was yesterday.The storms winds reached mph today - just mph shy of becoming a Category  hurricane.Winds are currently raging over the warm Atlantic waters and is inching towards the northwestern Bahamas, according to the US National Hurricane Center.The centre says the storms path is still unpredictable, but Georgia and the Carolinas are now at risk of strong winds and le-threatening storm surge.They said: It should be noted that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty.Supermarket shelves have been left bare as residents scramble to prepare for the Category  storm.Sunday: Dorians hurricane siege will begin in the northwest Bahamas as it continues to slow down. Tropical storm-force winds may begin to arrive in parts of Florida. Large swells should begin to arrive at the coast from North Carolina to Florida.Monday: Dorian may still be hammering the northwest Bahamas as it crawls slowly. Bands of rain, strong winds may affect parts of Florida. How strong the winds will be depends on how close the center of Dorian is to the Florida coast, which is uncertain at this time.Tuesday-Thursday: Dorian is expected to move north, then northeast near the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.

on, he said.Volunteers first found the mosaic two years ago, but it was recovered to allow farmers to continue using the field.The dig to fully excavate it took only ten days.Explaining the story depicted, Anthony Beeson, an expert on Greek and Roman architecture, said: The pavement shows Bellerophon and Pegasus but the main action is the story of Pelops and his race to win the hand of the Princess Hippodamia.The king, Oenomaus, having been told that his future son-in-law would bring about his death, made all contestants race him in a chariot but handicapped them by putting the princess in the vehicle with them.The losers were decapitated and their heads displayed.Pelops persuaded a former lover Myrtilus and the Kings chariot master to substitute a wax lynch pin and the king was killed when the wheels flew off.Pelops thereby won but killed Myrtilus who cursed his lineage and brought about the curse of the Pelops.The kings funerary games are said to be the origin of the Olympics.He ed the following year with , soldiers, winning a number of battles and forcing key tribal leaders to surrender, but were forced to withdraw later the same year to deal with problems in Gaul.In AD, a Roman force led by Aulus Plautius landed in Kent and took the south east.The emperor Claudius later arrived with reinforcements before appointing Plautius governor of Britain and ing to Rome.Four years later, Londondium, which was to become modern-day London, was founded, and Britain was delcared part of the Roman Empire.The Romans spent the next  years working their way north, winning battles against a series of tribes and suppressing rebellions.They also built around , miles of paved roads to allow the rapid movement of troops and military supplies, later to be used in commerce and the transportation of goods.The routes of many of those roads still form part of Britains national road network today.In AD, Hadrians Wall was built to guard against repetaed rebellions from Scotland.By AD, Romans were becoming the subject of sustained attacks by barbarian tribes, and soldiers in the country began being recalled to Rome.In AD, all Romans in Britain were recalled by the Emperor Honorious, and just  years later, in AD, the Roman Empire collapsed.The mosaic will now be covered again to protect it and to allow farmers to go on using the field.Hopes that the mosaic could be removed and put in a museum have also been scuppered.Boxford Heritage Project chairwoman Joy Appleton said: We have been told that there is no point removing it because it is too big for museums.The local community want to keep the mosaic where it is.It would cost millions to open it up.She added that nearly , people had shown up to an open viewing held for members of the public on

­damage on the same British constitution and wreck public trust in Parliamentary ­democracy.It was Parliament whose MPs voted overwhelmingly for an In-Out referendum.It was Parliament that voted for every step towards Brexit along the way.It was Parliament that three times rejected the only EU deal on offer.And it was in Parliament, as Foreign Secretary in , that Phil Hammond lectured MPs on the

ministers or ­parliamentarians in this ­chamber. The decision must be for the common sense of the British people.”That decision was duly taken in the biggest single-issue democratic vote in British history.Hammond has been fighting ever since to turn it on its head.This is the real constitutional outrage.

Labouraposs leader reiterated his long-standing calls for a snap poll in a slapdown to Tony Blair , who warned it would be an elephant trap.Askedhe backed an election under any circumstances, Mr Corbyn said: We want a general election so the people of this country can decide their future. Asked a second time by Sky News off-camera, he replied: Of course, we are the opposition party, we want a general election.

But you have got to look at the polling. I mean, look. Whereaposs Labour in the polls  Some are in the twenties. When I was leader of the oppositionweaposd been polling in the twenties, there would have been a few people knocking on my door and not wanting to have a very polite conversation.

But Mr Corbyn today reiterated his long-standing calls for an election - when askedhe would back one under any circumstance, at any time.  He replied: We will do everything we can to stop a no deal exit from the EU. that is our priority. A vote of no confidence is very much there on the table. Itaposs not an aposeither orapos, both options are absolutely there. And we will do everything we can in the coming weeks to prevent a no-deal. We want a general election so the people of this country can decide their future. And weaposre very clear that we would, in the Labour manesto, include a public vote under a Labour government with the option of Remain or whatever alternative Parliament has come to. If itaposs no-deal, then we would vote to Remain. If itaposs any other deal, then our partyaposs democratic processes will decide what position we take.  Sky Newsapos reporter who asked the question, Kate McCann, tweeted that she approached Mr Corbyn after the press conference and asked him to claryhe backed an election under any circumstances. According to her, he replied: Of course, we are the opposition party, we want a general election. Labour sources said the account of the exchange was accurate. Mr Corbynaposs comment is not a change in Labouraposs position. But it comes at a crucial time ahead of a momentous week in Parliament that could start the clock ticking to a general election.

I dislike the poisonous language of treachery used by Tory and Brexit Party demagogues to shout down reasonable voices warning that tearing our country out of Europe would be as disastrous as Government experts privately predict. But examine who is prepared to hammer the economy and put a bomb under democracy by sidelining the very sovereign Parliament they pretended to champion, and it is Johnson, Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nigel Farage and the rest of the Brexit bandits.    Losing every fact-based argument and rational debate, these desperadoes can no longer pretend food and medicine shortages predicted after a no-deal Brexit are part of “Project Fear” when the dire leaked assessments come from within their regime. Mass protests and opinion polls repeatedly show that the public has snfed a fraud, and folk are now likely to back staying in as the truth dawns. That is why the charlatans are terried of a fresh referendum, clinging instead to an ageing, squeaked result sneaked by lies and criminality in another Parliament, three PMs ago. MPs must unite this week to save Parliament and Britain by ruling out egomaniac Johnson’s Halloween Horror. Vowing to call an early General Election to block MPs and trigger October ’s Brexit fright night is just another miscalculation by a slippery premier who is too clever by half. Naming an election date isn’t in his gt under a Fixed Term Parliament Act requiring a two-thirds vote by MPs or Jeremy Corbyn securing two weeks to form an alternative administration after winning a no-confidence vote in Johnson. Unite to fight back against Johnson and Labour, Libs, Green, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Tory rebels may yet turn the tables on the great hoodwinker.

But Leader of the Commons Mr Rees-Mogg snapped at the doctor, telling him he was a Remoaner who was fearmongering on public radio.

I think itaposs typical of Remainer campaigners and you should be quite ashamed, Iaposm afraid.Dr Nicholl has repeatedly voiced concerns about no-deal Brexit and threatened in March to stand against his local MP, Chancellor Sajid Javid , in an election. He spoke at a Change UK event and tweeted in May urging people to vote for the new anti-Brexit party. He attended a Peopleaposs Vote march in London, according to local reports, and spoke out in April to the BBC to criticise the policy of keeping no-deal documents secret. Separately, he was also involved in Amnestyaposs long-running campaign for the release of British citizen Shaker Aamer from Guantanamo Bay.His call comes three years after Michael Gove , now the no-deal Brexit planning chief, infamously said people in this country have had enough of experts. Dr Nicholl phoned LBC to tell Mr Rees-Mogg: I was actually involved in Yellowhammer and drafting the plans of mitigation for a no-deal Brexit in March. My question to you really, having being involved in writing the plans for mitigation and having whistleblown because I felt they were unsafe, is what level of mortality rate are you willing to accept in light of a no-deal Brexit  Mr Rees-Mogg replied: I donapost think there is any reason to suppose a no-deal Brexit should lead to a mortality rate. I think this is the worst excess of Project Fear. And Iaposm surprised that a doctor in your position would be fearmongering in this way on public radio. The doctor protested: I wrote the plans in mitigation. Visibly rattled, Mr Rees-Mogg snapped back :You didnapost write very good plansyou hadnapost worked out how to mitigate, had you  Itaposs fortunate they are being written by other people now who are serious about mitigating rather than Remoaners.

But there was a time before the fanfare when -year-old Meghan took trips abroad for nothing but rest and relaxation - sharing her experiences with her Instagram followers. Before meeting her future husband and having baby Archie, she explored some of Europeaposs most stunning spots.Ibiza   As part of her travels, Meghan took time out to chill in Ibiza. Known as the ultimate party island, Meghan looked less rave-ready and more poolside chic as she took a dip to cool off. The Duchess is said to be a huge fan of Ibiza, and celebrated her th birthday at a luxurious villa on the island with Prince Harry earlier this year. Boasting seven-bedrooms, a gym, a jacuzzi and its own  metre infinity pool - the sprawling pad is said to have cost £, a week to rent.    The villa lies close to the picturesque village of Es Cubells on the south-western coast of Ibiza. A description on a luxury villa rental website reads: Sa Calma in an amazing exclusive front line villa with direct access to the sea. The royals flew in their own entourage when they arrived by private jet, according to the Mail on Sunday. Madrid, Spain    Meghan wandered the streets of Madrid as part of her European adventure. She shared a picture of her looking Insta-perfect for her fans, standing alongside Markus Anderson, a consultant for Soho House Group, and fashion designer, Misha Nonoo. Nonoo has a royal connection of her own as her brother-in-law, Charlie Gilkes, was a classmate of Prince William’s at Eton. While in the Spanish capital, Markle is said to have checked out the Museo Prado, ate plenty of tapas and danced in the streets. Earlier this year it was revealed Meghan Markleaposs lookalike was running to be Mayor of Madrid. Begoña Villacis, , was widely compared to the Duchess throughout her electoral campaign not only for her similar looks but also for her strikingly similar outfits. She also gave birth less than two weeks after Meghan. Capri, Italy    Next on Meghanaposs month of wanderlust came Capri, in Italy.  The island in the Bay of Naples is known for its rugged landscape, upmarket hotels and shopping. While itaposs likely Meghan and pals hit some of the designer shops, the actress also reportedly watched an episode of Suits in Italian. Pictured yet again in her trusty holiday hat, Meghan shared an image of her relaxing on a veranda with stylist friend Jessica Mulroney. The two met when Meghan was filming Suits As a stylist, Mulroney helped up Meghan’s wardrobe game, a mutual friend explained to the Express . They said: Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Positano, Italy    Moving up the Amalfi coast, Meghan and her gal pals headed to Positano. The stunning clfside village on southern Italyaposs Amalfi Coast is famed for its incredible vistas - and is very Instagram-worthy. Meghan and friends checked into the La Sirenuse hotel - offering breathtaking views of the village and out to sea. The Duchess and Jessica Mulroney were said to have wined and dined on some of the best food and drink Positano has to offer - including meats, cheese and olives. The village is a popular holiday destination, overlooking a pebble beach with beautul cafes and restaurants. Other celebrities to have visited the village include Gwyneth Paltrow, Emily Ratajkowski and Karlie Kloss. Hydra, Greece    Meghan shared another stunning image from her month-long trip after touching down in Greece. The Duchess visited Hydra, one of the Saronic Islands, for low-key bachelorette party for one of her best friends, Lindsay Roth. Meghan travelled around the island on foot and bike - once saying on her blog, The Tig, that apostheres not much to do, which is the whole pointapos. As part of the bachelorette party, Meghan organised for the two of them, along with their other pal Lucy, to take some time out on the island to sunbathe, eat and drink. Writing on The Tig, Meghan said: When my best friend, Lindsay , announced she and her beau would be tying the knot, the pressure I felt as maid of honor was immense.

Then there is the stationary, the PE kit and the natural worries about them making new friends. But a minority of mums and dads panic over whether their precious little ones will even make it to the safety of hometime. Clare Hussein says every school day she struggles with the worry that she may never see her child alive again. Her nine-year-old daughter has been battling le-threatening allergies all her le. She is currently diagnosed with  conditions that could cause her to have an anaphylactic shock, stop breathing and die at any time. She is allergic to ying substances, from nuts and milk to tomatoes and dust. And so when Clare packs her off with a medical kit - containing two adrenaline auto-injectors and instructions for staff - her heart is in her mouth. The -year-old mum, from Portsmouth, said: We are handing the control over to someone , who hasnapost lived with it, presumably they havenapost seen a severe reaction and they have  children to look after.Have you got a back to school story  Email webnews@mirror   Clare says a constant barrage of questions consume her mind - will the teacher understand what might happen  Are they prepared  Have I given then enough information  What about lunchtime - who serves the food, is it safe  Will the dinner ladies understand and know what symptoms to look our for  Can they do this with many other children to take care of too  Are they close enough to the emergency medication  Do they know how to use it  And the list goes on. The mum added: No day goes by without wondering, worrying and double guessing yourself. Sending your child off to school for the first time feels like the scariest thing in the world. Not because they might be upset or scared, although that is also a worry, but because they have le threatening allergies and handing over the care of your child to another person is fraught with anxiety.    She continued: Any day you wave them off could be the last time you see them. There are so many dangers to a child with severe allergies, at any point something could go wrong and the consequences can be a hospital visit or worse. Clare, who works part time while studying for a degree in Childhood, Youth Studies and Psychology at Portsmouth University, says she tries hard to create a balance for her little girl. I canapost ever be in a situation where I donapost have a phone, she said. The chance is small, but itaposs always there. And it is constant round of aposwhat sapos. Clare says her daughter is now learning to check labels but manufactures often change ingredients or factory conditions, turning once safe safe products into a danger.

A thousand miles away from the capital Nuuk, they have survived in this remote corner by following ancient ways of le, using kayaks and harpoons to hunt narwhal in the summer and travelling by ­dog sled in the winter. But this unique way of le now faces an unprecedented threat – global warming. I spent a week living in this community in August to understand their precarious existence.    Many have relatives in the Canadian Arctic, where the Inughuit ­originate. Previously it was possible to travel across the Smith Soundon dog sled, but it’s now impossible as the sea ice disappears. The only option is to fly to ­Copenhagen, almost ,km away, and then to cross the Atlantic to Montreal – a journey few can afford.

Ice stations have scientists from every G nation. The island’s ice sheet covers % of the land, km thick in places, and holds % of the world’s entire fresh water. The Jakobshavn glacier near Ilulissat – believed to be responsible for the iceberg that sank the Titanic – is so colossal that it alone has raised global sea levels by mm. It conveys more meltwater into the Atlantic in a day than London and New York use in a year.

Abdul Choudhury, his we and their four children, from Etruria in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, had booked a one-week holiday to Milan to visit relatives they hadnapost seen for  years. But they were forced to scrap their trip after a National Express coach got them to Manchester Airport almost two hours late. They desperately sprinted to their boarding gate but by the time they got there were told their plane had already left. Now Abdul, who has been left £. out of pocket, wants the company to refund the cost of his flight, reports Stoke-on-Trent Live. Have you had a holiday from hell  Email webnews@mirror    Recalling the nightmare ordeal, he said: It was a very stressful day, my we was really upset and so were the children. They were falling on the floor crying because they were really excited. We were meeting with relatives who we hadnapost seen for  years and we had to let them down as well. The kids are going back to school now so that was our last chance to visit them. The coach had been scheduled to leave Hanley bus station at .pm and arrive at the airport at .pm - two-and-a-half hours before the familyaposs flight at pm. However, it didnapost leave until .pm. The family were dropped off at Terminal  at .pm - a -minute walk away from Terminal .  The family made it through security but as they ran to their gate they were told the Ryanair flight had left without them. Abdul was offered alternative flights at a cost of £, but this was not an option so the family got the train home and missed their one-week break. National Express has offered to refund their coach and rail travel on the day - but -year-old Abdul believes they should also refund the £. cost of his flights. Abdul said: We got to the bus station at pm for the .pm coach. It got to about .pm and then the time on the board changed to .pm.   I went to the counter to ask what had happened and they said it was delayed in Birmingham. I told them that I had a flight at pm but they just said they didnapost know what was happening because they werenapost from National Express.  So we decided to wait becausethe coach got there for .pm we would still get to the airport at .pm, but it didnapost arrive until .pm. I explained to the driver that weaposd got a flight at pm and he told us not to worry and started driving. But it was rush-hour and it took us  minutes to pass Basford roundabout. When we got to Terminal  we had to run for  minutes like we were in a marathon with four children and our bags. When we got to our gate they said our flight had gone.  We then had to get the train home to Stoke-on-Trent and we didnapost get back until .pm. Abdul added: National Express says it is willing to refund the coach and train travel, but not the money for our fights. But we missed the flight because of them and it needs to be responsible for it. National Express had my email address and phone number so could have easily text me to let us know the coach was running late so we could arrange alternative transport but when the time had changed to .pm it was already too late. It was a traumatic experience for us. Iaposll never use National Express again for the airport.

The trio enjoyed video nights at Kensington Palace and Diana was determined her young sons would follow in her footsteps when it came to championing charitable causes. In a moving interview with Martin Bashir she stressed she wanted them to have an understanding of peopleaposs emotions, peopleaposs insecurities, peopleaposs distress, and peopleaposs hopes and dreams. The two princes are often compared to their caring mother with their charity work and the way they deal with members of the public. And Diana made sure they were aware how fortunate they were from an early age.    She said: I take them round homelessness projects, Iaposve taken William and Harry to people dying of Aids - albeit I told them it was cancer - Iaposve taken the children to all sorts of areas where Iaposm not sure anyone of that age in this family has been before. And they have a knowledge - they may never use it, but the seed is there, and I hope it will grow because knowledge is power. But when William was just  and his younger brother, Harry, was just , their world fell apart when their beloved mum was killed in a car accident in Paris on August , . Her sons were on holiday with their father, Prince Charles, at Balmoral when the call came through about the tragedy. Charles was the first person to be told, in a phone call, about his ex-weaposs death.    Stunned, he informed the Queen, and the two of them tried to come up with a way of shielding the two young princes from the worst of the tragedy. But Harry was determined to fulfil one final wish for his beloved mother - he wanted to travel to Paris with his father to collect her body. Charles, desperate to protect his young son, refused the request, and instead travelled alone to bring Dianaaposs body back to Britain. Journalist and friend of Diana, Richard Kay said: The Queen and Prince Charlesapos view was that the boys were their main priority. However, Charlesapos decision to travel with Dianaaposs body himself caused a huge rt with his mother, the Queen.    Richard said: Charles took the decision that he was going to Paris to bring back Dianaaposs body. This was a surprising and brave move. He was an ex-husband, he had no right to be there other than as the father of her sons. Charles wanted to take the royal flight to Paris but the Queen wouldnapost allow it. Charles fought harder for Diana than he had ever fought for her in her letime. The Prince of Wales refused to back down and eventually the Queen agreed to allow him to fly on the royal plane to bring his ex-weaposs body back to Britain.    Following Dianaaposs death, Harry has admitted his struggles with grief. It inspired him to set up mental health initiatives to encourage other people to open up about their feelings. He has said he regrets not opening up sooner about the death of his mother. In a powerful documentary last year Harry said he refused to accept his mother was gone. He also praised Prince Charles for always being there for him following Dianaaposs death.    Harry said about his initial reaction to being told, while at Balmoral, that his mother was dead: “Disbelief, refused to accept it. “There was no sort of sudden outpour of grief.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen always orders same takeaway","story":"NewsQueen always orders same takeaway in Balmoral - and its not very royalHer Majesty heads to Balmoral each summer and a royal source said she always orders fish and chips on special occasionsShareCommentsByBrendan McFadden:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video queen-greeted-royal-regiment-scotland-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Earlier this week a fresh picture emerged of the Duke of York, now , partying alongside the disgraced financier and US President Donald Trump. Epstein killed himself on August  in a New York jail while awaiting trial on fresh charges of sex trafficking. The matter is weighing heavily on The Queen, sources told the Sunday Times.  A day after Epsteinaposs death, she was pictured attending church with a laughing Prince Andrew in a show of defiance. An insider reportedly said: The Epstein affair is bringing a more lasting whf of scandal to the monarchy. Another said: You’ve got a serious crime linked to the kind of behaviour towards women that people feel particularly strongly about at the moment. Andrewaposs association with [Epstein] is deeply damaging and he needs to deal with it.” According to The Sun, the Queen will be concerned and distressed  about the ongoing story.

It took place just months before Andrew’s accuser, Virginia Roberts, began working at the club as a changing room assistant. Within a year of the snap being taken she alleges disgraced Epstein had lent her out to sleep with the prince.

Rowlingaposs Harry Potter series from the school library. This is because the schoolaposs pastor has removed all seven of the magical books from library shelves, after taking issue with their portrayal of magic.According to an email sent to the parents of students, The Reverend Dan Reehill made the controversial decision after consulting with several exorcists in the US and Rome. They concluded that the spells and curses described in the book are real and risk conjuring evil spirits when read aloud.   The incredibly popular book series follows titular character Harry Potter as he discovers he is a wizard and goes off to learn magic at Hogwarts school.Along the way, he and his closest friends, Ron and Hermione, often face great danger and have to make potions and cast a number of dferent spells and charms to save the day.And while many of the characters use their magic for good, Reverend Reehill believes itaposs all a clever deception, reports The Tennessean.Writing in his email, he explained: These books present magic as both good and evil, which it not true, but is in fact a clever deception. The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.    Rebecca Hammel, the superintendent of schools for the Catholic Diocese of Nashville, confirmed that the Reverend had sent out this email and that he has the final say on the matter.She continued to say that the Catholic Church does not have an official position on the best-selling books.Each pastor has a canonical authority to make such decision for his parish school, she added. Heaposs well within his authority to act in that matter. However she did state that the school would not stop children from reading Harry Pottertheir parents gave them permission. She said: Should parents deem that this or any other media be appropriate we would hope that they would just guide their sons and daughters to understand the content through the lens of our faith.

Investigators who want to interview Frenchman Jean-Luc Brunel, , say he is a “ghost who has disappeared without trace”. It is understood enquires are being made in Brazil, the US and Europe. French prosecutors have opened their own inquiry into the crimes of American financier Epstein, . The convicted paedophile, a friend of Prince Andrew, committed suicide in jail on August  while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. Brunel, who helped found the New York model agency MC and is credited with finding supermodels such as Christy Turlington, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.    It was claimed Russian ex-model Svetlana Pozhidaeva, who was signed to MC, was pictured at Epstein’s New York mansion in . Ms Pozhidaeva, the daughter of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Red Army, has denied it is her in the photo. A day before it was taken, Prince Andrew was photographed standing in the doorway of Epstein’s home. One of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts, has alleged she slept with the Duke of York three times, which he has strongly denied. He has also denied knowing anything about Epstein’s illegal activities.    Roberts also claimed to have slept with Brunel “many times” when she was aged  to . Many of the girls said to have been used by Epstein were allegedly “sourced” in Paris, where the American owned a £million apartment. Brunel, who also lived in the city, was known to be scouring Brazil for new talent until early this summer. French prosecutors this month opened a preliminary inquiry into whether Epstein sexually abused French minors. Authorities say it is “urgent” Brunel is interviewed.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now.

There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

with a close range effort.Ross County twice hit the woodwork, once from the penalty spot.Aberdeen made four changes to the side that stuttered to a dire - stalemate with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park last weekend.Two were enforced with Scott McKenna and Shaleum Logan both ruled out through injury.Centre-back McKenna is out for up to a month with a hamstring tear suffered on the articial surface at Rugby Park.Right-back Logan was ruled out having undergone a minor procedure on a groin problem.It meant Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes had only four fit defenders available # with no defensive back up on the bench.However they secured a clean sheet.Wingers Ryan Hedges and Niall McGinn both ed to the starting line-up with James Wilson and Jon Gallagher dropping to the bench.Aberdeen began with attacking intent and forced two corners inside the opening two minutes but both came to nothing.The Reds should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when Ryan Hedges played a quick free quick to release Niall McGinn on the right flank.McGinn#ss low cross was palmed out by keeper Ross Laidlaw as far as Sam Cosgrove who capitalized to shoot low from  yards only to have his shot cleared off the line by Keith Watson.Aberdeen spurned another glorious opportunity in the th minute when Greg Leigh broke down the left and squared a pass into the penalty area but with the goal beckoning McGinn lted it high over the bar from  yards.In the rd minute Ferguson curled a free kick from the left into the box which Mikey Devlin met but his  yard glancing header flew wide.The Dons two game Premiership goal drought ended in the th minute with a set piece straight off the training ground.Rather than fire a free kick  yards out directly into the penalty area McGinn slid it wide to the unmarked Hedges on the right who immediately whipped in a curling cross that found LEIGH.The left-back powered home a  yard header beyond keeper Laidlaw.Aberdeen doubled their advantage two minutes later when Ferguson was clumsily brought down in the box by keeper Laidlaw.Leading scorer COSGROVE comfortably converted to the keeper#s left hand side for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen made it # in the th minute when McGinn cut inside on the left and delivered a superb cross towards the back post and HEDGES raced from the right to slide it in from close range.A minute later Ross County were awarded a penalty by referee Nick Walsh when a powerful drive from Stewart hit Funso Ojo#s hand from close range.Ojo was booked. Staggies failed to capitalize as Billy McKay#s spot kick rattled Joe Leiws# right hand post.Aberdeen continued to threaten when McGinn shot over the bar then minutes later Cosgrove had an effort saved by keeper Laidlaw.In the th minute Stewart broke in on goal and unleashed a curling shot that cracked off the far post from  yards.

It shows what can be done when we are more positive with our possession and positive with our runs and forward play.“Last week we talked a lot about the lack of intent and lack of quality and movement in the forward areas.“We got that this time and also got that quality and the goals.“We had a front three pulling and running the back lot of Ross County.“We had two very strong running performances fromBryson andFerguson in the middle of the park making good runs beyond and supporting.“Our full-backs also got up high and did well.“The intent from everybody to go and get that first goal and impose ourselves on the game was there.“I was delighted for my players and they deserve a lot of credit.”After a recent scoring drought McInnes hailed his team for refusing to let spurned chances frustrate them.The opener eventually came when Greg Leigh headed home.Cosgrove netted the second from the penalty spot moments later for his th goal of the season to put the Dons - up at half-time.Welsh international Ryan Hedges scored the third.McInnes said: “We passed up one or two good opportunities to get the first goal.“After that the players could have thought that it was not going to happen.“They could easily have let their heads go down but they stuck to their task.“They really kept at it to get the three points, and to send the supporters home happy.”Referee Nick Walsh awarded both sides a penalty and McInnes believes both decisions were the right call.Aberdeen’s spot-kick came in the first half when Ross County keeper Ross Laidlaw clumsily brought down Lewis Ferguson.Cosgrove converted to make it  goals in  starts.The Staggies were also awarded a penalty in the second half when a shot from Ross Stewart hit Funso Ojo’s hand.Belgian international Ojo was also yellow carded for the handball. Billy McKay hit the post with the spot-kick.McInnes accepts by the letter of the law according to the new Fa rules for this season it was a penalty.However, he was frustrated that the Dons were denied a spot-kick for an identical incident in the - loss to St Mirren in Paisley.In that match a shot from Hedges hit the arm of the Buddies’ Ryan Flynn.McInnes said: “Our penalty was a penalty.“Their’s, by the letter of the law, was a penalty as well.“I expected the referee to give a penalty and can have no complaints.“I was just angry at my own team for allowing the ball to travel into the box.“Maybe last season it wouldn’t have been a penalty but this season we all know it is more likely to be given.“That is why I was annoyed at St Mirren when we didn’t get a penalty for a handball.“But I think the referee this time got both right.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d668a497e6b59.78887505-651x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet harley basil and dexter and dakota are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This cheeky girl is  months old.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

It will reopen in spring .The closure plan was greeted with dismay in Campbeltown, with board members attacking the #scandalous# plan # with a promise to fight the #tooth and nail#.Chairman Allan McKie told The Courier this week that the move was finalised last Friday.#The decision was taken as the coreof the office is being moved to Oban,# Mr McKie said.#Membership was being handled in Campbeltown for the whole board area, and there is far bigger back-up in Oban. It was not a financial decision # it was an administrative one.#Pressed on whether he thought the closure would have an adverse effect on tourism, Mr McKie said: #I don#t think Campbeltown will suffer at all.#He continued: #In winter months, it was totally unrealistic to stay open and serve tourists, for all that there are. It is unfortunate. We took a long time to come to this decision and it is highly regrettable.#FIFTY YEARS AGORoad bridge row comes to an endThe #dry bridge# at Bridgend, Islay is to be raised to give clearance of ft ins.This was announced at the meeting of the Islay District Council on Monday.The total cost of the improvements will be borne by Western Ferries and several of the island#s distillery companies. Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour.

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10345671.jpg?type=article-full","title":"celebrate-tastes-scotland-scottish-food-drink-fortnight","story":"AldomakAldomak are a Scottish confectionery business established in  in Glasgow, supplying the ice cream trade.They manufacture Scottish Tablet, Fudge and Macaroon for a wide array of independents, supermarkets and the tourist trade, and have also branched out into making Handmade Meringues on a large scale, supplying farm shops, delis, hotels and cafes across Scotland.Aldomak are proud of their handmade artisanal credentials and over the years have spent time reimaging traditional recipes and scaling these recipes into large batches, whereby the confectioners pour and cut these by hand, to retain rustic products their customers love.They have also brought two of their own brands to the market, Confectious and Bonnie Glen which was a huge investment for the business.With Aldomak recently being awarded two  stars in the prestigious Great Taste Awards for their Bonnie Glen Vanilla Fudge and Butter Tablet, this validates the quality of their confectionery.Aldomakrsquos MD Dario Riccomini is clearly delighted with how things are going, stating that  has been a good year for the company in raising the profile of the business.

Why not have an everyday product with the best ingredients The pork meat is available all year round giving customers a steady supply of their staple shopping and this is then boosted with seasonal lamb, game and beef. When theygo to the markets people just love the story of the farm and that theycan basically point to the field where the animals are being reared.The flavours and dferent products have been created in collaboration with thelocal butcher and theirrange of wild venison is sourced from local estates, shot by a member of the Scottish Deer Society.Springfield Game and Country Meatsare looking to develop flavours without detracting from the flavour of the meat and product, you donrsquot need to hide quality. Theyare both genuinely surprised about how quickly the brand has taken off and how popular the products have become.

At that time The Diary, or as everyone knew it, Tom Shields Diary, appeared in the Herald twice a week and was eagerly anticipated by readers. Harry had a plan to increase this to five days a week, although critics argued that it would be too much of a good thing and would be killing the goose that laid the golden egg.I, though, had had my fill of writing about politics, the death of Scottish industry, and murder trials. Goodness, I had even been a witness in one murder trial where I shared a witness room with enough Glasgow so-called Godfathers to fill a Mario Puzo novel. I was happy to sign up as goose killer.It was only when I mentioned it to colleagues later in The Press Bar and one of them asked about my pay rise that I realised I had not thought to ask for one. I raced back upstairs and collared managing editor Bob Jeffrey and mentioned I had taken a job without discussing money. He shook his head and said he would see what he could do. Editors shaking their heads has been a regular mot in my career.Dferent times, of course. I reckon I was the last Herald reporter to claim for a dinner suit on expenses as invitations to awards events at hotels such as the Albany, the Hilton and whatever The Thistle hotel was called that week, rained in on us. It was a younger mans game then. Drinks in the bar went on into the small hours. I was once walking home down Byres Road in my dinner suit at seven in the morning thinking it was an odd way to earn a living.But as I say, I wasnt always a dilettante. \"One of my boulediers\" as editor Arnold Kemp once described me, not unkindly I hoped. I had moved in my early twenties from weekly newspapers to the Evening Times newsroom where typewriters were still used, copy takers took your calls from the office radio car, and you were in deadly competition to file your story before the Evening Citizen.No mobile phones, of course, and in areas where phone boxes were merely stench-filled public toilets with broken handsets, you would knock on someones door, announce you were a member of Her Majestys Press, and a wee wey would graciously allow you to use her phone, planked on a table in the hall. If you were lucky she would even go away and make you a cup of tea while you were phoning. We had a better reputation back then.:Ken Smiths Diary: Takes the biscuit Gee whizz Paws for thoughtThere was no internet to glean information. Instead, you would chap doors, stop folk in the street, and quiz imbibers in local boozers. Back at the Albion Street office you would then take your break next door in The Press Bar. It was originally the Express Bar, but when the Express pulled out of Glasgow, owner Tom McEntee simply got a ladder out and unscrewed the E and the X. Not just a pub though. Cheques were cashed there in the days before ATMs, money was even borrowed, and advice was given by fellow journalists with much more experience. I once asked Des McEnteehe ever had to throw out a journalist for fighting. \"Just the one,\" he said. \"Magnus Magnusson.\" What  The mild-mannered gentleman of Mastermind fame  Yes indeed ndash but someone had insulted his we, a fellow journalist, and he had gamely thrown a punch before being guided out the door.I dont want to romanticise drinking ndash it took away too many colleagues at an early age ndash but many of the most colourful, outrageous, and yes regrettable, events in my le began with a drink in Toms as we then called it. I didnt get into a fight there but I do recall being sent to interview Billy Connolly before he caught the ferry to Rothesay to perform at a charity gig. Unbeknown to me, our Womens Editor had that day lambasted Billy in print for giving his daughters the odd names ndash well odd for Glasgow back then ndash of Scarlett and Daisy. When I introduced myself he blew up and threatened to throw me in the ClydeI followed him on the ferry. I scurried off and phoned my news editor who imperiously announced: \"The Evening Times will not be dictated to by a banjo player. Get on that ferry.\"Other stories were utterly bleak. I reported every day of the y Ice Cream Wars murder trial of TC Campbell and Joe Steele accused of killing six members of the Doyle family ndash a decent family targeted merely because a son drove an ice cream van. It was turning over the stone as the worst of Glasgow came crawling out.I then became an industrial reporter, met some of the most helpful, committed trade unionists around, but slowly realised I was overseeing the death of heavy industry in Scotland. It won me press awards as I went behind the employment numbers and reported on the human cost of jobs lost, families on poverty benefits, and workers left with little hope of working again.I once pursued the Caterpillar dispute shop stewards at a meeting off Clyde Street in Glasgow. I had to take them for a drink. Dark rum was the tipple. I eventually staggered out to sit slumped on a bench overlooking the Clyde, thinking I was about to throw up ndash dark rum is not a drink to be treated lightly. A passing jakie carrying a can of Special Brew was so concerned he stopped to askI was alright. Thats how glamorous it was at times. When the Ravenscraig workers marched to Downing Street my editor sent me with them, and of course I had to do my share of walking. I still have a statue of a foundry worker cast to mark the -day march on my desk. Lost a bit of weight mind you, which the hotel dinners later overcame.So I moved from the Evening Times to the then Glasgow Herald as I fancied the idea of using bigger words and longer sentences. I was mainly reporting still on industry but also on politics. There was a fresh-faced young leader of the SNP, an Alex Salmond, who talked of gaining power, but no one took him that seriously.And then came the move to the Diary to help Tom who eventually decided on his own move to other journalistic outlets. The paper had trundled from Albion Street to Cowcaddens, and using The Press Bar as a second office was no more. It was probably a good thing for my health. Fortunately David Belcher helped me with the Diary before he too left me to it.I was there on my own the day Sean Connery phoned from the Bahamas. He read the Diary online and he couldnt get the drt of one of the stories and could I please explain. The accent is so well-known I was looking around to seesomeone in the office was doing an impression. But no it was Sean. Didnt give me any stories though.And now it is my turn to leave and pass the Diary baton on. The dinner suit had its final journalistic outing at the Scottish Bar Awards at The Hilton last week. Fortunately I was tucked up at home well before seven in the morning. To Diary readers my heartfelt thanks in providing thousands of stories over the years. I didnt write the Diary, I was merely the conduit for the funny, observant and literate readers out there who took the time to fuel the column every day. I have a huge debt of gratitude.Before social media, readers expressed their criticism more in The Heralds letters pages. I still have the cutting when a reader wrote: \"Ken Smith in his Diary piece on Keir Hardie aims presumably at wit: what he achieves is smart-aleckry at its most crass.\" Thank you, dear readers, for putting up with my crass smart-aleckry over all these years, and play nice with the new boy.Kens last Diary will appear this Saturday. But never fear, Lorne Jackson, who has provided holiday cover for Ken, will be taking over.CAREER HIGHReceiving a press award from Princess Anne, although on reflection I think I went into a too detailed explanation of relative house prices when she simply asked meI had thought of moving to a London newspaper.CAREER LOWStanding in the falling snow outside a Springburn tenement on Christmas Day trying to interview a family about their son murdered on Christmas Eve while their menacing neighbour, quite rightly, threatened to batter me into the New YearI approached their door again.MOST IMPRESSIVE UNION OFFICIALJimmy Airlie, not Jimmy Reid, was actually the inspiring orator from the Clyde shipyard work-in days, and could hold a crowd in his hand with his powerful speeches, but Tommy Brennan, leader of the Ravenscraig workers, was a stand-out for his admirable integrity and ability to argue the steelworks case with quiet logic and determination.MOST IMPRESSIVE POLITICIANYou kidding  Well,pushed I would say John Smith: erudite, visionary and actually likeable.

Carlaw, the partyrsquos deputy leader, agreed to step up on an interim basis until the contest is called.It is understood that the key issue for the Scottish Tories over the next few months will be on whether the party should either split from the UK party or become more autonomous.Davidson won the leadership in  after defeating this proposal, which had been suggested by rival Murdo Fraser.However, senior party figures believe times have changed and a majority of Tory MSPs, as well as a big majority of shadow cabinet members, are said to back a rethink of the relationship with the UK party.Fraser and Adam Tomkins, the partyrsquos shadow constitution secretary, are on the record voicing their support for a revised structure. There is no preferred model, but advocates of change are attracted to setting up a new party purely for Holyrood elections.In comments reported yesterday, Carlaw shot down the idea of a debate.ldquoI just donrsquot think an introspective debate of that character is going to impress people when there are huge issues facing the country, he said.ldquoI do believe we have that independence to develop our own political agenda on devolved issues.

It is fundamentally not his place to make this decision as interim leader. He has been told he cannot make rulings on issues such as this.Supporters of changing the relationship with the UK party want an internal review to examine a range of options, rather than allowing the issue to dominate a leadership contest.The MSP continued: ldquoHaving a review before the contest makes a lot of sense. We are now in a situation where a majority of our parliamentarians in Scotland are willing to explore other models for the structure of the party, and it would be dficult to conduct that debate within the heat of a leadership contest.A second MSP said: ldquoI am in favour of having another structure and we should have a review or a commission report back before the contest.

Paul has been discussing, as have Lesley [Laird, MP] and others, future arrangements which the party will obviously be considering. An incoming Labour Government would not want, or welcome, or support an independence referendum in Scotland.Meanwhile, Corbyn also told the gathering that next week is the ldquolast chance to stop a no-deal Brexit.ldquoWe will do absolutely everything we can to prevent a no-deal Brexit and the Prime Minister taking us into the hands of Donald Trump and a trade deal with the USA.ldquoThat is the real agenda of the Prime Minister.

No-one seriously believes the Scottish Conservativesrsquo recent revival could have been possible without the working-class, kick-boxing lesbian ldquofae the Kingdom of Fe.Davidson breathed le into the moribund Tory party by confounding expectations. She was an exercise in confusion marketing the antithesis of the reactionary, middle-class, middle-aged, strait-laced Scottish Tory image. She talked straight, and she sometimes talked dirty.Her LGBT liberalism finally rescued Unionism from the old Rangers-supporting, Union Flag-waving, sectarian taint that dated from the days when the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party really was the Orange party.This rebranding took the Tories from the margins of politics to the main opposition in Holyrood in only three years.She then won  Westminster seats at the  General Election, more than the Democratic Unionist Party, Theresa Mayrsquos coalition partners. The likely loss of those Scottish seats at the next General Election could be crucial to the fate of the United Kingdom. It may not survive her.For First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the loss of her most dangerous foe caps her best-ever summer.Last month, the Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, came north to the Edinburgh Festival and, in a remarkable reversal of policy, announced that Labour would not stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum. Scottish Labourrsquos leader, Richard Leonard, doesnrsquot seem to have quite got the message.Boris Johnsonrsquos election as Conservative leader and Prime Ministerwas an even greater political windfall for Sturgeon. Of all the potential candidates for Number , the Bullingdon English nationalist was the best because he was the worst. The Tories havenrsquot had a leader so out of tune with Scottish sympathies since Margaret Thatcher. His very voice seems redolent of English public school elitism.Now, Johnsonrsquos reckless pursuit of a no-deal Brexit has served to remind Scots just why they voted overwhelmingly to Remain. In this weekrsquos Herald readersrsquo survey, support for Brexit is now down to %. Some % of Scots voted to leave the EU in the  referendum.His decision to prorogue Parliament allowed Sturgeon to announce that it was a ldquodark day for democracy and accuse him of exercising dictatorial powers. As Scotland is dragged kicking and screaming out of the Europe, power is being centralised in Westminster as never before. This has renewed the debate about the powers of the Scottish Parliament. If the PM is prepared to run roughshod over Westminster, how is he going to treat Holyrood in future Davidsonrsquos departure comes not a moment too soon for the First Minister. There has been grumbling among SNP activists on social media about the lack of progress to the next independence referendum. No-one believes that Johnson will agree to one, which makes Sturgeonrsquos promise of a referendum in the second half of  sound vacuous.Why wait, said the former SNP MP George Kerevan. She should withdraw MPs from Westminster, he tweeted, and ldquodeclare an independence referendum immediately REGARDLESS of Londonrsquos permission.He added that Gandhi and Mandela ldquodidnrsquot await permission to free themselves. Many thousands of independence supporters stand ready this weekend to join a campaign of civil disobedience in support of self-government. All Sturgeon needs to do is give the word, and they would be manning, and womanning, the barricades.But I donrsquot think the First Minister is going to go down an extra-parliamentary, unconstitutional route to independence. Recalling Holyrood is a possibility, though it would have to be for a specic purpose, not a unilateral declaration of independence. She certainly wonrsquot call an unlawful Catalan-style unauthorised referendum. Nor will she withdraw MPs from Westminster. She is not a risk-taking, insurgent leader.This doesnrsquot mean Nicola Sturgeon has given up on independence, or that the Union is saved. On the contrary, the events of the past week may have destroyed the last vestiges of support for the Union in Scotland, and made some form of constitutional orce inevitable. But Sturgeon is a cautious lawyer. She is unlikely even to request a referendum unless there is a signicant increase in support for independence in the opinion polls.Support for Yes is certainly edging up over % in some polls ndash but it is painfully slow. Most Scots tell pollsters that they expect Scotland to be independent some time in the future, but that doesnrsquot translate into a demand for a referendum today. The landscape of Brexit is just too confused. We canrsquot even be sure when or how, or even , the UK is leaving the European Union.The First Minister is a gradualist, and her sights will be set, first of all, on the next General Election. She wants those  seats that she lost in  ndash that really hurt. Then there is the possibility of a hung parliament and working in some form of confidence-and-supply arrangement with Labour. Now that there is agreement on indyref, a Corbyn coalition is eminently doable.If there is no General Election, orthe Tories win again, she will concentrate, I believe, on obliterating the Tories in Scotland in . She has really hated them being the main opposition party in Scotland and no doubt feels a personal sense of responsibility to see them back in their box. With Richard Leonard in dficulty, there is now no effective opposition to the SNP in Holyrood.She will put indyref high on the agenda for the  Scottish elections, and use that as a lever to get a Section  from Westminster for a legally binding referendum, perhaps in  ,  years after the first independence referendum. That may seem a long way off for her more ardent troops, but in the great scheme of things it is a blink of an aye.There is speculation that she might not lead that independence campaign. A number of nationalist insiders believe the First Minister could resign following revelations in the forthcoming Alex Salmond court case. But I think it unlikely that Sturgeon will be going off to spend more time with her family any time soon.Therersquos just too much going on. Her number one enemy is gone, Johnson is staying and there is Brexit chaos all round. The SNP is riding high in the polls fully  years since the party came to office. What more could any leader wish for  Family can wait."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-gove-accused-39-contempt-democracy-39-refusing-say-govt-abide-mps-39-vote-block-no-deal","story":"The warning from Labour came after Michael Gove refused to confirm the UK Government would abide by legislation blocking a no-deal Brexitit were forced through by Tory rebels and the Opposition.Ahead of what promises to be an historic parliamentary showdown this week, the Cabinet Office Minister knocked back fears of food shortages in a no-deal outcome but admitted that some food prices would increasethe UK crashed out of the EU without a deal on October .Pressed repeatedly on whether the Government would abide by a successful bid by Commons opponents to pass legislation preventing a no-deal withdrawal at Hallowersquoen, Mr Gove told BBC Ones The Andrew Marr Show: \"Lets see what the legislation says.

Any move to ignore an act of Parliament would be a full-blown attack on our constitution.\"It is staggering that in the same interview, Michael Gove admitted that the no-deal Brexit the Government is attempting to ram through will hit peoplersquos living standards with increased food prices.ldquoThis is a price that Boris Johnson is willing to pay because it wonrsquot be him and his wealthy friends paying it but ordinary families already struggling after nine years of austerity.Mr Trickett added: \"It is the people, not an unelected prime minister in hock to the vested interests of the richest, who should determine our countryrsquos future.\"Pete Wishart for the SNP said: \"The Tories are jumping up the dictatorial scale at an alarming rate, bounding from plans to suspend Parliament and now refusing to saythey will abide by the law.

Its no wonder the outrage and protests across the UK are growing larger all the time. The British people believe in democracy and fair play and the only way to resolve the Brexit crisis is to give them the final say.Meanwhile, David Gauke, the former Justice Secretary and a leading Tory rebel, made clear he would be prepared to give up the Conservative whip to block a no-deal in the national interest.He told Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ldquoIf it is the position now that defying the whip on a European vote is a matter that you lose the whip from the Conservative party, then there are quite a lot of Conservative MPs who over the recent months would have lost the whip.ldquoBut sometimes there is a point where you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest and the national interest has to come first. But I hope it doesnrsquot come to that. I hope cooler and calmer heads will look at this and think that trying to split the Conservative Party in this way is not a sensible way forward for the Conservative Party, or indeed for the country,\" he added.It has been suggested that as many as  Tory rebels are prepared to defy Mr Johnson and vote to block a no-deal outcome.On Monday, Mr Gauke and former Cabinet ministers are set to have their own private showdown with the PM in Downing St.\"I want to hear from him as to what is his plan to deliver a deal. When are we putting forward proposals to deal with this backstop issue  And I want to hear how he plans to deliver the legislationwe get a deal by October , because at the moment, frankly, I cant see how hes got time to do that,\" said Mr Gauke.Reports suggested that any Tory MP who defies the Government could see their candidacy withdrawn in the event of a snap general election.

I guess it makes a change from hunting seals.Much like the Orcas, the pelagic men are the big beasts of the fishing industry, catching and landing large volumes of high-value fish in vessels that they have invested scores of millions of pounds in to keep them safe in wild winter seas that have of the type that the history books tell us thcclaimed the lives of too many fishermen.But they know full well that, just as the Orca is no more important than the sand eel in the ecosystem, this does not make them better than the inshore fisherman who lives next door and makes his living from shellfish or jigging for cod or mackerel.Equally, the guys who go to sea to catch the white fish ndash cod, haddock, monkfish, megrim, hake ndash that you buy in your fishmonger feel neither superior nor inferior.That is because the industry has its own ecosystem, with all the parts dependent on each other toharmoniously.In Shetland, it is possible to witness this in action on a daily basis.From my office window in Lerwick Harbour I can see vans from a range of dferent marine and electrical engineering companies parked next to whitefish vessels while repairs and servicing work are carried out on board.Those same companies, which provide highly skilled employment of the sort that keeps young people in our community and lay the foundations for a strong future, support the pelagic and inshore fleets.Take away any of these fleets and our vibrant engineering sector would be unsustainable.Similarly, without all of these fleets operating, the supply chain ndash fish markets, buyers processors and haulage firms on one side and net-makers, gear providers and wholesalers on the other ndash would be gravely weakened. Jobs would go, people would move away to find work, and the community would shrivel. You can see how it works.Furthermore, the leline ferry and freight services that we are currently encouraging the Scottish Government to enhance to match the volume of seafood being exported, would look a great deal dferent.To put this volume in context, more fish is landed in Shetland every year than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland combined.Beyond that, therersquos the specialist training of fishermen and marine scientic research provided by the NAFC Marine Centre in Scalloway, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, and the small-boat marinas and remote rural piers kept up by community organisations and the local authority.All are at risk from any upset to the delicate balance of the fisheries ecosystem.One of the more persistent and unhelpful myths about the fishing industry is that success in inshore fisheries ndash however measured ndash can come only at the expense of an offshore fleet.The many iants of this theme pitch ldquohaves against ldquohave-nots, ldquobig against ldquosmall and ldquolarge-scale or ldquoindustrial against ldquoartisanal.The main recommendation arising from this viewpoint is typically the reallocation of quota between dferent parts of the fishing fleet.This argument fails to acknowledge the complexity of the relationship between dferent fleet segments in places where inshore fisheries are successful, as I have outlined.Quota is only one factor behind the success or otherwise of inshore fisheries, and quotas already allocated to inshore fleets are often poorly utilised as it is.Some species cannot be caught economically, safely or in an environmentally responsible way except by large, modern boats capable of operating both close to shore and far offshore.Dividing the fishing industry into completely separate segments is not a helpful exercise.Our experience suggests that dferent classes of fishing vessels catching fish in dferent ways effectively combine to create a critical mass in onshore services, from engineering to sale, transport and marketing.This is particularly true of the more remote coastal and island fishing communities, where an inshore fleet of small boats may not be enough to sustain the onshore businesses crucial to successful operations.So, when we look at policy prescriptions to solve this or that ldquoproblem in the industry, we really need to see them in a much wider context, to understand the whole and not just the part or parts, and recognise that they are interdependent elements of an ecosystem that suffersradical surgery is carried out without consideration of the broader impact.Thatrsquos not another way of saying that the industry is resistant to change ndash in my experience the level of innovation, investment and re-investment in fisheries, often as a result of the need to adapt to new situations, whether enforced or naturally occurring, is remarkable.Rather, that when we consider how le in our coastal communities can be improved, we ought to reflect on how we can lt all boats and not just some.Simon Collins is Executive Officer of the Shetland Fishermenrsquos Association."},{"url":null,"title":"play-pie-pint-chic-murray-funny-place-window-review","story":"BBC Scotland, Sunday pm****EVERY now and then some TV writer tipsy on nostalgia calls for theof Play for Today.

The Tories are promising the \"biggest, most generous spending review since the height of Tony Blairs New Labour\", with local councils in England expected to receive an extra pound. billion.:Marianne Taylor: Ruths replacement  Who cares when the Scottish Tories will push us off a no-deal clfAmid the Westminster chaos, Holyrood will struggle to get a look-in.But this week will also see the publication of the Scottish Governmentrsquos programme for government, with  new bills.This wonrsquot be a list of pre-election giveaways, with the First Minister stating that tackling inequality and climate changes will be at the heart of her programme. But the political rhetoric will focus on a Parliament \"getting on with the day job\" while Westminster literally prepares to shut down.The SNP is enjoying something of a purple patch, thanks in no small part to the actions of its opponents. Proroguing Parliament plays right into the Nationalistsrsquo hands. They say you should never interrupt your enemy when they are making mistakes.So it must be sorely tempting for Nicola Sturgeon to sit back and watch the chaos unfold, but as her former top adviser ndash the incomparable Kevin Pringle ndash said yesterday, the party must \"keep refreshing the policy agenda\".Few can realistically argue that the SNP hasnrsquot made progressive changes to Scotlandrsquos justice system, is working hard to tackle discrimination, and has been bold in addressing the climate crisis.But there is also no shortage of domestic challenges ahead.Education was famously billed by Ms Sturgeon as her main priority, yet there is a growing revolt over P tests, not to mention a major teacher recruitment shortage and low morale, and a failure to meet class-size targets.When Tony Blair made \"education, education, education\" his priority it led to the kind of transformational improvement that has not materialised under the SNP.This coming December the latest international comparison of performance in reading, maths and science will be published. It could be a pivotal moment for Nicola Sturgeon and her Education Secretary, John Swinney.In other policy fields, it remains to be seen whether Scottish voters are content to be told that their NHS is performing better than England, given the increasing pressures the health service is facing.The legal right patients have to be seen within  weeks has been broken , times in just a year.Operations are being cancelled because hospitals cannot cope, and a promise to end delayed discharge has still not been met.Scotlandrsquos health service needs money and resources that simply arenrsquot readily available.Tax revenues were almost pound billion less than expected for   and while Brexit is leading to economic trouble across the UK, Scotlandrsquos underlying performance remains weak despite a narrowing of its budget deficit.The financial problems wonrsquot make it any easier for ministers to achieve their signicant policy pledges set to be introduced in the months ahead.A doubling of the entitlement to early learning and childcare - from  hours to , hours - is due in August .But childcare expansion plans are missing forecasts by up to  per cent, with early learning expansion over , childcare places and more than  staff places behind schedule.Will councils be ready to deliver when the , hours entitlement comes into force \"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs oMvIrWF-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests oMvIrWF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Gordon Brown warns no-deal Brexit threatens UK food supply chain with catastropheAnd what about the ban on household waste going to landfill that will be enforced a few months later The likelihood is it will simply lead to an increase in exporting waste to England and where, with the associated financial and environmental costs.But what may cause the biggest headache for ministers is the continued transfer of welfare powers to Holyrood.There are already delays to the full roll-out until the middle of the next Parliament ndash nearly a decade after the Smith Commission made its post-referendum recommendations.Further delays have been pencilled in for disabled pensioner benefits and carers, and observers expect a further delay in at least one other area will be announced.This autumn, the Fiscal Commission will start to give forecasts on expenditure for benefits being delivered right up to the  election.It will show for the first time the full impact of social security devolution, and the pressure of increasing caseloads, on the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget.The current \"fiscal framework\" agreed in the wake of the Smith Commission devolution settlement is due to be looked at, so at some point there will have to be negotiations with the UK Government about the next deal. Last time it took months to break the deadlock and the Boris Johnson administration may well drive a harder bargain than George Osborne did.That would play right into the SNPrsquos hands in terms of political rhetoric, but an unseemly standoff wonrsquot help those relying on welfare payments.Ahead of the  General Election, a major crisis in the Scottish Governmentrsquos IT system left thousands of farmers without their farm subsidy payments, contributing to Tory gains in some rural areas.Imagine the backlashthere are similar problems with the delivery of welfare payments.These impending challenges are not necessarily all of the SNPrsquos own making. But the Nationalists have torn up the rule book which states that the party of government is the one held responsible by voters.Thatrsquos what always having someone  to blame can achieve, regardless of the truth, and right now their opponents are making it easy for them.Scottish Labour is a shadow of its former self, the Scottish Tories have lost their star, UK Labour is battling with the LibDems for a distant second place in the polls, and the UK Tories are demolishing democracy.The SNPrsquos ability to navigate choppy waters ahead will depend not only on what it does in government, but whether its opponents can rise to the challenge.There are testing times ahead for every political party."},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane-dorian-strikes-bahamas-record-winds-evacuations-ordered-us","story":"The stormrsquos top sustained winds decreased slightly to mph as its westward movement slowed, crawling along Grand Bahama island early on Monday at mph in what forecasters said would be a day-long assault.Earlier, Dorian churned over Abaco island with battering winds and surf.There was little information from the affected islands, but officials expected many residents to be left homeless.:Comedian Kevin Hart injured in car crashMost people went to shelters as the storm approached, with tourist hotels shutting down and residents boarding up their homes.ldquoItrsquos devastating, said Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Bahamasrsquo Ministry of Tourism and Aviation. ldquoThere has been huge damage to property and infrastructure.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the midst of some of Scotland’s most breathtakingly beautul scenery, amongst communities who are closer geographically to Oslo than to London, I was in constant communication with colleagues about how we protect the very democratic process being played out around me.It seemed that even here there was no escape from the flag waving, nationalism which has plunged us into this mess.And I don’t just mean Boris Johnson and his brand of Brexiteers.One of the first things that hit me on my arrival were the flags.Everywhere.I’ve often been to the Northern Isles before and I know how proud the communities in both Orkney and Shetland rightly are of their inidual colours. But this was dferent. This was not the islanders.This was a political party wrapping itself in local symbolism for its own ends. It was on their cars, posters and leaflets.For me over the past week the attempted appropriation of the flag of Shetland by the SNP has yelled out as a metaphor for the nationalist introversion which is threatening to shut down our democracy.The currency of modern Scottish politics seems to be that you have to choose which flag in which to wrap yourself. Saltire or Union To which identity are you going to confine yourself Charles Kennedy, as in so much about our politics, had the answer.Whenever he was asked he insisted that he was a Highlander, a Scot, British and a European, and that each layer of that identity was equally valuable to him.They reinforce each other and make the inidual at their heart stronger. This week, on my phone in the centre of Lerwick, being brought up to date on the national crisis, surrounded by the paraphernalia of Scottish nationalism, I felt yet again, that the fabric of my interwoven identities was under threat.It has been constant since .But this time it’s not just my identity but our democratic traditions too.The liberalism, tolerance and adherence to constitutional precedent which we have lived by for centuries is being challenged at the centre.The announcement that parliament will be suspended, our democracy is being shut down to allow the UK Government to choose how and when we leave the EU, deal or no deal, without scrutiny shook me to the core.As a history and politics undergraduate at Glasgow University I often wondered how contemporary MPs reflected on their role in issues of their time like Suez, the Suffragettes or the miners’ strike.Now I am finding out for myself.Even as the tiniest cog in that vast machinery of  elected members that is the House of Commons, I am aware of my responsibility.I have spent much of this week talking to others, reaching out to dferent parties, supporting those trying to build a consensus.And just as we thought we were getting our heads around the implications of this authoritarian power grab, there was another surprise.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, a woman who has taken her party from threatened obscurity to challenging for power at Holyrood is taking a step back.The loss of that one inidual’s input seems, right now, at this critical moment, huge.What will happen next to her party, and how her  MPs at Westminster will respond to their leader shutting down parliament, is for others to decide.For many people it must seems that it is yet more evidence of crumbling foundations.I am not one of them.This week has undoubtedly been one of the most tumultuous and tortuous in modern British political history.The next few weeks promise to bring even more drama, power plays and stress.But at the centre of it all the people on Shetland did the one thing which, in the final analysis, may provide that answer we are all looking for.They went out and voted in astonishing numbers to decide which person had the confidence of the greatest number of islanders to be their representative.While others argued about democratic rights, they exercised theirs.The majority turned their back on the flag-waving, populism and identity politics.They chose Beatrice Wishart of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The flag of Shetland belongs to all the islanders in the same way as the Saltire represents each and every political expression in Scotland, every locality and every inidual.It is my flag and yours.But it is also not all that we are.It should unite us.

The order, which covers about , people, goes into effect at noon local time on Monday, when state troopers will begin reversing lanes so they all head inland on major coastal highways.\"We cant make everybody happy,\" Mr McMaster said. \"But we believe we can keep everyone alive.\"Georgias governor Brian Kemp also ordered a mandatory evacuation of the states Atlantic coast, also starting at noon on Monday.Authorities in Florida ordered mandatory evacuations in some vulnerable coastal areas. - Doctors warn no-deal Brexit would be lsquocatastrophicrsquo for the NHSMore than  Labour Day flights in the US had been cancelled as of Sunday afternoon, many of them in Florida as Dorian barrelled towards the states coast.The only recorded storm that was more powerful was Hurricane Allen in , with mph winds.

One showed floodwaters rushing through the streets of an unidentied town at nearly the height of a car roof.In some parts of Abaco, \"you cannot tell the dference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins\", said Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.According to the Nassau , he called it \"probably the most sad and worst day of my le to address the Bahamian people\".Earlier, Mr Minnis had warned that anyone who did not evacuate was \"in extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence\".The government opened  shelters across the Bahamas. Dozens ignored evacuation orders, officials said.After the Bahamas, the slow-crawling storm was forecast to turn sharply and skirt toward the US coast, staying just off Florida and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday and then buffetingSouth Carolina and North Carolina on Thursday.The National Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane watch for Floridas East Coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Bred county line. The same area was put under a storm surge watch.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car. He had no idea what was going on. “We got him out of the car and pushed it off the road. We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu ready for more brexit talks but uk needs new backstop plan simon coveney","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.“We want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit, that moves us into a transition period that gives us time and space to work out a future relationship.“But that deal has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and it has to be consistent with that, andthe UK wants to remove an element of the Withdrawal Agreement they have to acknowledge that that causes problems and they have to propose alternatives that can solve those problems, certainly in the case of the backstop.”On Boris Johnson’s suggestion of negotiations for two days a week, Mr Coveney said: “I’m surehe wanted five days of negotiations a week, the EU would be okay with that.“Michel Barnier is there as the chief negotiator for that purpose, he has a team that’s ready to go.“We all want to get a deal but at the moment nothing credible has come from the British Government in the context of an alternative to the backstop.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Coveney said Michel Barnier and his team of Brexit negotiators are willing to dedicate their time to finding a deal “If that changes, great.

That’s not going to fly and I think it’s important that we are all honest about that.“We have always saidthere are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let’s hear them andwe can work out a deal on that basis, so be it.“But what we will not do in Ireland, and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this, we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed – i.e. the backstop, which solves a dficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis – and for that to be replaced with something that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we’ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.“That is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"house prices increased by just under 1 in ni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

indicated a “stable but lethargic” residential property market.It followed a trend of a subdued rate of house price growth over the past five quarters.Estate agents’ observations showed the absence of a Stormont executive, ongoing Brexit uncertainty and political change in Westminster had affected market sentiment, buyer activity and confidence.Dr Martin Hinch, from Ulster University, said: “The latest Ulster University quarterly house price report reveals a residential housing market that continues to display subdued levels of growth.“Whilst this trend has been observed for the last  months, the resilience of the Northern Ireland market throughout this period of unprecedented prolonged political and economic uncertainty is apparent.“Despite uncertainty around the potential implications of leaving the EU, the lack of a ing Stormont executive and ongoing turmoil in Westminster, core transaction levels and sustainable market conditions continue to prevail.”Ulster University’s research was produced in partnership with the Progressive Building Society and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.These market conditions are being influenced by the Brexit process and the lack of an accountable local executiveMichael Boyd, Progressive Building SocietyAnalysing the performance of the Northern Ireland housing market between April and June , the report revealed an overall average house price of £,, representing a nominal weighted level of growth of .% between the second quarter of last year and the same period this year.Estate agents were optimistic that the sluggish market conditions will pick up in the coming six months.Michael Boyd, deputy chief executive and finance director at the Progressive Building Society, said: “These market conditions are being influenced by the Brexit process and the lack of an accountable local executive.“However, there are still strong levels of transactions, particularly with first-time buyers, who are taking advantage of affordable housing especially compared to the rest of the UK.“Looking forward, we will continue to work to support an affordable housing market and while Brexit continues to impact growth, clarity around the process will be a welcome stimulus for the local market.”There is also evidence of some challenges for the first-time buyers who have played an important role in driving the market over recent yearsKarly Greene, Northern Ireland Housing ExecutiveKarly Greene, head of research at the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which commissioned the research, said: “For a sixth consecutive quarter,

Another £, was donated to two English residents.The remainder of his estate, which included assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand, was handed to the executors and trustees of his will - Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin - for Sinn Fein.At the time Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin were the partys national treasurers. Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline.

responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can

It can and must be avoided.”Kevin Hanratty, director of the Human Rights Consortium, another signatory, said: “This campaign is about bringing together the many voices of civic society and the public, who have clearly and consistently articulated the many reasons why a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for Northern Ireland.“For us, there is a clear risk to hard-won rights protections but for others it may be something dferent.“The unying element is that all of those voices are saying No To No Deal.”Patricia McKeown, regional secretary of the trade union Unison, said: “A no-deal UK exit from the EU would be disastrous for workers, their families and communities across Northern Ireland.“The risk of a no-deal exit is only increasing after Boris Johnson’s outrageous move to close Parliament.“Regardless of the political chaos unfolding at Westminster, the trade union movement and our allies across civic society will remain steadfast in demanding the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and our members’ rights and livelihoods.Declassied files: Public took risk for ash liability Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

the island of Ireland.”Robert Murtagh, president of students union body NUS-USI, said a no-deal would have a “devastating” impact on Northern Ireland.“A no-deal outcome must be stopped so that NI doesn’t lose cross-border student mobility, EU-funded apprenticeship places, Erasmus+ student opportunities, access to EU research funding and recognition of qualications,” he said.“Students and young people, many of whom were born after the Good Friday Agreement, deserve hope not a future of lost opportunities as a result of a no-deal Brexit.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to ..

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
