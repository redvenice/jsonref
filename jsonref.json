Though Akihito has avoided a direct apology, he has subtly stepped up his expressions of regret over the past years in carefully scripted statements on the war. \u0027During the 74 years since the end of the war, the peace and prosperity of our country today has been built through the tireless efforts of the people.

Instead, he made a long list of damage inflicted on Japan and its people, including the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, massive fire bombings of Tokyo and the fierce battle of Okinawa.The emperor\u0027s words have taken on greater importance and caught attention as Abe has increasingly sought to whitewash Japan\u0027s troubled and embarrassing past since taking office in December 2012. Abe has since stopped acknowledging Japan\u0027s wartime hostilities in his Aug. 15 speech, ending a tradition that past prime ministers had handed down since the 1995 apology by a Socialist leader Tomiichi Murayama.

The owners of the petrol station and East Midlands Airport said picking up or dropping off people at The Fuel Station is strongly prohibited and several signs stating this have been up since June.Sharon and Geoffrey Palmer, both 69, stopped to fill their car at the airport\u0027s petrol station on July 11 before being dropped off at the rapid drop-off zone, where their daughter drove the car home.But on their return from a week-long holiday in Salou, Spain , they were horrified to find a £60 fine, rising to £100 if left unpaid.         Miss Stevens is the latest in a host of motorists to express their anger over a parking fine from the owners of the petrol stationGordon Jackson from Chellaston and Tajdar Kamal from Normanton were heavily critical after being fined after being seen picking up airport passengers in their cars.And earlier this month, Ruth Pickering, from Clifton, Nottinghamshire, said she would refuse to pay her fine.But Miss Stevens insists she never picked up her daughter from the station and actually paid £4 to park in the short stay car park.A spokesman for Vehicle Control Services Limited, which issued the fine, said: \u0027We would advise Ms Stevens to utilise our appeals procedure so that her circumstances can be fully and appropriately evaluated, details of how to appeal are set out on the reverse of the Parking Charge Notice.\u0027         Weeks later Miss Stevens was shocked to discover she had received a £100 parking bill through her door for \u0027stopping at a zone where stopping is prohibited\u0027 The Prax Group, which owns the petrol station, said the behaviour of some motorists was having a \u0027negative impact on the business\u0027 and defended issuing fines for those picking up or dropping airport passengers at the station rather than paying to use the airport car parks.A spokesman said: \u0027In order to avoid paying to park, some passengers and taxi companies are using the airport filling station, located approximately 100 yards from the terminal, as a pick up and drop off point.\u0027Increasingly, this is having a negative impact on the business, which can no longer be ignored.\u0027Additionally, there is a serious health and safety concern, as the backlog of traffic onto the main road could potentially hinder the emergency services. \u0027         Sharon and Geoffrey Palmer (pictured with their penalty notice on August 8), both 69, were also recent victims of the airport\u0027s strict parking regulationsA spokesman for East Midlands Airport said: \u0027Parking or waiting on roads across the airport estate has always been prohibited. \u0027While this was previously indicated by double yellow lines, all roads are now red-routed and are enforced by a third party organisation. \u0027The same compliance company also has a separate agreement in place with the petrol station.\u0027The safety of people visiting and working on the airport site is our number one priority.          Ruth Pickering (pictured on August 5), 52, received a £60 fine for stopping in a \u0027no stop\u0027 zone at East Midlands Airport.

She talks about her son’s medical crisis, ‘goose fathers’ and Trump’s slursTwice a day, every day for almost a month, Angie Kim and her then-two-year-old son would enter a hyperbaric oxygen tank, and be sealed inside. Kim’s son had ulcerative colitis, a condition that caused him great pain, and the constant vomiting had left him underweight. The theory behind hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) goes that if damaged cells need oxygen to heal, immersing a patient in pure oxygen will accelerate healing. Although the experimental treatment was not FDA-approved and has no proven benefits, it was a last resort Kim was willing to try.Her son called the tank “the submarine”, and he wasn’t far off: when the hatch was closed, the dim, warm space, lit only by flickering episodes of Barney and Sesame Street outside the portholes, could almost have been underwater Kim, 15 years on, likens it to confession. As the children watched TV, the bored caregivers and parents, wearing only cotton clothing and liberated of their potentially flammable glasses, underwire bras and belts, began to talk.There, Kim found a window into other peoples’ lives. One of the children was a fecal smearer, which could interrupt a “e” as they all filed out for the tank to be cleaned – which could set off another child, who’d violently bang his head against the wall. She began to feel guilty: though her son was in pain, the other children were mostly severely autistic or disabled and for their parents, HBOT was a stab in the dark for children who couldn’t walk, talk or hug. “I had always thought of myself and my family as the unlucky ones,” the author, now 50, says. “That son was also deaf in one ear and had coeliac disease. My other son had anaphylactic food allergies. I couldn’t work because of all the CT scans, MRIs and specialist cooking I needed to do. So I felt really sorry for us until I met these families, who were so upbeat. It made me have such a totally different outlook on life, the relativity of happiness.”Her debut thriller Miracle Creek centres on that relativity, and the explosion of a HBOT tank, which injures many and kills two, one being Henry, a severely autistic boy. As new details are unearthed by shark-like lawyers, characters go from “hero to murderer in an hour” and the truth becomes more and more unfixed as gossip spreads in the small town. But for Kim, the explosion was “a Trojan horse, a MacGuffin” that gave her space to explore deeper issues: the identity crisis among migrants in the US, the realities of severe autism and chronic illness, and the extremes of parental sacrifice.Of the latter, there are plenty. Elizabeth, who may or may not have killed her son Henry, finds herself on trial but liberated of a responsibility she increasingly resented. Teresa, nicknamed Mother Teresa for her squeaky clean image, wishes the trial would last longer because it gives her time away from her daughter. And Pak, the owner of the HBOT tank and a “goose father” – a South Korean phenomenon where patriarchs send their children and wives abroad while they save money to migrate as well. He feels “the shame of becoming less proficient, less adult, than his own child”, Mary, a teenager who serves as the family translator and is increasingly contemptuous of both her parents.Kim’s father was neither a goose nor a penguin father (the latter being those who can’t afford a short annual visit like the former). The family left Seoul together for suburban Baltimore when Kim was 11. In Korea, a teacher had asked for students to nominate themselves to be class president Kim was the only girl to raise her hand and the teacher slapped her with a ruler in front of the class, “for daring to think girls can be president of anything. Korea is a very male-dominated, patriarchal culture where having sons is everything. When my mum heard she was so angry and I think it was a big motivator for the move. Ironically, Korea had a female president before the US.”When they arrived, Kim lived with her aunt and uncle while her parents ran a grocery store downtown, where they also slept, among the cans and food in the back room. Kim, an only child, resented their sacrifice. For the first time, she had her own bedroom and indoor plumbing – but no parents. “I accused them of abandoning me. We were so poor in Korea, so coming to the US was a fortunate thing. But losing contact with my parents was something I really resented, so I acted up.” It wasn’t until 40 years later, writing Miracle Creek, that she acknowledged it was a sacrifice: “You’d think after law school and having children of my own that I would have let it go. But we never talked about it. Writing made me consider what it had been like for them. I realised I had been a brat. They have read it and we had a really cathartic conversation. That’s the best thing that came out of this novel for me.”Before having her own children, Kim worked as a trial lawyer. She loved the drama but hated the machismo of the courtroom. After a busy period, she took a brief break in San Francisco she went to an empty cliffside restaurant and spent the entire day there, alone with a bottle of wine and a plate of cheese and reading Tim O’Brien’s In the Lake of the Woods cover to cover. “When I closed it, I couldn’t remember being so happy. That day, I decided to quit.” Though she would later become a dotcom entrepreneur, then stay at home for her sons for a decade, she decided to be an author that day.Decades on, with her first book under her belt, she finds herself alongside fellow migrant authors including Ocean Vuong and Viet Thanh Nguyen, writing back to the US about itself in both fiction and reality: all three recently signed a starry open letter calling for an end to inhumane conditions in detention centres on the US-Mexico border.The migrant perspective is crucial in the US, Kim says, because “we are like a really close friend who loves you, but can also tell you what you need to hear. Migrants have a responsibility as people who have chosen to come to this country to bring that perspective, to make us stronger. I disagree with the argument that says we should be grateful, or shut up and ‘go back to where we came from’.”As for Trump’s recent racist comments, she remembers a confusing two-month period when she first arrived in the US during which she was finally able understand enough English to know other children were mocking her, her looks, her smell, but without the language to respond. “I went from feeling grateful I could finally understand to feeling awful because these seemingly nice kids had been making fun of me the entire time. When I hear Trump saying, ‘go back to where you came from’, it takes me back 40 years. I’m fluent, I’m successful, I went to great schools. And all of those things, just hearing that happen to someone else, makes me cry and makes me feel like I don’t belong, even today.”• Miracle Creek by Angie Kim (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £16.99).

We believe that concern is unjustified given Burford’s control structure and ignores Burford’s finance and accounting structure.

O’Connell will now serve in the lower-tier role of chief strategy officer.But Burford’s efforts failed to pacify Carson Block, the founder of Muddy Waters, who said the new finance chief was still too cosy with Burford’s leadership given the firm had been his client at Morgan Stanley.“The notion that appointing Mr Kilman as CFO will substantively improve governance is a farce … Burford investors would be much better served by a CFO from the outside who is untainted by Burford’s conduct to date,” Block said.Muddy Waters’ public attack on Burford last week wiped £1bn off the company’s value. The fund disclosed that it held a short position on Burford shares and was betting that the price would fall.Burford has said efforts by Muddy Waters to depress its share price could amount to market manipulation. The City watchdog has begun “wide-ranging inquiries” over the cause of the share price drop.Burford said on Thursday it was also searching for two new independent directors, one of whom would replace Sir Peter Middleton as chairman. Middleton has been in the job for 10 years, surpassing the nine-year limit suggested by the UK corporate governance code.Burford also revealed plans to become the first publicly traded litigation finance firm in the US. It said it hoped to float on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange by March 2020. Muddy Waters claimed Burford had dodged broader disclosure requirements by staying listed on London’s alternative investment market.Middleton said: “We trust that these governance enhancements operate to bolster investor confidence in Burford as it enters its next era of growth and success.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb114a45c2156dcca30590b2c3111b14da376987/275_190_1695_1017/master/1695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6c5187f9de01adbb50798a42398240d","title":"theres a real scene happening here how dig brew co put birmingham craft beer on the map","story":" Oliver Webb started brewing while at university. Now he runs Dig Brew Co, which produces the tipples of choice for Birmingham’s cultural sceneOn the edge of Birmingham’s city centre lies Digbeth, a partially deserted industrial landscape of former Victorian factories, warehouses and tall railway arches. For the past few decades, it has been a handy place for artists and independent businesses to set up shop and take advantage of large spaces with low rents. Dig Brew Co, founded by 27-year-old Oliver Webb, recently joined this artistic hub, its craft brewery and taproom sitting proudly in a former gun factory on River Street.Webb studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, part of University College London, and says sky-high prices in the capital gave him the idea to start running bars. “We’d be working until 10pm but couldn’t afford to go anywhere, as all the bars and clubs in London are so expensive. So I set up a bar in my studio space and started serving cocktails and cheap beer we bought from the supermarket,” he says.Webb used his artist’s woodworking and sculpture skills to create a collapsible “tiki bar” in his parents’ back garden in Wolverhampton. He shipped it to London and also started to brew his own beer. “We made our own beer from home-brew kits, as it was cheaper than buying from supermarkets. The bar was really popular and we just put out a donation box for people. But, eventually, the police shut us down for not having a licence.”From that point on, the idea of running a pub was in Webb’s mind, and he began learning the art of brewing. Meanwhile, his lecturers were recommending that students visit the growing number of galleries and exhibitions happening in Digbeth. Webb left university and worked briefly for a log cabin company, while also selling tiki bars on the side. His father introduced him to Peter Towler, the owner of Mad O’Rourke’s World Famous Pie Factory. Towler decided to back the young entrepreneur, and Dig Brew Co took possession of its brewery space in March 2017.“I painted it all myself,” recalls Webb. “I rented a sprayer and covered the walls with £1,000 worth of white paint. I built the bar myself, too. We got mash tun, kettles and fermenters on hire purchase – I could never have done that without Peter.”To make it easy for customers to pay, Webb brought in iZettle’s payment systems to enable card payments. “They are easy to use and so training staff is no problem. The machine connects to an app and that makes sense to our staff and customers,” he says.The brewery, opened in October 2017, now employs 20 staff and brews a selection of lagers, stouts and bitters, including its double IPA Dagger Dagger and popular Hell lager. Webb hired a head brewer who now looks after the beer, while he focuses on running the business. However, Webb says it took a while to catch on. “When we opened, nothing much happened. We knew nothing about PR or promotions, so there weren’t many people coming in,” he says.But sometimes, when you’re struggling, helping others can be the answer. James Connolly, owner of Gorilla Coffee Cafe, became a customer and taproom regular when Webb helped him out of a tight spot. “Oli was in my cafe and he saw I was having trouble with a broken beer dispenser,” Connolly recounts. “He lent me one and so I ended up buying some beer from him. A lot of our customers are his target market. They want a sense of community, an experience, and they want it to be fun,” he says.Other local businesses and arts venues liked the idea of buying beer brewed in Brum and Webb also started selling kegs to businesses such as the burger restaurant Original Patty Men. Webb’s arts background helped him make connections and see opportunities that other breweries would likely miss. One example was the decision to host the Infinite Opera company, which performed Besse, a production about beer, feminism and witchcraft. “It was a fitting venue as the early brewsters were all women,” says Kim McAleese, programme director at Grand Union, which houses the Infinite Opera. “There were over a hundred people here to see the Infinite Opera perform between the steel tanks in the brewery.”Local festivals and event spaces have also been big buyers, with the Home of Metal Black Sabbath rock exhibition and gallery space Eastside Projects among its client list. But the big breakthrough for Dig Brew Co came when it beat Guinness to become sponsor for Birmingham’s St Patrick’s Day event and its Mayo stout was on offer to the thousands that attended.“There were smiles all around the room when we made that decision,” says Peter Connolly, chairman of the St Patrick’s Day festival. “Most of the pubs in Digbeth are independently owned by Irish families and Dig Brew Co is all about community,” he adds.Webb says he wants his business to be about far more than just making beer. The city of Birmingham has been through hard times, but he and others in the arts and creative sector seem determined for it to have brighter days. “There’s a real scene happening here and we are providing beer for a lot of those involved in it.”To find out how iZettle helps small businesses like Dig Brew Co, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f26bd299e1cf021eea9216490310a7197fd1b5df/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ef8584e31715a2fbaf57647a2c9cb7","title":"going cashless has been huge for us the coffee shop thats stopped using cash","story":"For young entrepreneur Ed Barry, running a business has had its ups and downs. But embracing the cashless economy has paid offIt’s no secret that the great British high street is warming to the idea of going, if not cashless, then certainly less cash. In the past 15 years, we’ve seen the introduction of contactless cards and mobile phone payments (or digital wallets).That’s exactly what Ed Barry, 28, owner of west London coffee shop and cocktail bar Over Under Coffee, has done. Barry’s Earl’s Court shop is only a stone’s throw away from the tube station, where relaxed customers work on their laptops or discuss things over plates of food from the simple “toast and toppings” menu, made in the shop’s flatpack kitchen.The space is small but comfy, and the furnishings simple but effective, much like the business as a whole. For two years, Over Under Coffee has been a cashless business – a practice more common now, but not so when he first adopted it after a successful trial month at the start of 2018.Barry recalls some teething issues – the odd customer who’d prefer cash, for example – but Over Under Coffee was already taking the vast majority of its payments using card and, reflecting back on it, Barry feels his business has reached the level it’s at today because of the decision.“Going cashless has been huge for us,” Barry says. “It’s been a big talking point, and everyone knows about it. I think generally Londoners are warming to it, because of things such as Oyster cards, for example.“We’ve had a few hiccups along the way, but generally it’s been quicker for us – quicker for the customer.”His two shops in Earl’s Court and West Brompton have been operating completely cashless for more than two years, powered solely by iZettle and Barry and his team’s enthusiasm.For the uninitiated, iZettle is a mobile point-of-sale device and integrated app that takes card payments, both contactless and chip and pin. It’s affordable – with an iZettle Reader only costing £29 (for your first reader, £59 for subsequent readers) without having to sign up to a contract or pay high fees – and its accompanying app can be used for accounting, inventory and business analytics, which has helped Barry every step of the way.“iZettle has always been super supportive of us: we always get a really good rate, and we’re not tied into a contract,” Barry says. “The devices look cool on the counter and they’re portable, too – we do a lot of events and we just use our phone hotspot to make payments, so it’s really easy to use. It’s basically plug and pay for payments, so it’s great for small businesses like us.”“Supporting independent businesses such as Over Under Coffee is iZettle’s whole reason for existing. We want to ensure that they have the tools they need to start, run and grow their businesses,” says Ed Hallett, managing director at iZettle UK.At 6pm at Over Under Coffee, the counters, seating and walls all flip around to reveal their evening cocktail bar alter egos.“I wanted to create a really welcoming environment, and have that throughout the day and then throughout the night,” Barry says. “My whole ethos is: there’s no point in working in hospitality if you’re not going to have a positive impact on somebody’s day. A positive mental attitude is something I try to filter through our entire company and culture.“Just because there’s a counter between us doesn’t mean we can’t talk like we’re mates. It’s not going to please everyone, but I’d rather verge on too friendly than the opposite.”But it’s not always been easy for him to create and run a business as a millennial entrepreneur in London.“There have definitely been tough periods. Some months I couldn’t pay myself any money. I had never run my own shop, I’d never been a boss, I’d never written employment contracts, or taken accounts,” Barry explains. “We opened our second shop too quickly and had to close it within four months. We picked the wrong location, we got the layout of the bar wrong, we hired the wrong people.“But now we’ve got another shop in West Brompton, west London, and are opening another place in Manchester next month. So each year you have to take stock of what you’ve learned and realise that the things you thought were problems at first are actually very easy to do, but only if you’re willing to learn on the job.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1b0dc6ee8f4dec5af258c787b953c417af5049/0_66_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=818739c85203c89addfad8b8c84dce54","title":"learn what people want 10 tips on how to create a successful vintage fashion business","story":"Flea markets are a favourite weekend pastime for many. Here’s how to turn your passion for fashion into a bustling market stallIf your ideal weekend is spent hitting up car boot sales, browsing charity shops and scouring Etsy for the perfect vintage find, then having your own stall may seem like the dream job – or at least the dream side hustle. But what are the tips and tricks to make your vintage fashion business a success? We asked successful stall owners how they went from vintage fan to thriving market trader – and how you can do the same.1. Start small“Don’t get carried away and invest a lot of money at the start,” says Amanda Barnes, whose shop Ooh La La Vintage in Dorset began as a stall at events and vintage festivals. “Keep expectations realistic and reassess every few months before you buy more stock. Even if you’re just doing it as a hobby, it’s a good idea to write a loose business plan. Decide how much you’ll spend on stock, and think about other expenses, such as travel and the cost of the pitch. Then work out how much you need to sell to recoup costs and turn a profit.”2. Follow your passion“Think about your current vintage collection and whether there’s a theme that stands out, because that’s what you should focus on,” says Sarah Horrillo, who started her Portobello Road stall London Vintage six years ago. “When I first started out, I did a lot of vintage table linens and homeware now I just focus on women’s clothes. But your passion might be accessories or childrenswear or denim or ’50s clothes. As you build up your business, people will come to associate you with a particular theme.”3. Build a brand“From the outset, think about who you’re trying to reach and what you’re offering,” says Kerry Norton, a part-time nurse who also runs Sisters of the Moon, a vintage stall in London and Brighton. “Get a logo and business cards, so that if a customer doesn’t buy anything that day, they can go away and find you. Get an Instagram account – it’s a really important way to build up a following – and pay attention to analytics. If a particular item is getting lots of likes, you’ll know to look out for similar pieces.”4. Go contactless“I set myself up with iZettle straight away,” says Norton. “Loads of people don’t carry cash and people want contactless payments, which makes things so much easier and quicker and less hassle than rummaging around for change. It’s also a good idea to have a separate bank account for your stall, so you can keep track of incomings and outgoings.”5. Always be on the hunt“The hardest part of the job is finding the right pieces – and no one wants to reveal their sources,” says Norton. “Some traders use wholesalers, but my stock is all inidually sourced. Always keep your eye out wherever you go, and be willing to do repairs.” Horrillo takes an empty suitcase when she goes on holiday, as she says she never knows where she might find a gem. “The best advice I can give is to only buy things you love. Don’t be swayed by a designer label, or overthink it and buy something because you think it will sell – that never works.”6. It’s good to talk“Chatting to your customers is a great way to learn what people want,” says Barnes. “That’s your market, so it’s a great way to get instant feedback on what you’re doing. Do they want things in bigger sizes? Are they looking for better quality? Are they finding items too expensive? Take it all on board and adapt your strategy accordingly.”7. Get friendlyTeaming up with a friend who also loves vintage fashion can be a good way to split pitch costs and make selling more fun. “It’s also a good idea to make friends with fellow stall owners,” says Jean Thompson of Love Vintage, based in Leeds. “They can watch the stall for you when you’re having a break, and will often have loads of great advice if they’ve been doing it for years. There’s a really nice community of vintage traders and we all help each other out.”8. Presentation is key“Take the time to make sure your items are nicely presented, ironed, clean and clearly priced,” says Barnes. “Make sure all of a garment’s seams, buttons and fastenings are intact, too. People want to immediately incorporate an item into their wardrobe – they don’t want to take it home and spend time repairing it.”9. Get organised“Try to lay out your stock in an orderly way,” says Thompson. “That also makes it easier to keep track of your current inventory, and pull out similar pieces when they do sell.” Norton suggests thinking about how you’ll transport your stock and where you’ll put it when you’re not on the stall. “I had a year of keeping all my stock in my tiny flat, but now I use a storage facility,” she says. “It’s a hidden cost that I didn’t think about at the start, but for me it’s well worth it.”10. Accept the ups and downs“You can have long quiet periods, and that’s scary,” says Norton. “But you have to think on a monthly basis rather than having a bad day and then feeling despondent. If you do have an unsuccessful selling day, try to think about what you can learn from it – maybe it wasn’t the right location for you, for example. Ultimately, I’m doing something I enjoy and, for me, that’s much more rewarding than a regular paycheck.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8cbf9248ede7044d723b441a5e4cfa478f7d4f/0_249_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bdf25d095c302758d0e29be5d1c772c","title":"brexiteers uk farming agriculture no deal brexit","story":"A small flock of sheep is trotting down Whitehall today to join a meeting of farmers who are coming together to mark the launch of a devastating report on the impact of a no-deal Brexit. The report rings the death knell for upland hill farming, but sheep are only the first in the line of fire: it also warns that half of Britain’s farms would go out of business and calls for a public vote before any Brexit.Now there are varying views available on all this. Patrick Minford, the Brexiteers’ favoured economist, wants shops flooded with cheap imports floating free on global commodities markets, unfettered by regulatory checks, with no tariffs or protection for home produce. Cheap food, promised by Jacob Rees-Mogg, will please consumers and Minford is sanguine about farmers, fishers and most British manufacturers going to the wall. That’s a price worth paying, a valid trade-off for market extremists, who are careless about food security, happy for us to grow nothing ourselves, leaving us wholly dependent on world markets. Minfordites are untouched by the romance of farming or the pull of manufacturing – shrugging them off as relatively small parts of the economy. Finance and services are the only future.But that was not the vision sold to the public by Brexiteers at the 2016 referendum. If it was their secret ideology, it was kept hidden from voters who backed Brexit. That dream of “taking back control” and restoring British sovereignty was coupled to nostalgic imagery of British farming, fishing and manufacturing. Homegrown things would flourish: no one said they would be thrown to the wolves of yet harsher globalisation. Backing Britishness – mainly Englishness – was the theme tune, not unleashing an agricultural Armageddon that would alter forever the old English landscape, with no sheep safely grazing the hillsides.The tragedy is that so many farmers voted for this destruction of their own livelihoods: Rickard says they were seduced by Owen Paterson, who toured rural areas telling farmers that after Brexit they could have all the advantages of sales to the EU with none of the regulation and paperwork. Now, at the 11th hour, this report should be a wake-up call for what no deal means. “They can stop insulting us and calling this project fear. Let them come up with their own figures,” Rickard challenges the government.This should galvanise farmers into action. The ones launching today’s report are taking it on a roadshow around the country to key agricultural constituencies, warning their fellow farmers and calling on Tory MPs in rural seats not to allow a no-deal Brexit without giving the public a vote.If this were France, farmers confronted with a government about to destroy them wouldn’t be driving a few sheep down Whitehall. They’d barricade Westminster with battalions of muck-spreading tractors: maybe British farmers will in due course.There are others, too, who should hurry to read this report – the scriptwriters of The Archers. Extraordinarily, Brexit barely gets a mention in the show, though it’s about to break over the dunderheads of David, Ruth, Brian, Helen, Eddie Grundy and all the rest of them. It’s time they woke up too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9ef32d02b8282057e2533d9df0033c091cf45d/0_238_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fef1130e891339e657dbf5f0e3fb5c15","title":"the guardian view on peterloo 200 years on a defining moment","story":"We are what we remember. The massacre of men, women and a child at St Peter’s Field in Manchester, 200 years ago on Friday, had a seismic impact and has reverberated ever since. Around 60,000 people – half the local population on some counts – had gathered for a peaceful, orderly and legal rally 18 died and hundreds were wounded as sabre-wielding cavalry charged into the crowd. Women had played a striking role in organising the meeting, and casualties were disproportionately female.Its memory was mobilised in the campaigns for successive reform acts, and invoked by suffragettes Labour’s evocation of a future made by “the many not the few” echoes Shelley’s The Masque of Anarchy, written in anguished response to the slaughter. The meeting grew out of the broader ferment across the north, driven by dire economic straits, yet was an explicitly political demand for representation. Now, those who memorialise it know that universal suffrage is necessary but not sufficient, and politics needs new ways of addressing economic injustice.Why, then, does this massacre still matter in 2019? The broad answer is that modern Britain does not know or think enough about its history. In the conservative island story, Peterloo is often ignored. It is rarely taught in schools. It challenges the narrative that Britons won democracy by piecemeal, peaceful reform. That version treats protest and crowds as a distraction from the forward march of enlightened British greatness.But Britain has other traditions. Peterloo is a particularly bloody example of many other confrontations – some bigger, many smaller, some for noble causes, others for ignoble ones, some more violent, many more peaceful – which are just as much a part of the complex tapestry of history as kings, queens, battles and great inventions. This narrative stretches from the peasants’ revolt through Peterloo to the marches against Brexit, with many stops along the way and down many historical byways.The immediate aftermath saw increased repression. The key speaker, Henry Hunt, was jailed the Six Acts sought to prevent large meetings and gagged newspapers it was their powerful accounts of events (one by John Edward Taylor, who would launch the Manchester  two years later), which had led to public outrage. But the massacre and ensuing crackdown discredited the political system more utterly than an unhindered meeting could ever have done. The governing classes themselves recognised the cost: the state still carried out violent suppressions, but would shy from the use of lethal force on the British mainland. It opened the eyes of many in the middle class to the need for reform. It showed workers just how essential basic political rights were. It helped to catalyse the political change that began with the 1832 Reform Act that gave cities like Manchester representation at Westminster, and which culminated in universal suffrage in 1928.Ten years ago, when the artist Jeremy Deller organised a procession in Manchester, one group of marchers held high the banner: “Our ancestors were at Peterloo.” It was in part a literal, local statement. But it also recognised, as we should today, that those who fell in Manchester helped us rise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df178c09a8d7005c6143cde1994f088dbfae423/310_0_2538_1524/master/2538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673c2d485d6ea2779aedde7ed62837f3","title":"english a level tell us whats driving the drop in take up of the subject","story":"We want to hear from students and teachers why English is declining as a choice for A-level pupilsOnce a popular subject choice for sixth formers, schools are now seeing a sharp drop in the take-up of English literature and language at A-level.Some blame the recently reformed English GCSEs for “sucking the joy” out of the subject, while others suggest the push for vocational secondary education is stopping people from choosing it.We want to hear from students, educators, parentss about why you think fewer people are studying English at A-level.

The scholarships are to cover the full cost of tuition fees and a maintenance grant for up to four years of any undergraduate course.Jill Duffy of the OCR exam board said the shift – a 10 percentage point change compared with 2012 – was the result of years of effort to get over some of the stereotypes girls might have had about studying science.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, said: “I’m delighted to see more pupils choosing science-related subjects. This is encouraging particularly as we look to boost science in this country and the skills we’ll need in the future.”But scientists warned that the improvement should not overshadow the fact that several subjects, including maths and computing, remained heavily populated by males.Sarah Main, executive director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, said: “Progress has been made in subjects such as physics, however it continues to lag behind most subjects in terms of gender ersity.”The Institute of Physics said more needed to be done to encourage girls to study technical subjects. “We continue to be deeply concerned that even in 2019 there are still so many ways in which girls are steered away from taking up technical sciences,” said Charles Tracy, the IOP’s head of education.This year’s results in England include falls in the numbers taking maths and English A-levels, a change thought to be driven by the introduction of more rigorous GCSE exams as well as the popularity of alternatives such as psychology. But budget pressures on colleges may also be behind the fall in entries.Contrary to expectation, the popularity of Chinese among 18-year-olds declined this year, with entries down from a high of 3,334 last year to 2,272. There was much excitement last year when it became the third most popular modern language, but German regained the third spot this summer with 3,033 entries, still marginally down on last year’s total of 3,058.Kirsty Williams, the education minister for Wales, said: “We’ve seen a positive set of results this year with a historically strong performance across the board for all grades. The record number of A*-A shows our top performing students are really flourishing and reaching their full potential.”University admissions offices across the UK are braced for record numbers of inquiries through clearing and adjustment, where students accept offers for undergraduate study or seek new courses after receiving their exam results. More than 70,000 candidates were expected to use clearing, with the number boosted by the large number of courses still available and by a new ability for applicants to release their existing offers to seek other opportunities.Angela Rayner MP, the shadow education secretary, congratulated students on their results, and reiterated Labour’s policy of bringing in post-A-level admissions for university students.“We need to give more support to our students, so Labour will abolish predicted grades and implement post-qualification admissions. This will allow those studying to make informed choices, and reduce the stress of the transition to higher education,” Rayner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a76dbe9278c4623be17cbaf17e8464b87220c8a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68bb5c44d51f1f56bcbafb33124440a5","title":"share your reaction and experiences on a level results day 2019","story":"Whatever your story, and wherever you’re headed next, tell us how you feel about this year’s resultsEmotions will be running high on Thursday as students across the country get their A-level results.

Cuadrilla had been forced to abandon its first well after repeatedly breaching the earthquake regulations.A department spokesman said: “Shale gas could be an important new domestic energy source, reducing the level of gas imports while delivering broad economic benefits, including through the creation of well-paid, quality jobs. It could also support our transition to net zero emissions by 2050.“We have world-leading regulations that ensure shale gas exploration happens in a safe and environmentally responsible way. The Oil and Gas Authority is undertaking a scientific assessment of recent industry data, which we will consider once completed.”Daniel Carey-Dawes, infrastructure campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said the government’s new position “could open the door to more and stronger earthquakes caused by fracking”. He said the shift was “deeply concerning” because the public was clear that it did not want earthquake regulations to be weakened.Carey-Dawes added: “A decision to relax seismicity regulations would further undermine public confidence and come with significant environmental risks. It is therefore imperative that the government attempts to restore public faith by making a firm commitment to uphold these regulations.”The government’s renewed support for shale comes less than a month after a government reshuffle by Boris Johnson which ousted Greg Clark as business secretary in favour of Andrea Leadsom, an outspoken supporter of the shale gas industry. In the past Leadsom has hailed shale gas as a “great opportunity” saying the UK would be “mad not to look at what we can do at home”, according to a report in PoliticsHome.Fracking involves pumping high-pressure water, sand and chemicals into tightly packed shale rock formations. The process fractures the rocks and releases the gas contained within the shale layers. Opponents argue that, as well as contributing to sources of greenhouse gas-generating fossil fuels, fracking poses a threat to the local environment.Jamie Peters, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Kick-starting an entire new fossil fuel industry when the impacts of climate breakdown are already ruining lives, including right here in the UK, doesn’t line up with the government’s claims to be a climate leader.”The government’s climate watchdog has said that fracking would only be compliant with the UK’s legally binding climate targets of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 if the practice replaced gas that would otherwise have been imported from overseas, and if it kept a lid on “carbon leaks” during production.Rosie Rogers, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, said: “In a climate emergency it’s shocking that the government is wasting any time thinking about fracking. Fracking is our first post-truth industry, where there is no product, no profit and no prospect of either. It’s time the government admitted that they backed the wrong horse and started backing the right one.”Cuadrilla has said it will ask for extra time to drill for shale gas at its Lancashire fracking site at Preston New Road after its licence expires this November. Cuadrilla hopes its drilling work will make the case for the UK’s shale gas ambitions and convince regulators to ease the earth tremor limits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea09f0162570b711fd7fd7f9932af27eca81ca48/0_112_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c6c280fe733af6152575454786b009","title":"tell us how have you reused your wedding dress","story":"We want to hear if you opted for a non-traditional dress, or if you’ve repurposed it so you could wear it againWorn for the big day, gone tomorrow – for many people a wedding dress will be the single most expensive item of clothing they ever buy.

These days a salad can mean almost anything – except dietingI had a conversation once with the very urbane chef and pioneer of the contemporary British scene, Rowley Leigh. He didn’t understand salads, he said, now that people had started putting things like meat in them. I disagreed: it is wonderful to find meat in a salad, a windfall, a gift from the universe, like putting your winter coat on for the first time that season and finding a tenner.Anyway, I only name-drop because salad is quite an interesting waypoint in the evolution of cuisine: there is a purist old guard who can innovate like crazy within a dish, but likes to maintain categories as they have always been – salads with the emphasis on “side”, centrepiece dishes rather than small plates. And then there is a modern wave, which likes to throw everything into the same dish, so anything can be a salad, so long as it’s not hot. And even if it is, they will sometimes call it a “warm salad”. I can see the merit in both sides, but am going to come down on the second.I don’t want to linger on the meat salad because, long term, it is my sworn intent to stop eating meat. But just in the meantime, the all-time best, all-year-round, are: the duck salad in the Ivy, for which I will waive my no-fruit-in-a-savoury-thing salad rule a roast chicken, flat leaf parsley and lemon salad, for which you slice lemons vertically, like mandarin segments, and (there is something incredibly chic about this, but I cannot tell you what) a bacon and egg salad with asparagus, garlic chives and pea shoots, by the current king of salads, the American cook Joshua McFadden and the Vietnamese chicken and cabbage salad, for which Andrea Nguyen has a stunning recipe (this doubles as the best low-calorie, low-carb, low-fat, low-everything-except-salt salad).Salads have historically been associated with self-denial, which is not quite right – you can joylessly squeeze a lime over some leaves, but that’s not really a salad, that’s more of a garnish of self-hate. A properly dressed salad is no more abstemious than anything else. But millennial salad-entrepreneurs – I’m talking about McFadden again, really – have beefed them up (not with beef!), and the broad trend now is for a salad to be more like an actual meal. He ides the year into six seasons rather than four (the adds are early summer and late summer the others remain the same) and typically builds a salad around a core vegetable. He then chucks so much ancillary protein and flavour at it that it’s like a brass band made of food: celery, sausage, provolone, olives and pickled pepper salad raw corn with walnuts, mint and chillis raw brussels sprouts with anchovy, lemon and pecorino (he does other things beside salad it’s just the salads that I happen to love).If you’re prepared to discard rawness from your salad criteria, you open up to the world of the blanched or roasted vegetable. Green beans are peculiarly versatile, and peppers are very attractive, but I like that mystery of the vegetable that is a bit boring when hot and becomes exponentially more delicious as it cools down the cherry tomato, the butternut squash, the charred courgette.The ultimate salad cheese is feta, not parmesan parmesan works with everything, whereas feta is like an awkward adolescent that keeps falling out with everyone, until it finally finds a youth club (cucumbers) where it can really be itself. I don’t think I’ve ever had a caper and thought “they shouldn’t have put this caper in”, nor an olive, nor any flat leaf parsley. Conversely, if anyone puts a nasturtium, or a peach, or any rosewater on my salad plate, to adapt the martial arts aphorism, if they could see on my face what I feel in my heart, nobody would ever do that twice.To return to those traditionalists: what if you want just leaves, some wholesome, winsome leaves, on their own, with no mucking about? I’d countenance most leaves except frisée chicory, which is bitter and looks like a librarian who hasn’t brushed their hair. Oh, sorry, and iceberg lettuce, which I’m nothing like as snobby about as most of the world, but it has to be served quartered and smothered in blue cheese dressing – that’s not a salad, it’s more of a fun gimmick.Otherwise, take some leaves – my all-time favourite is the butter lettuce, floppy and a bit nostalgic, the kind of thing Peter Rabbit would steal – and dress them in oil and vinegar mixed with salt and garlic that have been pounded in a 1:1 ratio. Perplexingly, this will feel like too much salt and too much garlic. It is an incredibly poky and moreish salad, which is delicious against anything – bread, ham, cheese, other vegetables, genuinely anything and sometimes makes people cough, but I don’t mind that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c08dc00a25bab47aaaca44d2c240645372546b0/0_227_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c112cde8f4170782415a0625aa280938","title":"where would you eat if you didnt have long to live","story":"A seriously ill reader asked for my restaurant recommendations. I posted them on Twitter and it brought out the best in everyoneEvery week I receive emails requesting restaurant recommendations. There are significant birthdays that need marking, cantankerous relatives who need placating. I try but don’t always manage to answer them all. The one I received at the end of May demanded an answer. Hugh Paton wanted my top 10 places in the UK not gastro palaces offering experiences that would stay with him for the rest of his life, because it turned out there wasn’t much of his life left. He had recently been given a terminal cancer diagnosis and was no longer in the business of creating memories. As he put it: “Going and eating a few decent meals strikes me as one good way to spend some of my remaining time.”I wrote him a list: the ramshackle Company Shed for bare-bones seafood on the Essex coast the vivid, live-fire cooking of Traköl on the Gateshead side of the Tyne the Game Bird at the Stafford Hotel in London for a bit of old-school British classicism, and so on. Because people like lists, I posted it to Twitter, explaining the context. The response was immense. People tweeted the restaurants they would go to in the same circumstances. They discussed the pleasures of a good meal in bad times. They celebrated the dishes that would most give them comfort.Touchingly, many of the restaurants then stepped up, offering Hugh and his other half, Anna, lunch on them. Emails flew back and forth. Introductions were made. At one point he emailed his thanks but said he might leave it a month or two until treatment was under way. I counselled him against that. I had recently lost one of my closest friends to a similar cancer and knew full well that while you hope for time, it’s not a commodity you can bank on. “Carpe diem and all that,” I said.He took my advice. “OK,” he wrote back, “carpe diem it is.” There were, by all accounts, wonderful meals at Margot and Rochelle Canteen at the ICA in London, and a trip to Parker’s Tavern in Cambridge, where a fire alarm forced them all out on to the street. Hugh was given a doorman’s plum-coloured coat against the chill, and was photographed in it, drink still in hand. He was the recipient of the kindness of strangers. But those three restaurants were all he managed. Hugh died towards the end of July, just two months after he first emailed me.Although we never met, other than via email, I came to like Hugh very much I admired his phlegmatic approach to the hand that life had dealt him. I especially appreciated his approach to restaurants. As far as he was concerned, they weren’t providing meals to be captured and pinned to a board like so many butterflies, stiffened with rigor mortis. They were about life lived firmly in the present tense.We are all of us prone to dwell on the future: on the job or relationship that will finally gift us the happiness we crave. But if you can afford it, a good meal, in a restaurant engineered to feed rather than impress, forces us into the now. And the now was exactly where Hugh needed to be. As Anna put it to me, after Hugh had died: “For the last time he could enjoy the taste, the ambience and the people who treated us with touching consideration.” It’s easy to dismiss a meal out as just lunch. It’s easy to see it as ephemeral. But sometimes, just sometimes, it can be so very much more.In memory of Hugh Paton, 1952-2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dde07014ae72cf8f90287a6c8c3def4894db134/0_60_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=874d86de945bd54319b687470d55c5b5","title":"how premier league footballers got woke","story":"Once renowned for luxury lifestyles and bad behaviour, players are speaking out on big issues from mental health to politicsThat’s not a politician, a columnist, or a “progressive lovey” with an Oscar on their bedside table. Those are the words of 24-year-old Arsenal footballer Héctor Bellerín – to his 1.65m followers on Twitter.It may seem like a small step, but for years footballers kept their views hidden: they certainly weren’t opining on human rights. Any charity work was confined to controversy-free causes, such as the annual trip to a children’s hospital. It was a chore that clubs utilised to generate positive PR. Yet today Bellerín is just the latest in an ever-increasing list of players speaking out on fraught political debates. From the Tottenham midfielder Eric Dier expressing his support for remain, to Danny Rose opening up about his struggles with mental health, and Raheem Sterling’s bold retort to racists – young stars are showing they have interests far beyond PlayStation and nights at Mahiki. What changed?“We are just normal people,” says the Nottingham Forest winger Joe Lolley. “We express our opinions the same way actors, authors, factory workers and single mothers are all inclined to do.” He credits some of the increase to social media – “we’re given a platform to express our views” – but the former England and Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux doesn’t believe it’s quite that simple. “There’s not one thing that’s been a catalyst for change,” he says. “You have to look at society as a whole, the work that is being done around ersity, equality, respecting iniduals – football has benefited from that. We’ve moved away from this macho image of what it is to be a man, the idea that you shouldn’t show emotion or ‘weakness’.” The support Rose was given by both club and country is testament to that, as is the positive reaction to the Watford striker Troy Deeney’s confession of his own struggles.Le Saux could have done with that sort of support when he started out as a young pro. “People used to plough on through the emotional turmoil for fear of appearing weak,” he says. “The dressing room in my era was tough. I learned very quickly to keep my personal life to myself at Chelsea.” Even the biggest events of his life were kept hidden so he could maintain the image that he felt was required. “I didn’t tell people about my mother’s death, and I was 13 at the time, because I thought people would see it as a weakness and might use it as a way to have a dig at me.”Of course, some never had the option to hide away. If the first professional black players weren’t addressing issues of racism head on in quite the same way that Sterling did when he called out newspapers for helping to fuel racism on the terraces, their very presence was a political statement.In 1978, Instagram didn’t exist. If Laurie Cunningham, Brendon Batson and Cyrille Regis – the trio of black West Bromwich Albion stars affectionally known as the Three Degrees – had reacted to the monkey chants from the terraces by lambasting the media for “fuelling racism”, like Sterling, it would not have been applauded. “It’s important to look at what stopped footballers from speaking out in previous eras,” says football and politics writer Nooruddean Choudry. “Despite the adulation and fame they received, they didn’t really have any power. That was all in the boardrooms. So if they did say something outspoken or contentious, they risked everything. The balance has shifted now. Modern footballers have more power, and there’s less risk. They can say how they feel without it jeopardising their livelihood or their dreams.”But the sight of three black players on the same side for the first time still sent a message. As Batson said when the trio were honoured with a statue in 2012: “We didn’t go out of our way to be role models, it’s something that happened naturally … It’s a recognition of black players from my era who had to put up with a lot more than the current players have to.” Racism on the stands may have roared back into the headlines last season – a banana thrown at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang by Spurs fans as they played at Arsenal, or the Muslim Liverpool player Mo Salah being called a “bomber” by Chelsea supporters – but it would be wrong to say that things haven’t dramatically improved since the 1970s, and the bravery of those pioneering pros played a huge part in that.That was on display again recently when Manchester City’s Catalan manager, Pep Guardiola, was asked about the prospect of being the first side to win a historic domestic treble. He was quick to point out that was only true of the men’s game: “The women, they have already done it.” Acknowledging that the women’s game exists and lauding its triumphs should not be radical, but it says something about the low expectations we have of those involved in football that he was quickly praised for it. “I thought it was magnificent and utter class,” says the Juventus and England forward Lianne Sanderson.Footballers are heroes to hundreds of thousands of young people and by talking about abortion, race or LGBT issues, they can frame the debate. It’s a power that they’re well aware of. “Since footballers have such a large social media presence, we can shape the conversation as much as you do,” Deeney told this paper. And that’s ignoring their financial might – it has been suggested that an investment by former Arsenal, Milan and Crystal Palace player, Mathieu Flamini, in a biochemical firm could help to save the planet.Flamini recognises, and welcomes, the power players have to “influence the next generation”. It’s something that Lolley, with his regular interventions on politics, is well aware of. “Those with such high standing in the game have a chance to push for change. It gets people talking about major issues. And it’s then a snowball effect, once a few are able to come out and talk comfortably, it gives the freedom for others to voice their opinions that they were probably too scared to do before.”None of this is to say that footballers of the past never expressed progressive political positions. “There have always been socially conscious footballers, from Shankly and Sócrates to Boban and Cantona, but it was generally when they were established in their careers,” says Choudry. The former Barcelona defender Oleguer was well known for his leftwing, pro-Catalan independence views – and was even dropped by a sponsor for an article he wrote in 2007 questioning the independence of the Spanish judicial system. In the UK, Robbie Fowler was fined by Uefa, European football’s governing body, in 1997 for expressing his support for the Liverpool dockers on a T-shirt when celebrating a goal. Political demonstrations were, and are, outlawed on the pitch. “Players have always had an opinion,” says Sanderson. “It depends if the club would let you express it. That’s why a lot of them sound robotic.”But that wasn’t the only time Fowler was fined for behaviour on the pitch. The striker also perpetrated one of the most notorious incidents of homophobic abuse in football, when he taunted Le Saux in 1999 by bending over and gesturing to his rear end. Fowler took years to properly apologise, even though they had to share a dressing room for England. “I did not want a public apology, just a private word would do,” Le Saux wrote in 2007. “But he refused. He said that he had done nothing wrong, that it was just a bit of a laugh.”And that’s the thing. Footballers are people, as complex and capable of contradiction as anybody else in society. Someone can express welcome working-class solidarity while at the same time holding unpleasant, bigoted views. “It’s telling that Nike backed Colin Kaepernick and amplified his stance,” says Choudry about the American footballer’s on-field protests at the treatment of minorities in the US. “In a way, that legitimises the voices of young athletes who aren’t willing to remain silent on things that matter to them.”“Difference is celebrated now,” says Le Saux. “Players have inidual needs, whether it be recovery drinks, gym programmes or politics. Until you are really yourself, you can’t be the best version of you. The work of a club becomes not about sculpting the best footballer, but the best person. Whether they leave the game at 15 or 35, it’s how they then contribute to society on which a club can be judged.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253da723ae2d949c75a1d896058edcad7db24c3e/0_90_3426_2055/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=225d6110eab8a7a8d2a87b66aac86123","title":"wolves pyunik europa league qualifying match report","story":"After over-running modest Armenian visitors here, Wolves will begin duelling next week with Torino for a place in the Europa League group stage. That is when things will get wonderfully serious this was an entertaining breeze. Nuno Espírito Santo and nearly 30,000 fans watched with glee as a youthful Wolves side completed an 8-0 aggregate win over Pyunik thanks mainly to a thrilling 10-minute spell in the second half.Fringe players came to the fore, suggesting that one of the Premier League’s smallest squads has encouraging strength in depth. Pedro Neto and Morgan Gibbs-White struck their first goals for the club before Ruben Vinagre rounded off a fine move to claim another. Diogo Jota came off the bench to add a spectacular fourth.The fact that Molineux was close to capacity reflected Wolves’ fans enthusiasm for their club’s first campaign in a major continental competition for nearly four decades. There will be a full house in a fortnight when they host Torino for the second leg of their play-off following next Thursday’s first leg in Italy. Wolves are unlikely to have come back from that with as comfortable a lead as they had here. Their 4-0 win in Armenia meant they went into this match with not so much a cushion as a chaise longue but Nuno did his bit for diplomacy by insisting that the Armenian side could not be taken lightly. If hubris is best avoided, so too are injuries, especially before a gruelling series of matches, and that is why Nuno began with an unfamiliar lineup.Monday’s Premier League duel with Manchester United is the first of five matches in 14 days for Wolves, including the two-legged showdown with Torino, so Nuno made nine alterations to the side that kicked off their domestic campaign with a draw at Leicester last Saturday. Three summer signings made their first starts for the club, two of them forming the strike force. Neto, a 19-year-old Portuguese forward who joined from Lazio for £16m, impressed the most but his new strike partner, the 21-year-old Italian Patrick Cutrone, also caught the eye.At the back Jesus Vallejo, who joined on loan from Real Madrid after captaining Spain’s U-21s to victory in this summer’s European Championship, started in central defence. That rearguard also included Max Kilman, a 22-year-old making his first senior start for Wolves – his prior international experience consisted of 25 caps for England’s futsal team.The home crowd were in good voice, excited by the prospect of a memorable European campaign. They could even have convinced themselves that Pyunik, clad all in white, were Real Madrid until, that is, the visitors started playing. Though capable of dainty one-touch stuff, Pyunik offered no penetration and little physical presence. After 10 minutes of tippy-tappy tedium Wolves raised the tempo and nearly took the lead.Neto was the instigator, turning smartly on the right before charging towards the box and drilling a low shot just wide. Cutrone went close moments later, blasting a volley a yard over after a Wolves corner triggered chaos in the visitors’ area. Neto, pleasingly busy throughout, should have done better in the 20th minute when the ball broke to him at the edge of the area and he curled a first-time shot into the Stan Cullis Stand. One minute later Romain Saïss tried to show him how it’s done but his free-kick from 20 yards brushed past the post.Wolves killed off the tie with three well worked goals in 10 minutes. Neto scored the first, tapping in from close range after a low pass across the face of goal by Cutrone. Then Neto matched that service by providing a perfect cross from the left for Gibbs-White. The 19-year-old arrived at speed to slam in his first goal for Wolves from close range. Adama Traoré set up the third with a storming run from the right and – all too rare from him – a good final pass from the byline. Cutrone helped it on to Vinagre for another close-range finish.Jota and Raul Jiménez came off the bench to give a reminder of why they are Wolves’ first-choice strikers, Jiménez providing a lovely looping pass that Jota volleyed wonderfully into the net from 10 yards. “It is a pity that Wolves play Torino next because both those teams belong in the group stage,” said Pyunik’s manager, Alexander Tarkhanov, nicely setting up next week’s duel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec710aa008fd8975f08fba8016b590612930472/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60cacac61bf6a73ba8aa88dd53dfe6cd","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"There are a few potential debuts on the cards, while a Southampton defender deserves praise for his charitable actionsArsenal began the season with an uncharacteristically efficient away win. Their first home match could be an attacking extravaganza if, unlike at Newcastle, Nicolas Pépé and Alexandre Lacazette start with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. But their defence will also be worth watching, especially if David Luiz makes his debut. He would probably prefer if it were not against Ashley Barnes. The forward riled the Brazilian to distraction when Burnley drew 2-2 at Chelsea in April. Barnes is one of the slyest pests in the Premier League and he continually lures David Luiz into fouling him. David Luiz got so frustrated with the way Barnes and Chris Wood wound him up that he perpetrated an embarrassing e, which did not stop him from complaining afterwards about Burnley’s “anti-football”. Barnes, you fancy, will be hoping Unai Emery picks his new signing. PDManchester City will have revenge for last season’s Champions League quarter-final defeat on their minds when they entertain Tottenham. Signed from Juventus during the summer but yet to play a competitive match for City, João Cancelo could feature. Nominally a right-back, City fans are unlikely to see much of him in that particular area of the pitch if the smoke blown up the Portuguese 25-year-old’s nether regions this week is anything to go by. “Cancelo is perfect for City,” said Gary Neville, who managed the player during his ill-fated spell in charge of Valencia. “He’s a winger, a goalscorer, assist maker, he’s a right-back! You’re going to lose a bit defensively in terms of a back four because he’ll never be there, I promise you that.” Should he get selected, an already mouthwatering match-up will be that little bit more exciting. BGWest Ham’s failings against Manchester City were predictable. Their full-backs were exposed, their midfield was too lightweight and although it might seem harsh to be critical after a defeat by Pep Guardiola’s side, the problem for Manuel Pellegrini is that other teams will think that they can hurt West Ham in similar ways. For all their attacking flair they remain too easy to beat and Pellegrini needs his forwards to work harder. City’s opening goal stemmed from Michail Antonio failing to protect Aaron Cresswell at left-back, while there is a feeling within the club that playing Manuel Lanzini and Jack Wilshere in the same midfield gives Declan Rice too much to do in front of the back four. Yet Pellegrini is determined to play on the front foot and it would be out of character for him to shut up shop at Brighton, who began the Graham Potter era with a 3-0 win over Watford. Ultimately Pellegrini does not have many ways to tighten his midfield – he is one injury away from having to start Carlos Sánchez – so it could be a case of West Ham trying to emulate the Ossie Ardiles approach. JSMuch was made of the fee Aston Villa paid Bournemouth for Tyrone Mings this summer – Dean Smith’s side could end up coughing up £26.5m including performance-related clauses – but the defender has a chance to show what his former club are missing. The challenge of shackling ex-teammates Joshua King and Callum Wilson, strikers blessed with searing pace, is arguably as tough as any he will face this season. Mings was desperate to return, turning up at Bournemouth station in full kit the day after the play-off final victory over Derby and he made an impressive start at Tottenham and is determined to prove he is capable of excelling in the top flight alongside fellow summer signing Bjorn Engels, who Smith previously tried to sign at Brentford. “I had a click with Tyrone from the first moment we played together,” Engels said. BFThe games are coming thick and fast for Frank Lampard, who has yet to register a win as Chelsea manager but can take encouragement from his side’s performances in varying degrees of defeat at the hands of Manchester United and Liverpool. While he could do with an easier game to get a win, Leicester should prove very tricky opposition. In Brendan Rodgers, they are managed by a man who would have been ideally suited to the Chelsea job had he not been in such a rush to leave Celtic. While it is far too soon to write off Tammy Abraham’s chances of hacking it at the highest level, the very early omens are not great. His failure to convert an excellent chance at Manchester United, followed by that missed penalty in the shoot-out against Liverpool will only ramp up the pressure on the striker. He deserves a run in the team to prove his worth, but will his manager’s need for a win and the proven goalscorer prompt Lampard to give Olivier Giroud the nod? BGHow much credit should Norwich really take from a 4-1 defeat? There were glimmers of encouragement against Liverpool from the four academy graduates who started to the manner in which they carved open the best defence in the Premier League last season on several occasions. Teemu Pukki proved he can cause problems – and find the net – but a naivety in defence ultimately rendered any green shoots worthless at Anfield. A return to Carrow Road against a Newcastle side in transition should act as a better barometer of the kind of season in store. “We know it is Everest again without the tools but let’s see the outcome,” said Daniel Farke. “We know in every game we are the underdog. We play with a very young side and we don’t have the financial opportunities of other teams.” BFEverton are unbeaten in their past 13 home matches against Watford, a record they look set to extend unless Javi Gracia’s side up their game considerably in the wake of last weekend’s emphatic defeat at the hands of Brighton. Following his dismissal during Everton’s draw against Crystal Palace, Morgan Schneiderlin will miss this game, while his fellow midfielder André Gomes could miss out through injury. While he returned to training this week following a groin injury, there will be obvious concerns over Fabian Delph’s fitness. In the absence of this trio, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Tom Davies are Everton’s only fit central midfielders. A £25m signing from Mainz, Gbamin could make his full debut. A tough-tackling defensive midfielder brought in to replace Idrissa Gueye, by his own account Gbamin likes “to go in the duels, run a lot and tackle”. While he may have to be thrown into the starting lineup sooner than his manager, Marco Silva, might like, Everton fans could get a decent look at their latest acquisition . BGManchester United’s big win over Chelsea was a little misleading, insofar as Frank Lampard’s side ultimately played to United’s counter-attacking strengths. Wolves will not. They beat United twice at Molineux earlier this year and are slick enough to do so again. The visitors showed signs of getting to grips with Wolves in the second of those matches: after being outplayed in the first, Ole Gunnar Solskjær changed to a back-three formation and United began with great energy, dominating in midfield and out wide. But once Wolves fought back, United crumbled. Do they have more midfield mettle now? We shall see. At least they should be stronger in central defence: Raul Jiménez bullied and outwitted United’s defenders last season Harry Maguire will be asked to do something about that.

The fact Frank Lampard is in charge, a man with so much goodwill from his time at Chelsea as a player, will buy the team a little time but what are the minimum expectations? I feel winning the Super Cup against such established, strong opponents would have made this season an overnight success. A good season for Lampard was only just out of reach – like a couple of the penalties Kepa Arrizabalaga got a hand to but couldn’t quite keep out.Manchester United away and Liverpool in the Super Cup was a hell of a start for Lampard but now the real work starts: Leicester in a televised game on Sunday, followed by Norwich away and Sheffield United at home. It wasn’t necessarily a disaster if he lost his first two games but now there will be expectation: a bare minimum of six points from the next three games, or a the honeymoon mood will start to change.His team selection for that opening game at Old Trafford made a statement. N’Golo Kanté, Olivier Giroud and Marcos Alonso were on the bench Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham were in the side and a line was drawn between Chelsea’s new manager and his predecessors. It wasn’t just a team sheet, it was a manifesto: the new man in the dugout believes in youth and will give young players a chance.New managers often like to make big statements right out of the gate and this was certainly one of those. But it’s one thing being a manager who is willing to pick young players, and another one playing them all in the first game of the season. For me it was not strictly necessary and when I saw the names of some of the substitutes I was surprised.Kanté was the PFA and Football Writers’ player of the year the last time Chelsea won the league he and Giroud are both World Cup winners Alonso has played at least 30 games a season in each of the three years since he joined from Fiorentina and been a vital part of the team under successive managers. There is normally a reason why players are experienced and successful, and I felt Lampard should have been concentrating on building a solid, winning team rather than on making statements about his managerial philosophy. You can have faith in your best young players and demonstrate that to them and to your fans without necessarily starting them all at Old Trafford on the opening day.The last time Chelsea appointed an inexperienced but popular former player in the hope he could win over their fans and unite the club was in 2012, when Roberto Di Matteo got the job and the first thing he did was drop Lampard and Didier Drogba for his first game. Now Lampard was in the dugout, and seemed to be following in the same vein.The starting XI in Istanbul were a little different, with Giroud back in the attack and Kanté outstanding in midfield. Lampard’s comments after the game suggested the midfielder, at least, will be a key part of the team this season. He can be crucial in helping the less experienced players around him to shine and I think Giroud can do a similar job with Abraham. The 21-year-old could be great, and has got everything to be a top striker. He has the physique, he can finish, but Chelsea are at a different level to the clubs he has played for on loan and he is still young. He needs time to develop his craft, and in Giroud there is a player at the club who has been there and done it.Perhaps when he picked his first team Lampard was focusing on the Super Cup and the opportunity to win some silverware, or maybe he was not worried about the consequences of defeat. Lampard has been promised time to bring through young players and build a successful team. The big question is, how much time? What does time even mean, in football these days? People talk about it a lot, but when you say you’re going to give someone time, is that five games? Ten? Promises are easy to make in the summer but a couple more defeats now and I guarantee that some will start to get fidgety.The bottom line is that Chelsea fans, as much as they want to see Lampard succeed, have been used to success for a long time. To get supporters and the top people at the club to shift their expectations is also going to take time. Chelsea have been a club that spends on transfers and expects instant results from teams full of experience. Lampard is going to oversee a shift in that DNA. It may prove harder than expected. He is loved at the club but if he doesn’t turn good performances into victories how long will it be before the fans start saying to themselves: “OK, it’s Frank Lampard, we are playing well but we’d still like to win.”The fact Manchester City and Liverpool are so good is helpful for Lampard. He is the first Chelsea manager for some time who is not expected to challenge for the title in his first season. In that sense there is less pressure on him than there was on Maurizio Sarri a year ago. Eden Hazard, their best and most creative player, has left, there is a transfer ban in place, the champions are out of reach and he arrives with an enormous fund of goodwill carried over from his playing days. All of this has helped to generate realism and positivity but fans are fickle. Despite its youth my sense is that the squad are good enough to finish in the top four. The performance against Liverpool was extremely encouraging now I hope for results."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54f98567da018155804d83b806fbdeee42c717d/0_397_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2b8ea654a9cf8051479bdaa533f3631","title":"walter chandoha cats in pictures","story":"In 1949, Walter Chandoha adopted a stray kitten in New York.

The question arises after a timely welter of reports suggesting just that. Over the past fortnight, there has been a marked uptick in the number of off-the-record briefings suggesting that the Duke and Duchess of York are rekindling their union, which was memorably sundered in the annus horribilis of 1992.It’s funny what brings once-parted couples back together – be it shared interests, a sense of unfinished business, or simply the chance to distract from an international sex-trafficking scandal to which you’ve been linked. I will find space for the duke’s strong denial of all this unpleasantness a bit further down the article.At some level, you do have to doff your fascinator to Fergs, whose unerring, Teflon-coated ability to find new revenue streams no matter how many financial scandals she’s been involved in has never once stopped a certain type of royal-watcher cooing how unfairly she’s been treated. The ongoing injustice now plays out on her Instagram, with a recent post detailing the vicissitudes of a joint luxury stay in the Bahrain Ritz Carlton as guest of the cuddly crown prince. “Such a joy to be invited to attend the Bahrain Grand Prix with @hrhthedukeofyork and Beatrice,” wibbled Fergie. “Excited to meet @frankiedettori_ #familytimes @f1 #luckyme.” Not sure luck has a whole lot to do with it, but there we go.Back to the present, and Andrew and Fergie have until recently been holed up with the Queen at Balmoral. Last Sunday, Andrew rode in the car next to Her Maj on the way to church (do me a favour), beaming all the way like a 59-year-old man who feels almost sure that his mother represents a lack of consequences for him. Which, let’s face it, you wouldn’t rule out. So yes, until a couple of days ago, Balmoral was Andrew’s physical location. But where’s he at, mentally? According to the Sun: “Royal insiders have revealed that Andrew is starting to ‘s*** himself’ over renewed attention.” I can’t help feeling this is one of those occasions where we really need to know what type of “royal insider” is being quoted on the shitting-himself front. Is this a) one of those made-up ones who talks exactly like a Sun journalist, b) just another of the myriad hangers-on who tittle-tattle for cash, or c) one of the retinue of servants charged with physically changing Andrew’s sheets? By rights, he should be at (c) stage, given that it was some Buckingham Palace flunky’s job last week to issue a statement reading: “Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.” No doubt this is the sort of misunderstanding that could befall anyone. I mean, who among us? WHO AMONG US?Either way, Andrew left Scotland by private jet earlier in the week. He has since boarded his second private jet in just a few days, along with Fergie, who we learn has whisked him away to a Spanish hideaway in Sotogrande. The Sun’s headline showing pictures of the pair being driven away from the Malaga runway is “FERGIE TIME”, reminding us that in the royal family, there is always a bit extra to get what you need.Indeed, the general standard of refereeing of these people is completely biased. How else to explain that even with this level of WTF-ery, the villain of the royal piece remains Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex? Far more time and column inches is already being devoted to fuming about the private jet that took Prince Harry and Meghan took to Ibiza last weekend for her birthday. Guys! Yoo-hoo! You’re looking at the wrong private jet! If you need help prioritising your royal private jets, here’s a simple way to do it: one’s got Meghan in, and the other’s precious cargo is a prince who has been linked to an international underage sex-trafficking scandal. Alas, we always look the wrong way in this country. And, indeed, when we are on tour, as travelling blister Nigel Farage proved in Australia this week. As reported by the , Nigel gave a speech to Sydney’s Conservative Political Action Conference, where his big targets were Meghan and Harry, and the Queen Mother (dead), who Nigel described as a “chain-smoking gin drinker”. Nigel Farage having a go at someone for liking a drink and a fag, is it? Very good.Or take the Mail’s Sarah Vine, whose rolling anger at Meghan feels much more a matter for her therapist than her newspaper column readers. I don’t want to diagnose projection at a distance but perhaps a well-meaning friend of Sarah’s might point out that she and Meghan have so much more in common that she has thus far acknowledged. They are both married to people about sixth in line to their respective thrones. Both have been accused of grandeur: during the Tory leadership contest in the immediate wake of the EU referendum, a misdirected email of Sarah’s revealed her reminding her husband that “DacreMurdoch instinctively dislike Boris but trust your ability enough to support a Boris-Gove ticket”. Both have been lazily cast as pushy wives urging their husbands on. And, in the final analysis, we taxpayers were billed for far more of both of their interior decoration schemes than feels reasonable.Still, plenty more Meghan misdemeanours to fuss over, no doubt, while Andrew hides away in his hideaway. As the duke himself once remarked: “I could have worse tags than ‘Airmiles Andy’ – although I don’t know what they are.”It is always a pleasure to hear from the cinematic personage of Gerard Butler, an actor absolutely committed to taking himself entirely seriously. As, indeed, he should. Even the summaries of Gerard Butler movies are a good indication of the delights contained therein. “Gerard Butler plays a conflicted cop.” “Gerard Butler plays a US submarine commander.” “Gerard Butler plays the world’s leading meteorologist”.Gerard Butler is currently promoting Angel Has Fallen, the third part of a trilogy already comprising Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen (“Gerard Butler plays a Secret Service Agent”). And in the course of the interview circuit, we have been encouraged to rue the movie summary that never was. Namely, why we have never seen the words: “Gerard Butler plays James Bond.”“Listen,” entreated Gerard of Capital FM listeners this week. “Here’s the thing. You know what I love? I love Bond, I grew up on Bond but the cool thing with this is, we created our own franchise.”Quite. If asked to name a more iconic franchise than Bond, I would certainly say the Something Has Fallen trilogy. As would Gerard.“We created our own Bond,” he explains, “and that’s more fun than to have to play Bond, and be compared to the others like ‘he’s not as good as him’, ‘better than him’, ‘no, nobody ever beats Roger Moore’, ‘oh Sean Connery …’ I won’t ever have to go through that.”The luckiest of escapes for everyone but cinema lovers, then, and we look forward to seeing which role Gerard will next inhabit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e4b9fbfea28580405ea356b74ead651ac90777/0_4_2716_1629/master/2716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92e007bbe74dc8cd9600d4db7e632156","title":"stormzy to fund two more cambridge students","story":"Grime artist to pay tuition fees for more undergraduates from minority ethnic backgroundsStormzy has announced he will cover the costs of two more black undergraduate students at Cambridge University in the next academic year until the completion of their degree course.The grime artist will pay the tuition fees and maintenance grants of the students from September as part of the Stormzy Scholarship, which funded the studies of two black Cambridge students for the first time last year.The scheme is aimed at supporting people from minority backgrounds who have earned a place at the University of Cambridge. It is hoped the scheme will help address the relatively low number of minority ethnic students who attend Oxbridge institutions.So far Stormzy, who recently headlined Glastonbury, has been funding the cost of the scholarships himself. It is hoped that other funding methods can be found in future to continue the programme with the help of outside investors.The identities of the students supported by the scheme have been kept secret to ensure they have a normal life during their studies, although Stormzy keeps track of their academic progress.On Thursday, Stormzy singled out an east London school for praise after 100 pupils there achieved straight As in their A-levels. After the school tweeted of an “absolutely electric” atmosphere after the record results, Stormzy tweeted: “I don’t even know where Brampton Manor is but my kids will be going there.”Almost all the 41 students from the school who gained places at Oxford and Cambridge are from minority ethnic backgrounds and half were on free school meals.“We are really, really proud of our students.

We survey a new archive box set – in full – to uncover the real story of these ‘three days of peace and music’A few weeks back, my Twitter feed was suddenly clogged with misty-eyed reminiscences of Live Aid. It is now generally regarded as a white saviour festival of mostly dreadful music. Still, there’s much nostalgic love for Tony Hadley’s leather trench coat, and Queen’s alarming “no time for losers” philosophy. I lived through it I remembered how a bunch of craven, ageing rock stars fell over themselves to reboot their careers. OK, I was 21, and cynical, but I was there for it, watching it all unfold on TV. I understand it.Woodstock – which celebrates its 50th anniversary this weekend – was a primitive blueprint for Live Aid, and every mega-festival since. Its cultural weight has risen and fallen over the decades – depending on who you talk to, it was either the pinnacle of 1960s counterculture or the rain-sodden end of a dream. I was four years old. The soundtrack album would be in friends’ houses in the 70s, and the movie seemed to be on TV every year, so I’m part of a generation that thinks it knows Woodstock without having been there. But the movie is incomplete and out of sequence – some of the story is as fictionalised as Bohemian Rhapsody.Out this month is a 50th anniversary archive box set – all 38 CDs of it – which presents the festival in something approximating real time. Folk-blues singer Richie Havens, who opened the event while almost every other act was stuck in traffic, would later claim he “played for nearly three hours … I sang every song I knew!” We now know he only played for 45 minutes. This is an audio vérité documentary, right down to the on-stage announcements: “Eric Klinnenberg, please call home … Dennis Dache, please call your wife … Karen from Poughkeepsie, please meet Harold at the stand with the blood pills …” I listened to all 38 discs in sequence, over three days.“Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most beautiful men in the whole world” is the opening introduction for Havens. “Groovy, groovy, groovy. How are you? Can you hear? Groovy. Groovy. It’s really beautiful to see so many people together. Right? Groovy.” So you may not have the Beatles at Woodstock (or Bob Dylan, who lived within spitting distance) but you do have Havens singing Strawberry Fields Forever as if it had been written in a shack. Havens goes into the terrific Freedom for an encore, which will turn out to be a highlight of the movie its chopped guitar and conga slaps pre-empt late 90s R\u0026ampB. Sweetwater, meanwhile, sound like a late-60s parody band they even take time out to tell us they were busted on the way over. Their set is rescued by the lovely For Pete’s Sake, a “bossa nova blues” vocalese with harpsichord.Someone should have told Bert Sommer that, like Cilla Black, his softer register was very sweet, but singing out he resembled a goat caught on barbed wire. Tim Hardin – writer of the immortal Reason to Believe – pulls off the opposite trick: singing out, he still sounds intimate, and though his tuning is wayward, his bruised set is a highlight. We’re only four discs in, and deadpan stage manager John Morris is already telling the “same boring pedantic speech” about not climbing on the scaffolding. The flat, brown acid gets him more exercised: “Everybody please, please … it is poison. There are 15 people who are very ill from it …” Rain is pouring down.“Friends, we begin this evening’s recital …” Ravi Shankar had blown minds at the Monterey pop festival two years previously, when Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band was only a couple of weeks old. His set already feels like reliving the past, but it has the best sound so far. Thanks to the rain, the electrical setup is life-threatening, so the unbilled Melanie takes the stage with her acoustic guitar: Close to It All and Momma Momma are truly intense. Animal Crackers is not only intentionally amateurish but deliberately ugly. We need someone to lift us up.What we hear next is Joe Boyd refusing Morris’s request for the Incredible String Band to go on in the rain with just a couple of acoustic guitars, thereby missing their shot at future immortality. Instead, the unknown Arlo Guthrie takes the stage, ending up in the movie, and – through sheer bonhomie – selling a million copies of Alice’s Restaurant. Joan Baez’s late Friday night appearance, oddly out of time, gives away that Woodstock is a celebration of the 60s before the decade has even ended.“Let’s get high!” say Quill, Saturday’s opening act and maybe the most obscure name on the bill. They are also awful. They Live The Life lasts a leaden, eight minutes, ending in a percussive wig out with the band sarcastically chanting: “You’re so free!” This was played during one of the brief sunny spells, but you wouldn’t know it.San Francisco veteran Country Joe McDonald is melancholy and sweet. Santana’s lithe Latin groove is maybe the first thing that doesn’t sound actively damp. The 21-year-old Carlos Santana has apparently been given mescaline by the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia long before his scheduled set time. Years later, he laughed about it: “I figured I had enough time to come down before it was time for us to play.” But no, because everything is running on Woodstock time, and they go on early, the guitar wriggling like a snake in his hand. You can’t tell – they sound great. Weeks later, Evil Ways will be in the Top 10.By mid-afternoon, insulin and asthma medicine are the main concerns of the MC. And lost car keys. The Lovin’ Spoonful’s John Sebastian walks on stage, slack-jawed. “I don’t know if you can tell how amazing you look. You’re a whole city. You’re something an awful lot of us talked about 10 years ago.” Sebastian adds that he’s been living in California, in a tent, where he met a lady who tie-dyes – “a cloth house is all you need if you’ve got love.” The beautiful Darling Be Home Soon is the only hit single we’ve heard so far. Sebastian goes down better than anyone yet, maybe something to do with the brevity of his set. He plays Younger Generation (“I’d like to dedicate it to a cat whose old lady has just had a baby”) and the lyric still sounds ridiculously grownup, more so than Bowie’s Kooks, coming from a man in his early 20s.“At the information booth is a three-year-old girl, we don’t know her name, she has light blond hair …” There’s a constant whirr of helicopters before the bludgeoning jazz rock of England’s Keef Hartley Band, who are greeted by one person clapping. By now, the army are flying in medical supplies in helicopters. “They’re with us, man, they’re not against us!” cries lighting man and new MC Chip Monck – amid the chaos, the MCs are notably dropping their wink-wink references to getting high.The Incredible String Band are very much not bludgeoning. “Hello. I’m going to read a poem before we start.” They sound apologetic yet slightly grouchy. They could have created an indelible moment for Michael Wadleigh’s cameras the previous night instead they go on at teatime before festival-friendly Canned Heat and play a set consisting entirely of new songs. Canned Heat, at their best, sound like a proletarian Velvet Underground (Rollin’ Blues), or maybe the American Status Quo (the endless Woodstock Boogie). Going Up the Country will become the festival’s anthem, as well as a TV ad staple decades later.Mountain? More brutal white blues shouting, more ear-squashingly heavy boogie. Night falls and on come the Grateful Dead, who begin with St Stephen, a pretty song, largely instrumental, that clocks in at two minutes, and follow it with country classic Mama Tried. Garcia, like a proto-Alan Partridge, jokes about “designated parking areas” for 10 minutes while they try to sort out their sound. The 19 meandering minutes of Dark Star are attractive enough but, man, they go on, while poor Creedence Clearwater Revival – headliners, with Bad Moon Rising still in the charts – are watching the clock tick in the wings. Eventually they go on at 3 am.Creedence’s set is all the more remarkable given the ungodly hour. Fogerty’s voice is raw but focused, they can stretch out on Born on the Bayou and Suzie Q, but can be succinct, punchy and still just as evocatively swampy on Green River. They have punch – this is easily the best set so far.Janis Joplin sounds unerringly like Ray Stevens’ Bridget the Midget in places. While Raise Your Hand is a pretty undeniable Stax-on-helium workout, her version of the Bee Gees’ To Love Somebody is overegged. By contrast, Sly and the Family Stone sound entirely futuristic – like everyone else they have malfunctioning gear, but they “hurry up and play to avoid hanging you up”. Bang! Straight into Sing a Simple Song. Tight as a drum. Everyday People, a No 1 hit just a few weeks earlier, is a festival high point.Coming on stage at sunrise on the Sunday, Jefferson Airplane greet the new day explaining they’re not a “hippie band” but “manic morning music”, then eviscerate Fred Neil’s Other Side of Life. Somebody to Love is also taken at breakneck speed – this turns out to be an energy tablet before a leaden day. Joe Cocker does Dylan and Ray Charles with added sweat and grease, before another rainstorm means the power is cut for several hours. There is a beautiful – though shorter – ambient interlude on the box set.Crosby, Stills, Nash \u0026amp Young are balm. Fresh from the Hollies, Graham Nash shows his working men’s club stagecraft by crying, “Ooh, me zip’s come down!” just before the gorgeous Guinnevere. They sound like a cool freshwater stream alive with trout after the clogged, dead mud that has preceded them. It’s back to the wailin’ harp and high-wattage white blues with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, though at least they start with a cowbell-led groove on Born Under a Bad Sign. They have read their audience – Everything’s Gonna Be Alright is a proper party tune.Almost there. It’s breakfast time on Monday, and the crowds are audibly smaller. Fifties revivalists Sha Na Na sound like a less together Showaddywaddy. And finally, Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsies – or Gypsy Sun and Rainbows – play their first-ever show, for two hours, and it is blindingly great. How did the stage sound suddenly get this good? Hendrix is hilarious, as ever, explaining new song Izabella is “about a cat, blah blah, woof woof …” It’s a real shame they wouldn’t keep this lineup together. Hendrix repeatedly comments on the “patience” of the crowd. He plays the national anthem, his guitar e-bombs at the end of Hey Joe and, that’s your lot. The applause dies away surprisingly quickly.What do you learn from listening to Woodstock in almost-real time? That monumentally heavy, white-blues boogie was massive in America in 1969. That the relative finesse of Crosby, Stills, Nash \u0026amp Young and even Melanie was the obvious next move for rock, if only as relief and release. That Sly and the Family Stone were the best new act of the year and created a whole universe for R\u0026ampB. You wouldn’t really guess that a Peanuts character would be named after Woodstock, or that it would be used as shorthand for the counterculture 60s (1967’s Monterey festival would be more appropriate). But I do understand – now even more – why the footage and the soundtrack completely turned me off festivals as a teenager. It sounds like a battle, and sometimes it’s almost frightening.

Bowie, then living with landlady Mary Finnigan in Beckenham, had just released his first hit single, Space Oddity.The hope was that the festival, in the Croydon Road recreation ground where the bandstand has stood since 1905, would raise money for a permanent base for his and Finnigan’s Beckenham Arts Lab project, based in the nearby Three Tuns pub.The festival inspired Bowie to write Memory of a Free Festival for his second album released later that same year, and it has been suggested that he penned the lyrics to Life on Mars from the bandstand’s steps.After that August day when, Bowie’s lyrics record, “The children of the summer’s end gathered in the dampened grass”, the bandstand fell into disrepair.It is now being renovated, with the costs being met partly through the local council and through fundraising at an annual festival. Held over several years in the same park and now known as Bowie’s Beckenham Oddity festival, it celebrates the life and legacy of the star, who died of cancer in January 2016, aged 69.On Saturday, to mark the 50th anniversary of the event, some of the original lineup are returning,Singer-songwriter and acoustic guitarist, Keith Christmas, 72, who performed then, recalled: “I was 21, and David Bowie was around the same age, and it was a very idealistic time. I thought it was quite a cold day, but everyone else says it was a warm day, so that gives you an idea of how much I remember.“But I remember the bandstand. And in those days we perched on these high stools. If you look at some of the photos you can see that there is a large bar stool. It was meant to look cool. But you couldn’t get comfortable. You’ve got one leg stuck out, one leg stuck in, and you can’t keep time with your foot properly.“I did my thing. And David did his. I don’t think anyone thought anything of it, but then no one thought he was going to be a global phenomenon,” he said.“I reckon there were about 100 there. It was a sparsely attended crowd but very nice and laid back.”Christmas played on the Space Oddity album. During his career he also supported acts including the Who, King Crimson and the Kinks, and performed at the first Glastonbury in 1970. After later becoming a teacher, he has returned to music in his retirement, with a new album Life, Life out in September, and will perform on Saturday playing the same Fender Palomino guitar he used on that day 50 years ago.Bowie fan Wendy Faulkner, the organiser of the Bowie’s Beckenham Oddity festival, said the singer had been aware of the fundraising to restore the bandstand. “In 2013, on his last trip over to the UK, he took his wife and daughter around certain parts of Bromley and London, to places which were special to him. And he came back to the bandstand,” she said.The listed status was important, she added. “His career started to take shape in Beckenham. And he started to write his song Life on Mars from the very steps of that bandstand.”Other original performers at the Growth festival, who are returning to mark the 50th anniversary this weekend, include singer Bridget St John, David Cousins from the Strawbs, and the US musician Amory Kane.Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “Walking past this typical yet characterful bandstand, you probably wouldn’t expect it was once the stage for a young man who would become one of the most iconic musicians of the 20th century.“It is a rare survival from a historic iron foundry in its own right, but its significance as a site that inspired David Bowie shows us how powerful our historic places can be and how important it is that we protect them so they will continue to inspire people for years to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ded52c15fb246b51983ce1cbea30abe2cf58e8f/0_0_4032_5905/master/4032.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0594defe5282f98b316674a85fbefe14 2020w","title":"dominic cummings blog political values","story":"The architect of Vote Leave shares his thoughts in his sprawling blog full of italics and capitals– but what are his political values?Poor Dominic Cummings. Throughout his career, he has been surrounded by idiots. The “grotesque incompetents” who blocked his agenda at the Department for Education. The “dysfunctional egomaniacs” who undermined his work for Vote Leave. The “conspiracy network” that has been out to get him since he won the EU referendum. The “narcissist-delusional” members of the European Research Group who messed up his beautiful vision of Brexit. And now he is working with Boris Johnson at No 10.New Labour was heralded by intellectuals such as Will Hutton and Anthony Giddens. In their place, Johnson has Cummings. And, as a guide to his thinking, we have Cummings’s blog.He started it five years ago and has used it as a dumping ground for his thoughts. All of his thoughts. Some entries are only a few lines long while others stretch to 10,000 words. The whole thing, including attachments, has a higher word count than Ulysses. Like Ulysses, it is both focused and digressive, obsessive and uncontainable all emphatic italics and BLOCK CAPS and (1) numbered points leading to (2) apocalyptic conclusions.Cummings studied history at Oxford but writes knowingly about subjects from bio-engineering to space exploration. His style oscillates between the academic and the hard-boiled. He suggests “bunging a few million quid” to someone to liven up the civil service claims that “great unconventional hookers and a bit of imagination … get you into pretty much anywhere” and wonders “what is to stop someone sending a drone swarm across the river and bombing parliament during PMQs”.He boasts (rightly) that Vote Leave changed the course of European history, but says his contribution to the referendum result has been overestimated. “I am not clever, I have a hopeless memory, and have almost no proper ‘circle of competence’.” His only strength, he says, comes from his “demented focus”.He thinks the political establishment is full of people who want to be something rather than do something. “The MPs and pundits get up, read each other, tweet at each other, give speeches, send press releases, have dinner, attack, fuck or fight each other, do the same tomorrow and think ‘this is reality’.”Unlike these professional politicians, Cummings had what he calls “proper jobs” between leaving Oxford and joining the anti-euro campaign in 1998. “I’m not claiming I was good at anything,” he says, “but working in nightclubs and starting businesses in Russia counts as ‘the real world’.” According to reports, the nightclub belonged to his uncle Phil and the Russian business was an airline that folded after its first flight left without a single passenger.It is not just his CV that distinguishes him from most politicians. He is not afraid to speak his mind. In fact, he cannot pass a sacred cow without shooting it. He talks of banning political parties. He wants to revolutionise the education system, so that the most gifted students are prepared from the age of 15 for the challenges of leadership. He would then replace our current crop of policymakers with these prodigies, selected on the basis of their IQ rather than their ability to work the party system or the civil service fast track.He is inspired by the teams behind the Apollo space programme and the creation of the internet, who were encouraged to challenge each other, helping to fight groupthink and ensure a ersity of opinions. Cummings does not welcome all forms of challenge, however. When the culture select committee asked him to give evidence about Vote Leave’s use of personal data, he refused to attend unless the MPs swore an oath to tell the truth. He has a point here, of sorts. Unlike a court of law, a select committee is a political arena and, under parliamentary privilege, politicians are legally free to lie. All the same, it isn’t clear why he couldn’t just answer the MPs’ questions and have done with it. They are, for better or worse, elected by the public.More broadly, it is hard to reconcile the two versions of Cummings that emerge from the blog. On the one hand, there is the technocrat who thinks the country should be run by an intellectual elite. On the other, there is the populist who says a second referendum would be “a rematch against the public”. So, what are Cummings’s real political values?“I’ve never been a party person,” he claims. “I’m not Tory, libertarian, ‘populist’ or anything else. I follow projects I think are worthwhile.” But how does he choose which projects are worthwhile? Is he motivated by a belief in order, freedom or equality? He spurns these ideologies. In his view, conservatism, liberalism and socialism are inadequate guides to policy-making, and should be replaced with a more “scientific” approach. This raises big questions. How would his government of non-political geniuses decide between competing priorities? Or reconcile the trade-offs between different interest groups? Or resolve ethical dilemmas about, for example, gene editing or humanity’s use of finite environmental resources? And aren’t his own views – on the EU, human rights and free markets, say – just the tiniest bit political?To his detractors, Cummings is a monster. To his fans, he is a guru. On the evidence of the blog, he is neither. He is an extreme rationalist, who is prepared to share his ideas in the form of this sprawling work-in-progress. He yearns for a world beyond politics – but does not explain how to square this with the fact that people disagree about things, and that these disagreements are based on different worldviews, of which his is only one.Nonetheless, his boldness is invigorating. Political thinkers on both sides may reject his conclusions, but they should engage with his thinking. I hope that he will turn the blog into a book. However, it will be a brave editor who dares to ask him for rewrites.• Jonathan Heawood’s The Press Freedom Myth will be published in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad49224cd5c41453c81c0df2309ff5a22e36167a/0_165_4815_2890/master/4815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2e0da0264a408200acf5cae6815318e","title":"how the neithers could decide northern irelands political fate","story":"Fifty years after the tribalism of the Troubles, the ‘non-aligned’ are likely to determine the outcome of any referendum on unification with the Republic of IrelandWhen the British army was deployed in Northern Ireland 50 years ago, Anthony Kennedy was not out on the streets protesting or lobbing petrol bombs.“The truth, I was trying to get laid,” he recalled this week.It was the start of what became known as as the Troubles. As the months and years ground on, pitting those who sought a united Ireland against those dedicated to keeping Northern Ireland in the UK, Kennedy stayed on the sidelines.In 1969, aged 21, he identified neither as nationalist nor unionist. He was in the middle, a “neither” camped out in no man’s land. It turned out to be crowded with plenty of others. “I never felt isolated. I always felt I was part of a group.”But the bloodier the conflict became, and the more that images of soldiers, shootings and bombings came to define Northern Ireland, the more those in the middle felt invisible and powerless. Tribalism ruled, and they were not a tribe.Soldiers sent in to try to quell rioting in Derry which broke out after nationalists threw stones and bottles at a contentious Protestant Apprentice Boys parade two days earlierBritish army fatally shoots 13 Catholic protesters during a civil rights march in Derry against internmentEdward Heath’s Conservative government closes the unionist-dominated Stormont parliament and imposes direct rule, which is to last for 26 years.IRA expands campaign to mainland Britain, detonating bombs in two pubs in Guildford, killing five people, and continues to target other pubs popular with army personnel across the countryThe Irish National Liberation Army kills the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, who is a close confidant of Margaret Thatcher, with a car bombAfter 66 days on hunger strike, during which he was elected to parliament, the IRA member Bobby Sands dies in detention in the Maze prisonAn IRA bomb explodes at the Grand hotel during the Conservative party conference, killing five people and injuring 30, including the party chairman, Norman Tebbit.After two years of intensive talks, the agreement is signed and is celebrated as the end of the Troubles. It establishes the Northern Ireland assembly, with David Trimble as its first ministerA car bomb planted by the Real IRA, a dissident splinter group, kills 29 people in Omagh, County TyroneThe Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Féin agree to enter a historic power-sharing government, with Ian Paisley as first minister and Martin McGuinness as his deputyThis week’s commemorations have again left them in the shadows. Former combatants and victims with tales of courage, atrocity and suffering have taken centre stage.Yet the “neithers”, also known as the non-aligned, are emerging as a political force that could yet determine the fate of Northern Ireland.“Fifty years ago, the door closed on the non-aligned,” said Kennedy, who is the chair of a society named after the late poet John Hewitt, who famously described his identity as Ulster, Irish, British and European. “It feels the door is gradually opening.”Over the past decade, unionist parties have not won an overall majority of votes, and support for the nationalist parties of Sinn Féin and the SDLP has plateaued.“We’re all minorities now,” said Conor Houston, the founder of Connected Citizens, an initiative to foster dialogue and inclusion. “Non-aligned people are starting to raise their voice.”Last week an audience at Féile an Phobail, a festival in the Sinn Féin bastion of west Belfast, welcomed Long almost as warmly as it did the Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald.The paradox is that the centrist surge is happening amid polarisation that has collapsed power-sharing at Stormont and stirred resentment over unresolved “legacy” killings, many involving British soldiers.The death of Lyra McKee, a 29-year-old journalist and activist shot by the New IRA in April, shone a light on a new generation that, like McKee, cares more about LGBTQ+ rights, healthcare and jobs than whether sovereignty lies in London or Dublin.There is a perception that in 1969 Northern Ireland’s middle class, and by extension many of the non-aligned, went off to play golf in leafy enclaves, leaving the Troubles to unfold mainly in border towns and blighted urban pockets.For his part, Kennedy was hardly apolitical. He wanted – and still wants – Britain’s Labour party to contest elections in Northern Ireland. Bereft of a leftwing option, Kennedy skirted politics and instead contributed by working in housing and reconciliation.“It’s difficult to make a positive identity out of a negative definition,” said Paul Nolan, a leading academic who studies social trends.The 1998 Good Friday agreement drew a line under violence and facilitated more fluid national identities but its focus on “both communities” and “two traditions” entrenched binary politics, according to a 2018 Queen’s University study.However, the number of “neithers” still grew in the intervening 20 years, it found. They tended to have jobs, a good education and to have lived abroad. They were more likely to be women and Catholic.And the numbers would probably keep growing, said Katy Hayward, a co-author of the study. With Brexit and the recent electoral success of the Greens and the Alliance, a centre grouping in favour of devolution and EU membership seemed to be forming, she said. “Those from a unionist a background that are pro-remain are reconsidering themselves as no longer unionist with a capital U.”It is unclear how “neithers” would vote in a unity referendum. It would depend on the impact of Brexit, the handling of cultural issues, such as same-sex marriage and the Irish language, and the details of a proposed united Ireland, said Nicholas Whyte, an analyst.Belfast still resembles a ided city. Flags and murals glorifying paramilitaries mark republican and loyalist territory “peace walls” split contentious neighbourhoods and traditional parades and bonfires are used to taunt the other side.Seemingly mundane developments, such as a bus route connecting east and west, had normalised journeys that cut across sectarian ides, said Fr Martin Magill, a Catholic priest on the Falls Road.Increasingly, foreigners come not to gawk at murals but for jobs in a burgeoning tech industry or for Titanic and Game of Thrones-themed tourism.Northern Ireland’s other cultural export, poetry, has also evolved.Noland said cross-community “planter and gael” collaborations between poets from each side of the political ide had given way to works by Sinead Morrissey, Alan Gillis and Leontia Flynn that reflect mobile, fluid identities.“It is a perspective which allows them to touch glancingly on the Northern Ireland experience without ever being branded by tribal loyalties.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e76b251df216f784b2d13425bc76a1140914b201/1763_143_3524_2114/master/3524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc3928d66028f70ec4a9acc8eb8fd59","title":"lib dems urged to back corbyn as interim pm to stop no deal brexit","story":"Party finds itself isolated after opposition figures – and some Tories – say they would back Labour planThe Liberal Democrats are under growing pressure to back Jeremy Corbyn as a caretaker prime minister to stop a no-deal Brexit after leading opposition figures and even one former Conservative minister said they were open to the idea.With anti-no-deal groups rapidly calibrating their positions in the aftermath of Corbyn’s intervention, a split has opened up among MPs hoping to block Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy. But while the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens said they would engage with Corbyn’s offer, the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, laid out a rival plan for a national unity government led by the Tory veteran Ken Clarke or Labour’s Harriet Harman.After Swinson initially sounded a hostile note towards Corbyn’s plan, saying it was “nonsense”, the Lib Dems were widely urged to reconsider and found themselves isolated among anti-no-deal groups.Labour’s Angela Rayner branded the Lib Dem leader “childish”, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, criticised her position as “daft”, and Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, made a personal appeal for Swinson to rethink her position.The date on which the Commons is likely to return from summer recess. It is the first date that MPs could hold a vote of no confidence in the new prime minister. However, rebel MPs would need to be confident they could form an alternative government, as many wish to avoid triggering an election.Mps would be due to go on conference recess - but could continue to sit if a no-confidence vote had been lost.Assuming the government has lost a confidence vote, this would be the deadline for Labour or any unity government to win a confidence vote. If not achieved, Boris Johnson would call an election. Parliament could then be prorogued.The Labour and Conservative party conferences are due to be held on consecutive weeks.Parliament would be dissolved if an election were to be held on 1 November.\u0026nbspEU leaders meet for the final European council summit before the UK\u0027s extension is due to expire. Rebel Tories and remainers may choose to call a no-confidence vote if an extension is not offered as a way of preventing no deal.The six-month article 50 extension will expire.The UK could hold a general election.Meanwhile Sarah Wollaston, the newest Lib Dem MP, appeared to go further than Swinson by saying backing Corbyn to avoid a no-deal Brexit would be “the lesser of two evils”.Swinson later released a more nuanced letter to the Labour leader agreeing to meet him for talks and not ruling out the possibility of backing him as leader of a caretaker government if it would stop a no-deal Brexit.But she challenged him to find the eight Conservative MPs necessary to make a success of his proposal for a temporary government to delay Brexit and hold a general election.While Corbyn has seized the initiative on Brexit and forced other anti-no-deal factions to respond, he remains well short of the numbers needed to form a caretaker government, with the Lib Dems non-committal and a number of independent MPs and Tory rebels declining to back him under any circumstances.However, some of the Labour leader’s political opponents are leaving the door open to supporting him as a last resort to stop no deal. Wollaston, the former Conservative MP who had been sitting as an independent after leaving the newly formed Change UK in June, told the  that while she viewed a Corbyn government as preferable to no-deal, she also viewed it as unlikely.“Obviously, as the lesser of two evils, I would have to make a judgment and probably say: you know what, I think it would be worse to have no deal,” she said. “But let’s see what happens at that point, and ultimately what I do is beside the point. You need five or six Tories to do it, and I’m sorry but they are just not going to do it.”Liberal Democrats may end up ided on the issue should Swinson ultimately decide to back Corbyn’s bid. The former Labour MP and strident Corbyn critic Chuka Umunna, who joined the Lib Dems this summer, is likely to oppose any option that would put Corbyn in Downing Street.Corbyn’s offer was not dismissed out of hand by some Conservative MPs. Guto Bebb, a former Conservative minister who supports a second referendum, said: “I do think that those who have said that they will do anything necessary to stop the long-term damage of a no-deal exit must take seriously this type of offer.”He added: “So I think that there are other proposals that can be taken in terms of ensuring no deal is taken off the table. But I certainly take the view that a short-term Jeremy Corbyn government is less damaging than the generational damage that would be caused by a no-deal Brexit.”Three Conservatives – Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Caroline Spelman – plus Nick Boles, a former Tory who is now independent, all agreed to meet Corbyn to discuss possible ways to block no deal. Spelman made clear there were no circumstances in which she would vote to make Corbyn prime minister.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, issued a stern rebuke to any Conservative MP thinking of backing the bid for a unity government in order to stop no deal, suggesting they were risking the country’s security and economic stability.“I think it’s absolutely extraordinary that any Conservative MP considered even for one minute installing Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street,” he said. “I just think that any Conservative should think very, very hard about doing this.”Among the most positive towards Corbyn’s plan were Lucas and Sturgeon. The latter told an event at the Edinburgh fringe that she had argued for a progressive alternative to a Tory government at the last two elections, and “I would want us to be part of that”.She said offering SNP support “doesn’t make me a great fan of Jeremy Corbyn … but I would always try to work to put together an alternative to a Tory government.”Lucas was also supportive but went on to challenge Corbyn to say he would support an alternative leader if his plan failed.Liz Saville-Roberts, Plaid Cymru’s Westminster leader, said her party was open to backing a unity government and it did not matter who led it, but a second referendum should be the priority. “If necessary Mr Corbyn should step aside to ensure a referendum is delivered,” she said.Setting out her own plan, Swinson said her preferred option was legislation to request an extension of article 50 in order to hold a second referendum, with remain an option.Her next choice would be a no-confidence vote against Johnson, before “installing an emergency government with an alternative prime minister who has the confidence of the house and will stop a no-deal Brexit”.She later released her letter to Corbyn saying she “stands ready to work with anyone to stop Boris Johnson and his hardline Brexit government pursuing no deal”, and agreeing to discussions on a “deliverable” plan.But she said “regardless of how my party were to vote” he would still need at least eight Conservatives MPs to support his bid to take office, because a string of independents were unlikely to back him.Anna Soubry, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, said none of her MPs would back Corbyn, while the independents Heidi Allen, Ian Austin and Chris Leslie all dismissed the idea.

The interim period between the Challenge Cup semi-finals and the Wembley showpiece is often a breeding ground for a drop-off in form but this wonderful team are simply too good to be bothered by any of that kind of nonsense right now.The league table can frequently be misleading but, when it comes to Justin Holbrook’s team of all talents, it tells you everything. The size of the task awaiting Warrington next week at Wembley when they face the Saints is underlined by the fact that everyone – even the second-placed Wolves – are now closer to the bottom of the table than they are to the runaway Super League leaders.Their remarkable 16-point lead is now almost certainly set to be the greatest in Super League history too – with Castleford’s 10-point margin at the top two years ago the benchmark.This was far from a serene warm-up for St Helens. The Saints, facing a Leeds side who have scored 92 points in back-to-back victories to ease their relegation fears, came across the Pennines without seven first-teamers who should all return for Wembley.With half-time approaching, they were in a real battle, trailing 10-6 on merit – but thereafter it was a familiar story for anyone who has had the privilege of seeing this side first-hand in 2019. Thirty unanswered points, five brilliant tries and a dominant second-half display later, the Rhinos had been comprehensively dispatched, albeit despite a late comeback from them to add a semblance of respectability to the scoreline.Leeds afforded the Super League leaders a guard of honour pre-match after recently securing a second successive League Leader’s Shield. However, there was very little in the way of sentiment from the hosts when the game got underway. The Rhinos were much the stronger side in the opening quarter – but they were unable to convert any of their sustained pressure.And having turned possession over in prime attacking opportunities on numerous occasions, the Saints made them pay. Following a half-break from Mark Percival, the league leaders kept the ball alive long enough for Jack Welsby to turn the ball on for Regan Grace, the Welsh wing finishing in the corner to break the deadlock.That, however, seemed to rid Leeds of their attacking profligacy. Eight minutes after falling behind, they were level when a wonderful solo effort from their scrum-half, Richie Myler, made it 6-6. Then, with five minutes until the break, the hosts went ahead when Konrad Hurrell’s fine offload sent Ash Handley over in the corner for his 20th try of the season.Rhyse Martin missed the conversion, but just as it looked as though the Rhinos would take a four-point lead into half-time, the Saints hit back with the try of the half. Despite their absent first-teamers, the fluidity in the build-up play which led to Kevin Naiqama’s try that levelled the scores was sensational, with the Fijian finishing in the corner to make it 10-10.How crucial that try proved to be, too. The Saints went almost immediately on the attack after half-time, and by the time Leeds had restored any sort of order, the visitors were out of sight. An error from Luke Briscoe allowed Zeb Taia to touch down a Theo Fages kick, before the second-row claimed his second soon after following marvellous work from Grace.Then on the hour mark, back-to-back tries came from Naiqama to complete his hat-trick and put the result beyond doubt. A Percival penalty made it 24-10, before Naiqama raced on to two excellent passes from the teenage full-back, Jack Welsby in the space of four minutes. Percival converted both, and even the most ardent Leeds supporters inside Headingley will have been appreciative of what they were witnessing by this stage.To the Rhinos’ credit – who are still almost certainly too good to go down on the evidence of recent displays – they finished with two well-worked tries of their own. Handley claimed his 21st try of the season, before Briscoe’s ball back inside sent Harry Newman over in the closing seconds. By then though, the result had long since been decided."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ec829aa76305193e7bf028770da69776ebb17a/0_132_1497_898/master/1497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a302d5a4fb7b7d0b22422c39e218686","title":"rory burns counts his blessings amid england fragility at lords","story":"Australia players taunt the England left-hander that he is just lucky but he simply knows how to exploit every opportunityThe way Gary Player tells it, it goes like this. He was practising his bunker game somewhere in Texas when “this good old boy with a big hat stopped to watch”. Player hit his next shot into the hole and the stranger said to him, “You got 50 bucks if you get the next one in.” Player did, so the Texan said he double it if he made three in a row. “Boy,” he told Player as he peeled a hundred off his roll of bills a second later. “I’ve never seen anyone so lucky in my life.”So Player fired back at him, “It’s funny, the harder I practise, the luckier I get.” And that, Player says, “is where the quote originated”.Rory Burns, eight Tests into his career, has already won himself a reputation as a lucky player, as the Australia players keep telling him. At Edgbaston Tim Paine chose not to review a plumb lbw when Burns was on 21 and he went on to make a century. At Lord’s he was dropped twice off Peter Siddle’s bowling and went on to make 50.There was one chance on 16, when he steered a short ball straight to Usman Khawaja at gully, and another on 47, when he sliced a fat edge through low to Paine’s left. The point is, as Player says, that luck does not much matter unless you are good enough to do something with it and Burns has, now, in two of his last three innings.Burns finished up with 53, top score in another underwhelming England innings, and he faced 127 balls, which was almost as many as the rest of England’s top six managed between them. It was not a perfect innings or a pretty one but a gritty one, and that was just what England needed from him in the circumstance.Even Burns’s nearest and dearest surely would not say he was a handsome batsman. His stance makes him look as if he spent the previous night sleeping in the front seat of a car. But it works for him, and he weathered two superb spells, one from Josh Hazlewood at the Nursery End and another from Pat Cummins coming in from the Pavilion.Hazlewood opened with six pitilessly accurate overs, five runs, three maidens, two wickets. Cummins followed up, after lunch, with a brutal spell of short, nasty fast bowling. Burns blocked and prodded his way through one, shuffled and swayed his way through the other, although Cummins pinned him twice, once on the chest, then again on the arm. In between Burns picked off the odd loose deliveries Siddle served him and played a couple of self-assured sweeps away for four through midwicket off Nathan Lyon.In many ways it was modest stuff. There were no swaggering pulls or swingeing drives, just nudges, nurdles and clumps but it gave some badly needed ballast to this England team, whose batting sometimes seems so flighty, so frail, that it might be blown over by the lightest gust of fast bowling.There is an old story about the time Keith Miller led 12 men on to the field when he was captaining New South Wales. “One of you fuck off,” Miller is supposed to have said when he realised his mistake, “and the rest of you scatter.” It sometimes feels as if this England team put a similar amount of planning into their batting strategy.They seems to work on the principle that, if they just pack enough talented stroke-makers into the team, one of them is bound to do the trick. It is the superhero theory of Test match batting. They are always waiting for someone to come to the rescue. That attitude works for them in the one-day game, where they are always willing to spend wickets for runs, but it is no way to play Test cricket, because it usually ends up with everyone at sixes and sevens. Which fits, because sixes and sevens is exactly what they are. They have at least four players in this team who would all be best off batting in one of those two positions. Five, if you include Jason Roy, who bats lower down in the county championship for Surrey.Surrey’s director of cricket, Alec Stewart, keeps saying Roy ought be in the Test team too, but there is not much room left down there. In Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Chris Woakes, England have four fine lower middle-order batsmen already. Buttler, who came in at five, is trying his best to do an impression of a man who knows how to play defensively but it is not too convincing. His average goes up by eight runs when he moves down from No 5 to No 6. So does Stokes’, while Bairstow’s increases by 12.Burns, then, is a tortoise among hares. In the end it took an astonishing bit of fielding to dismiss him. Cummins banged in another short ball and Burns pushed it away to short-leg, where the ball actually bounced off Cameron Bancroft’s palm as he lunged down for it. He managed to reach out his hand and catch the rebound as he fell to the ground. It was a miraculous catch. It might even have been called an unlucky way to get out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb15015baea1d3fcf70d5bf8a8e88c8794675e0d/0_0_5414_3249/master/5414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da21c8a3790f4935b230cfb7a68fb473","title":"rose mcgowan metoo planet 9 review edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Assembly Hall, EdinburghThe #MeToo activist made herself a refuge, where orbs shimmer and we can be our best selves. What a pity she spends this frustrating show wafting around like a refugee from 1970s sci-fiYou can understand why Rose McGowan might want to leave this planet behind her. She grew up in and then fled a cult, fell into the arms of another cult (as she describes Hollywood), survived sexual assault and endured the abuse that came with leading the #MeToo campaign against it. Small wonder she created a place to take refuge: Planet 9, where orbs shimmer and we’re all free to become our best and most beautiful selves. But on the basis of her new show, one doubts whether many will come along for the ride.The show and album that take us there were created alongside her memoir, Brave. The latter gave vent to her anger the former is more optimistic. “We don’t have to be so earthbound in our thinking,” McGowan tells us, barefoot and stately in a white Grecian robe. This “visuals, spoken word and singing” show features tracks from her album with video she has made herself, spliced into a sermon about escaping our psychological shackles and realising our potential to be free. “Not to sound like a Californian hippy”, she says at one point. That is exactly how she sounds.Which isn’t a problem in itself: Californian hippies have plenty to teach us. But McGowan seldom escapes their most cliched expressions. “Take my hand  Sail in air  On solar flares,” she speak-sings to ambient electronica, while blissed-out visuals pulse and swirl onscreen. Her voice is strong but wayward: she can hold a note, but it doesn’t always sound like the right one.It’s frustrating, because I’d guess the real McGowan, the one she relaxes into when she’s not being her best, astral self, is more entertaining company. We get fleeting glimpses: the odd sardonic laugh or frank aside. More often – wafting around like a refugee from 1970s sci-fi – she’s stilted: words blandly intoned, hands curiously rigid like the astral winds changed direction while she was doing yoga.This is clearly a meaningful project for her, one that has helped her survive, she says, the last three traumatic years. Good luck to her. But audiences might prefer more earthly pleasures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c35677a6984c41a51b9cd6aa8ce3d54a515469/54_40_910_546/master/910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc6d8a74c80e1f684901abc814340098","title":"styx review rocknroll and memory loss","story":"Zoo Southside, EdinburghUsing music, Greek myth and family history to explore dementia, this rousing gigshow is intimate and epic This storytelling concert is a tribute to the power of music, both for its ability to create new memories and to restore old ones. Writer Max Barton and his sister Addison Axe weave together music, myth and family history, tells us about their 87-year-old grandma Flora, who has Alzheimer’s. Accompanied by five Australian alt-rock musicians, Styx is a moving, creative exploration of memory loss.Beautifully staged, the band are gathered like the gods. Their stands are dotted with flickering synapses of light and their rousing, soulful music, at once full of life and mourning. Both song and story are blended with the myth of Orpheus, the god of music, and in tracing the history of Barton and Axe’s grandparents, coincidental parallels tie myth to reality.The structure gets a little lost along the way. Reverb makes some of the lyrics hard to hear, a third mystical storyline is distracting, and a dip into neuroscience is too easily drawn from Wikipedia to match the beauty of the details in the family’s history. It’s their particular story that makes this piece so engaging, and at times it feels as though the current tugs too far away from Flora. But at its best, it soars. A particularly heartbreaking moment comes as Flora talks about her dead husband, who also had the disease, and wishes for the ability to forget her own dementia.Styx evokes a half-remembered song suddenly falling into a melody, with the people you love buried between the notes. Both intimate and epic, the show may be patchy in places, but so too are most of our memories. It left me full of love and desperate to call my grandma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78f22732bd9623968e2dd1d483d51061f9b7b80c/0_558_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bea92b93ef1259e34542f755647e159","title":"ico opens investigation into use of facial recognition in kings cross","story":"Privacy watchdog is seeking details of how technology is used at central London siteThe UK’s privacy watchdog has opened an investigation into the use of facial recognition cameras in a busy part of central London.The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, announced she would look into the technology being used in Granary Square, close to King’s Cross station. Two days ago the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, wrote to the development’s owner demanding to know whether the company believed its use of facial recognition software in its CCTV systems was legal.The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said it was “deeply concerned about the growing use of facial recognition technology in public spaces” and was seeking detailed information about how it is used.“Scanning people’s faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives in order to identify them is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all,” Denham said. “That is especially the case if it is done without people’s knowledge or understanding.“My office and the judiciary are both independently considering the legal issues and whether the current framework has kept pace with emerging technologies and people’s expectations about how their most sensitive personal data is used.“We have launched an investigation following concerns reported in the media regarding the use of live facial recognition in the King’s Cross area of central London, which thousands of people pass through every day.”She added: “As well as requiring detailed information from the relevant organisations about how the technology is used, we will also inspect the system and its operation onsite to assess whether or not it complies with data protection law.”On Monday the development’s owners confirmed facial recognition software was being used around the 67-acre, 50-building site. The consortium of Argent, a property developer, Hermes Investment Management, on behalf of BT Pensioners, and AustralianSuper, an Australian pension scheme, said they were doing so “in the interest of public safety and to ensure that everyone who visits has the best possible experience”.Liberty, the human rights campaign group, has criticised the use of the technology as a “disturbing expansion of mass surveillance that threatens our privacy and freedom of expression as we go about our everyday lives”.The ICO had previously warned businesses using the surveillance technology that they needed to demonstrate that its use is “strictly necessary and proportionate” and has a clear basis in law.Last month the House of Commons science and technology committee suggested authorities cease trials of such technology until a legal framework was established.In a report on the government’s approach to biometrics and forensics, the MPs referred to automatic facial recognition testing carried out by the politan police and South Wales police.They noted that an evaluation of both trials by the Biometrics and Forensics Ethics Group raised questions about accuracy and bias. Concerns were also raised that police custody images of iniduals not convicted of any crime were not being deleted.

What are her best options?I’m due to start my teacher training in September. Which laptop should I buy on a £500 budget? RuqayyahThis question comes up every year. Obviously, the answers change as technology moves on. What doesn’t change much, if at all, is the general advice. You can get most of it from last year’s answer, though a brief summary might be useful.Second, if you’re not doing any computer-intensive work such as video editing, almost any laptop with at least 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage will do the job. All the major brands have suitable laptops including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo. You could also consider a refurbished business laptop from Tier1Online, Morgan or similar source. If you take this route, I strongly recommend a ThinkPad from the X or T ranges with an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of memory and an SSD.Third, think about peripherals. You’ll need an external hard drive for backups, though you should also store important files online. For ergonomic reasons, I recommend a laptop riser (or using a pile of books to lift the screen) and an external ergonomic keyboard for home use. It adds up.Fourth, think about support. If you order a laptop online from Dell, HP or Lenovo, you may be able to buy three years of on-site support for a reasonable price. In Lenovo’s case, it can be as little as £61.56. Tier1Online also guarantees machines for three years for a small extra fee, but doesn’t provide on-site support.Do you want a laptop for use at home or in your digsflatetc, or one that you can take to lectures and use around campus? There is scientific evidence that students who make notes on paper learn more.Traditionally, students have bought 15.6in laptops as desktop replacements. These machines are fast and cheap, but they are heavy to carry around, and tend to have short battery lives.Laptops with 14in screens are a good compromise. New ones have thin bezels so they are no bigger than old 13.3in laptops, and they generally have Full HD (1920 x 1080) instead of HD (1366 x 768) screens. Most are small and light enough to carry around at least part of the time.You can compare 14in and 15.6in laptops at any good computer store or a department store such as John Lewis.I think a 14in laptop is a good choice for most university and college students, but it may not be the best choice for you.These machines are quite sleek, relatively light (from 1.87kg), and good value for money. The screens are not great, and battery life can be quite poor, but they are within your budget and should cruise through anything you are likely to throw at them.The Pavilion range has improved since HP spun off its PC and printer isions into a separate company, HP Inc, in 2015. Last year, it sold almost as many PCs as Lenovo (56m v 58m) thanks partly to the latest Pavilion laptops, launched in April last year. They have a more premium look and feel, and their metal keyboard decks are distinguished by a geometric grid pattern (speaker grilles) between the keys and the screen.Laptops that sell in large volumes, like the HP Pavilion 14 and Lenovo’s IdeaPad 330S, are available in lots of slightly different versions. This can be confusing, but if you focus on the specifications you care about, you can get the best balance between processor speed, storage and price. I’m linking to Currys PC World for convenience, but you can shop around.The best Pavilions for just under £500 are the 14-ce2500sa (Core i3-8145U, 8GB, 512GB SSD) and the 14-ce1510sa (Core i5-8265U, 8GB, 128GB). Personally, I’d go for the extra speed of the Core i5, unless you have a particular need for the extra storage space.You could save £50 by going for the 14-ce1507sa (Core i3-8145U, 8GB, 250GB SSD) for £449. This is slower but should comfortably do what you need. However, you will get worse performance if you drop down to the 14-ce0593sa (Pentium Gold 4415U, 4GB, 128GB SSD) at £379, and you can’t upgrade the processor later.Typically with these machines, you can remove the single memory module and replace it with a 16GB module. You can also upgrade the M2 SSD, or install a 2.5in SSD. However, if you plan to do either, check the specific model beforehand to make sure it can be upgraded.Think of it as £3.50 per week over three years and it won’t sound so bad. It’s not a lot compared with the cost of fees, travel and general living expenses.Have you got a question?

We took a canoe out to the sea to get closer to migrating humpback whales, and noticed a mother and calf in the distance breaching from the water. After a few minutes they disappeared, leaving the three of us scanning the horizon for signs of movement. Suddenly, a few feet from our canoe, the huge eye of the mother appeared, deep, black, and staring straight at us. She was giving us the once-over and, deciding we were not a threat, she rolled over to reveal her calf, nestled against her belly. We sat for a while, gazing, and then they ed, turning into hazy smudges as they disappeared.WilliamEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Having been notified on his Orkney cetacean alert app, he was glued to his telescope, viewing a pod of six orcas in Stromness harbour. “Looks like they are moving towards the coast, get in the car!” Slinging on our warmest waterproofs, we raced down to the Point of Ness via the campsite and arrived as the pod rounded the headland. The two adults guided their four young on their breakfast fishing spree along the coast at Guardhouse Park. As they headed off up the coast out of sight, we headed back for our own breakfasts, elated.Beverley CattermoleA couple of years ago I was in Cape Town for a wedding. The city is one of the best places in the world for spotting great white sharks, and we hopped on a conservation boat with some PhD students studying great whites’ behaviour in Hout Bay. The boat took us to Seal Island, about 20 minutes out. Around 30,000 seals were crammed on to what was essentially a very large rock. Deafened by the noise of the seals, we watched as great whites started circling the island, picking off young seals one by one. The sheer power of the sharks was intense. To top the trip off, we were followed by a pod of around 20 dolphins on the way back to shore and spotted a Bryde’s whale descending. Incredible experience.NeilIn Barbados it is not uncommon to see hawksbill, green and leatherback sea turtles, but you are normally surrounded by dozens of other tourists, especially if you are on any kind of organised trip. For an altogether more relaxing swim with the likelihood of encountering these magnificent creatures, I often head to Carlisle Bay early in the morning. At that time of the day everyone is at the far ends of the beach and the tourist boats are nowhere to be seen. We have spent many a peaceful hour snorkelling around the shipwreck and coral, almost always in the company of a handful of sea turtles and huge shoals of reef fish. Kirsty YeomansIs there anything more captivating than a rock pool? Discovering these miniature ecosystems on a holiday in Corralejo, Fuerteventura, took me straight back to my childhood. Aged five, crouching on a Cornish beach, prodding anemones and scooping more sand than sea life into a bucket, life couldn’t have been more glorious. Now older, I’ve recaptured that pleasure, spotting tiny hermit crabs, suckerfish and curious little beautifully coloured blennies. Transparent shrimp tickled my feet as they investigated me, and crabs emerged from their rocky shelters to graze on algae. I could have spent hours watching all these fascinating little creatures.RobynThere was a hissing sound like an angry cat and I looked up to see my first British otter in the wild – the culmination of many years of unsuccessful otter walks from the River Otter in Devon to the Isle of Mull. Otters are claimed on many rivers and much of our coastline but they have been avoiding me for years! My wife caught up with me just as the otter disappeared into Broadford Bay. We headed back down the coast savouring the late afternoon light and suddenly the otter re-emerged from the sea and climbed out on to a rock with a newly caught crab. It was too engrossed to notice us this time, and we enjoyed a superb and extended view of this beautiful and elusive creature.Pete DavisA 50-minute boat ride from Fionnphort, Mull, off the west coast of Scotland, is the Isle of Staffa. Landing on the island, you walk up a steep set of stairs and along a ridge before stopping at the cliff edge to watch puffins e for fish. The puffins seemed unafraid of people: when we sat down to recover from the walk a puffin landed next to us to watch for fish. Its bright beak against a grey north Atlantic sky was beautiful, and watching the playful nature of the puffins’ es was so absorbing we nearly missed the boat home. The three-hour trip costs £35pp with Staffa Tours from Mull or Iona.JenniferIf your best whale sighting has been a glimpse from a crowded whale-watching boat, you need to go kayaking at Moss Landing in Monterey Bay. Dave, our guide, told us we’d see half a dozen whales, plus some seals and otters. That was an understatement. We quickly lost count of the whales, and couldn’t even begin to count the otters. Not only that, but seeing them at eye level, without a boat rail separating you, really brings home their true scale and majesty. Dave warned us it might not be the safest thing we would ever do, but it was undoubtedly one of the best. • Humpback whalessea otters tour $75, April-October, santacruzkayakSamLooking for a holiday with a difference?

God help us allIn the foothills of the Himalayas, the heavens open and toxic rain drills the earth of Jim Corbett national park. Bear Grylls is pacing like a … No! Stop! Resist the Grylls compulsion to reverse anthropomorphise. Like a … posh white ex-SAS soldier-turned-“survivalist” exaggerating jeopardy for the sake of his TV series (on Discovery Channel). Better. He has got “pre-match nerves”. This is what happens when “two men and a bunch of Secret Service meet in the jungle surrounded by tigers”. And the other man squaring up to the wild happens to be the prime minister of India.Hours later, the motorcade appears carrying the far-right nationalist leader once widely rebuked as a Hindu supremacist, but now a perfectly palatable subject for the Grylls treatment. Come on, Grylls took Barack Obama to Alaska. In the reign of false equivalence, why not Narendra Modi?Grylls gestures them along the track, a lone white man directing traffic in an otherwise unpeopled Indian landscape. Actually, the way he ushers the prime minister into his own national park is reminiscent of our testosterone-fuelled PM doing his utmost to shepherd Scotland’s first minister through her own front door last month. Oh, deluded machismo. No matter the environment, there is no camouflaging your condescending stripes.“India is a country full of ersity,” the prime minister announces, when he can get a word in between Grylls whitesplaining India to him. “A hundred languages, 1,600 dialects ...” Never mind that this is from a leader implicated in the 2002 Gujarat massacre, in which more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, were killed, mutilated and raped. This is Modi the sage and nature lover who reminds us, as Grylls hands him a spear fashioned out of bark and virility, that his beliefs don’t allow him to kill.It is hard to think of a more monstrous exemplar of our times than this Putin-style propaganda exercise, both praised and ridiculed when it aired in India earlier this week, masquerading as, well, what exactly? Entertainment? News? One wants to say what next, but the truth is this is it. We have arrived at the inconceivable and it looks like Grylls and Modi were sniffing elephant dung in the north Indian wilderness while, reportedly, a terror attack played out in Kashmir. The programme went out days after Modi imposed direct rule over the disputed region. His government now stands accused of acting without legal authority by revoking Kashmir’s special status. So even though one has used up all the synonyms for “unconscionable” in the thesaurus, when the unspeakable keeps on coming, so too must the words.The strongmen set off on an adventure that, unfortunately, none of us will forget, crossing five miles of grassland teeming with tigers, “the absolute ninjas of concealment”, as Grylls calls them. Not one is seen. Perhaps the ninjas of concealment are repelled by the swarm of camera crew, Secret Service, and the sight of two chest-beating men failing to listen to each other. Anyway, that doesn’t stop Grylls from banging on about how dangerous the enterprise is. “You are the most important man in India,” he gushes. “My job is to keep you alive, sir.”They sail across a freezing river on a makeshift raft, plunging deeper into the mythical land of Modi’s self-image. We hear about his impoverished childhood his teens spent learning from yogis in the Himalayas and the 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat, during which the massacre took place, before “my country decided I needed to do this job”. We hear how this perilous hike, in which the only real danger lies in the loss of one’s moral compass, is Modi’s first holiday in 18 years, and how he has never felt fear, which is truly terrifying. “In my mind it never occurs to me who I am,” he says. “I am above all this.” To which Grylls can only sigh: “You’re an inspiration.”They talk about climate change, less the problem of governments and more about our lifestyles because: “We exploit nature for our own enjoyment.” Over neem tea, they decide that it is up to the people of India to sort it out. Finally, it is time for the leader of the largest democracy in the world to return to his chopper. “Before we go, could you allow me the privilege to say a little prayer for you,” Grylls asks. And he gives thanks, “for this great man and this great country”. He attempts a joke about the prime minister’s underpants.

The move came just hours after Trump publicly urged Israel not to allow the two Democratic lawmakers into the country in a highly unusual effort to influence a foreign government against his political opponents.Omar responded to Israel’s announcement by stating it was “an affront” for the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to acquiesce to pressure from Trump.“Trump’s Muslim ban is what Israel is implementing, this time against two duly elected Members of Congress,” she said in a statement. “Denying entry into Israel not only limits our ability to learn from Israelis, but also the Palestinian territories.”She added: “Sadly, this is not a surprise given the public positions of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has consistently resisted peace efforts, restricted the freedom of movement of Palestinians, limited public knowledge of the brutal realities of the occupation and aligned himself with Islamophobes like Donald Trump.”Later Tlaib responded to Israel’s decision to block her trip there, saying it showed “weakness”. Top Democrats in Washington swiftly condemned Israel’s actions while urging its government to change course.“Denying entry to members of the United States Congress is a sign of weakness, not strength,” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, a staunch supporter of Israel, said in a statement. “It will only hurt the US-Israeli relationship and support for Israel in America.”“No democratic society should fear an open debate,” he added. “Many strong supporters of Israel will be deeply disappointed in this decision, which the Israeli government should reverse.”The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she was “deeply saddened” by the news.“Israel’s denial of entry to Congresswomen Tlaib and Omar is a sign of weakness, and beneath the dignity of the great State of Israel,” Pelosi said in a statement. “I pray that the government of Israel will reverse that denial.”She also criticized Trump’s interference in the process, stating: “The president’s statements about the congresswomen are a sign of ignorance and disrespect, and beneath the dignity of the office of the president.”Several 2020 Democratic presidential contenders also lambasted the decision to deny entry to Omar and Tlaib, which the Israeli government largely attributed to the two freshmen lawmakers’ support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian rights.“Banning Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel and Palestine is a sign of enormous disrespect to these elected leaders, to the United States Congress, and to the principles of democracy,” the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders tweeted.He added: “It is disgusting that a bigot like Trump is attacking @RashidaTlaib and @IlhanMN in this way. Opposing Netanyahu’s policies is not ‘hating the Jewish people.’ We must stand together against those who promote hatred and racism in Israel, Palestine, the US and everywhere.”The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren decried the move as “shameful” and “unprecedented”.Former vice president Joe Biden tweeted: “No democracy should deny entry to visitors based on the content of their ideas—even ideas they strongly object to.”Netanyahu defended his government’s rationale, claiming the sole purpose of Tlaib’s and Omar’s visit was “to damage Israel and to foment against Israel”.“There is no country in the world that respects the US and the American Congress more than Israel,” the prime minister said in a statement.Netanyahu added that his government would consider allowing Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, to visit family members in the occupied West Bank if she submitted a request on humanitarian grounds.But even the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, arguably the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington, criticized the decision.“We disagree with Reps Omar and Tlaib’s support for the anti-Israel and anti-peace BDS movement, along with Rep Tlaib’s calls for a one-state solution,” the group wrote on its Twitter account. “We also believe every member of Congress should be able to visit and experience our democratic ally Israel firsthand.”J Street, a lobbying group that has positioned itself as a more liberal voice for the Washington-based Jewish community, said Israel’s move was “dangerous, unacceptable and wrong”.“We may disagree with the views that the members hold on such questions as BDS or with Rep Tlaib on the two-state solution, but the right approach for a state that values democracy is to welcome criticism and debate, not to shut it down,” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, J Street’s president, in a statement.“The fact that President Trump has already tweeted out his own call for these representatives to be denied entry illustrates that this decision is motivated purely by politics and ideology – not by the interests of the State of Israel,” he added.“It is an affront to Congress and the American people and does severe damage to the US-Israel relationship – and it must be reversed immediately.”Just last month Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the US, said the two congresswomen would be permitted to visit Israel “out of respect for the US Congress and the great alliance between Israel and America”. Reports surfaced last week that Trump was encouraging Netanyahu to deny entry to Omar and Tlaib, privately telling advisers that if the two Democrats were in favor of boycotting Israel “then Israel should boycott them”.Trump ratcheted up the pressure in a tweet Thursday morning, stating: “It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep Omar and Rep Tlaib to visit.”“They hate Israel \u0026amp all Jewish people, \u0026amp there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds,” the president wrote.After Israel made its decision public, Trump went after the congresswomen once again, tweeting: “Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!”Trump has made a series of incendiary attacks on Omar and Tlaib, both of whom are outspoken critics of his administration and of the Israeli government.Last month, the president invited an avalanche of criticism for suggesting that Omar, Tlaib and two other congresswomen of color – the representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley – should “go back” to where they “came from”. The four progressive lawmakers, commonly known on Capitol Hill as the Squad, are all US citizens.Although Trump’s tweets were widely denounced as racist, the president refused to back down and went onto single out the quartet at a campaign rally. Trump’s mention of Omar, who came to the US at a young age as a Somali refugee, drew highly controversial chants of “send her back” from his supporters.Tlaib and Omar were poised to visit Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Hebron and had planned to meet with both Israeli and Palestinian peace activists and human rights organizations. They did not have any scheduled events with Israeli officials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f30cbeb6294b1d20183f60651b9c65934e7398/0_69_2184_1309/master/2184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b3f5b415d2e3adccff6e4867a00f8a","title":"jeffrey epstein investigation co conspirators","story":"The financier is dead but the investigation has continued – and it’s possible any participants may have fled into hidingJeffrey Epstein is dead but the investigation that snared on sex trafficking charges has continued as authorities seek to make good on their promise not to let the convicted sex offender’s apparent suicide mark an end to their quest for justice.Given the nature of the wealthy financier’s elite international social scene, it’s possible potential co-conspirators or other participants in the alleged trafficking would have the means to flee into hiding, in the US or abroad.Investigators on any potential manhunt would have at their disposal a range of tools, from facial recognition software and sophisticated techniques to track their finances.But the international character of some of Epstein’s accused enablers begs the question: how would authorities find potential co-conspirators in hiding? If they fled the US or live abroad, how would authorities catch them?So far no one else has been charged in relation to Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse of minors as young as 14 at his Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, homes. But the names of other possible co-conspirators have repeatedly surfaced in court documents and media reports. The highest profile is Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite long accused of procuring girls for Epstein – an allegation she has emphatically denied.Former federal law enforcement agents said that catching any wanted persons relies on traditional police work, the use of technology and close relationships with law enforcement agencies in other countries – not thriller movie-style tactics such as throwing a fugitive in the trunk of a car.The US Marshals Service is the main federal agency tasked with tracking and extraditing persons facing charges in the US who have fled abroad.US law enforcement does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries, so the first step – finding these wanted persons – takes place stateside and in some field offices, according to the Marshals Service.To track a wanted person, “one of the things you always do is follow the money”, said Clinton R Van Zandt, a former FBI criminal profiler and current corporate security expert. “An inidual has to have money to function overseas. That money has to be in a bank account. It has to be wired from point A to point B.”The financial instruments and personal documents people need to function – such as credit cards and passports – can tip off authorities. Facial recognition software allows authorities to take “the image of the face of the fugitive and run that against tens of thousands of iniduals”, Van Zandt said.“You and I can’t walk anywhere in this world without leaving some type of digital footprint or fingerprint – it’s just almost impossible to do,” Van Zandt said. “It’s fairly hard today to just drop out totally unless you’re willing to go to some third-world country and live far below your economic means, change your appearance and never get stopped and never get arrested.”Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former FBI profiler who played an integral role in tracking down the Unabomber, said wanted persons are in a no-win situation when it comes to interacting with others.“Law enforcement will be looking at people who are likely to be able to help this person, who might stick their neck out to help this person,” said O’Toole, who heads the forensic science department at George Mason University in Virginia.Epstein’s elite former associates might find their wealth and status now becomes a disadvantage. Other rich and famous people might well see this person as a liability – potentially making them more likely to tip off authorities.“If you run in a circle of very high-profile people, that means these people are well-known,” she said. “That means these people have a lot to lose to associate with you.”Joseph King, formerly a supervisory special agent with US customs in New York and former chief, national security section for the Department of Homeland Security in New York, said authorities can also use a “trap and chase” to locate a wanted person based on communications with past associates.“Let’s say I’m a fugitive, but they know that I speak to you,” he explained, “so they track all of your phone calls, and try and trace you back to their location.”If US authorities did locate someone abroad, they would inform foreign authorities. If US law enforcement had a good relationship with authorities in that country – and if there weren’t legal issues surrounding extradition – authorities abroad would generally help arrest those wanted persons.In some cases, US marshals are present for the arrest, the agency said.While Interpol does not investigate wanted persons whereabouts, it works “to support police with any international aspects of their investigations”, the agency said in an emailed statement.While US law enforcement doesn’t have jurisdiction abroad, authorities sometimes use informants and subterfuge to track and catch wanted persons on foreign soil.“I place a high value on informants, not just on luring people but on information on their whereabouts,” said King, who is an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.If a person can’t be extradited for some reason, an informant could be used to bring that person into US jurisdiction.“We couldn’t get this Iranian out of England, so my informant said to him: ‘Let’s set up a business deal.’ He said they were going to incorporate this company in Bermuda,” King recalled of one case. “Instead of going to Bermuda, the flight he was on was London-New York-Bermuda.”When the flight stopped in New York, “we just took him off the plane and arrested him”, King said.Private bounty hunters, however, are not controlled by US federal laws on extradition.While private bounty hunting is against the law in some foreign countries, US judges might not have a problem with a fugitive being apprehended in that manner.At times, bringing a wanted person back to the US could be a matter of negotiation.Jennifer Louis-Jeune, a criminal defense lawyer in New York City, said a wanted person out of the country may have a lawyer appointed to guide the process. A person might also broker an inidualized deal to return to the US.“Those may involve deals such as the United States agreeing that they won’t pursue the death penalty if the person’s extradited,” Louis-Jeune said.But no matter the difficulties that may arise, the investigation will probably not stop. It has the public support of America’s top law enforcement official.“Let me assure you that case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,” said the US attorney general, William Barr. “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c34a934de93e5cd86fb9687ca656f74576d13e/345_486_4784_2871/master/4784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5e1e21ed1d84dacd6b591c5097f3354","title":"narendra modi defends indias decision to end kashmir special status","story":"Drones and helicopters fly above heavily fortified cricket stadium as Indian flag unfurledA ceremony in Kashmir to mark India’s independence day had been held under strict security inside a heavily fortified cricket stadium while residents remained under curfew.Drones and helicopters flew overhead as Satya Pal Malik, the Jammu and Kashmir governor, unfurled an Indian flag on Thursday. The ceremony is usually watched by Kashmiri politicians, but many are reportedly under house arrest.Hundreds of people are believed to have been arrested since the Indian government revoked Kashmir’s special status last week.Hasina, the mother of Irfan Amin Malik, a 26-year-old journalist, confirmed he had been detained. The Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal was also arrested in Delhi on Wednesday. Faesal had said before being detained that Kashmir faced an existential battle.Curfew rules affecting millions of residents were strengthened on Thursday for fear of protests, which are common in Kashmir on India’s independence day. The internet and phone lines were blocked for an 11th day.The restrictions are placing increasing strain on the most vulnerable residents in Kashmir, where there are already shortages of medicines in local pharmacies and workers are struggling to survive.A young man from southern Qazigund town, who works in Srinagar, said he had no money left to feed his family.“I have not been able to find any work for the last 10 days. I don’t have any money left to buy milk for my children. Don’t think I am a beggar, I have a post-graduate degree,” he said, struggling to hold back his tears.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, claimed in his independence day address in Delhi that Kashmir’s previous status had allowed corruption and separatism to fester. The action taken by his government would bring justice to the territory, he said.“The old arrangement in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh encouraged corruption, nepotism” and “injustice when it came to rights of women, children, Dalits, tribal communities,” Modi said in the speech marking 72 years since India achieved independence from British rule.Daily protests have erupted in Kashmir, but the move to assert control over the territory has received widespread public support in other parts of India. “Article 370 should have been removed a long time ago, but better late than never,” Amarjeet Singh, a businessman from Delhi, said. “It is good. Everyone will be benefited by this, because every common man will be able to work there and start business there.”Delhi’s decision strips the disputed state of Kashmir and Jammu of any elements of autonomy, removing its constitution and flag, and scrapping laws that prevented outsiders from buying land. The state will also be split in two. Many Kashmiris fear it will alter the demography of the country’s only Muslim-majority state.India’s foreign ministry officials have said the territory is returning to normality, but there was little indication of that on the streets of Srinagar, which remain under lockdown.Hasina said that armed uniformed personnel climbed the walls of the family home in southern town of Tral at 11.30 pm on Wednesday and asked for Malik. “It was as if they came to arrest a militant,” she said. “They said they wanted to take Irfan along with them. I tried to resist but they did not relent and took him away.”The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspand Pakistan came into being in 1947.Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world\u0027s most heavily militarised borders: the ‘line of control’ based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous ‘princely states’ across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, has been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u0026nbspAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.On Monday 5 August 2019, the government issued a presidential order to abolish Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision was only intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u0026nbspextreme force\u0026nbspin 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca RatcliffeShe has since met him at a police station. “He was very nervous and he feared that they could take him to jail outside Kashmir and no one would know,” she said.Other politicians and activists have reportedly been held in temporary detention centres.The Indian government’s announcement has led to an escalation in tensions with Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir and has fought two wars with India over the region. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, threatened on Wednesday to “teach Delhi a lesson” and vowed to fight until the end against any Indian violations.The country’s army was preparing to respond to anticipated Indian aggression, he said. He has previously compared the Indian government to Nazis and suggested they might carry out ethnic cleansing.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a321d3223ac57ef37dc9f461b1fd08f6c8257f11/0_86_3344_2006/master/3344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c33b3fcdc0434c63eced6a0ec2959e96","title":"uk caught in middle of us power play with iran","story":"Seizure of Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar was welcomed by US hawks but left Britain looking vulnerableWhen Gibraltar’s authorities unexpectedly impounded the Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 in July, one member of Donald Trump’s administration was particularly pleased. John Bolton, the president’s hawkish national security adviser, tweeted: “Excellent news”.The authorities in Gibraltar – with the backing of the British – said the vessel was heading for Syria. Selling oil to the regime of Bashar al-Assad was in breach of EU sanctions.But for the US, the seizure served a wider purpose, first to ratchet up the economic pressure further against Syria and above all Iran. Its cargo, worth $140m (£116m), represented lost revenue for Tehran as well as a lost source of energy for Damascus regime.Caught up in the middle, however, was Britain. Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf in retaliation, under the noses of the stretched Royal Navy, leaving British merchant shipping looking vulnerable in the region, despite UK claims that Gibraltar had acted independently.Britain needed help in the Gulf and under new prime minister, Boris Johnson, chose to turn to the US, abandoning an idea first aired by his defeated leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, who had wanted to create a European-led naval protection force in the world’s busiest oil shipping lane.It was a decision British officials tried to play down when it was announced last week that the UK would “join in with” the US on maritime security in its initiative, Operation Sentinel.But when Bolton came to London on Monday, he was far less subtle. “We were pleased PM Johnson’s government has agreed to participate in Operation Sentinel,” he said, adding pointedly that the move “reflects a change from the prior government”.Hunt and the former prime minister Theresa May were acutely aware of French and German sensitivities and did not want to throw their naval lot in with the US in waters just south of Iran, at a time when all three European powers want to cool tensions with Tehran and keep the nuclear deal negotiated under the Obama administration alive.As for the Grace 1 tanker, Iran had given assurances behind the scenes to Gibraltar that, if released, it would not sail to a country subject to EU sanctions such as Syria, meaning that the continuing detention of the ship was becoming increasingly hard to justify.But with Washington determined to maintain the economic pressure on Iran, the Americans had little choice but to raise the stakes by making a legal challenge to Gibraltar’s decision on Thursday – a policy denounced by Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif as “economic terrorism”.London has acknowledged that the US notified the British authorities of its intentions to try to prevent the release of the Grace 1. But such are the sensitivities, British officials would not say whether Bolton had raised the topic of the tanker in his meeting with Johnson this week, or in any of the other meetings with ministers.It would be surprising, however, if Bolton had not done so. But in any event, Britain has once again has become increasingly embroiled in the US economic power play with Iran, and if the Grace 1 is further detained, the tanker crisis is far from over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1dd39e8043eed037106e568eda18d49bb43a405/0_0_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e62605ef46cbbabc60e551df27ed231c","title":"us moves to block release of iranian vessel in gibraltar","story":"Territory says Tehran has promised oil is not for Syria – but US to contest decisionAn oil tanker at the centre of a six-week diplomatic row between Britain and Iran is to be released from Gibraltar after Tehran promised that its cargo worth $140m would no longer be transported to Syria.The territory’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, said he had agreed to let the vessel go after he had received a written assurance from Iran, but admitted his decision could yet be overturned by a surprise last minute US legal challenge.Iran had promised that the final destination of the tanker Grace 1 “would not be an entity that is subject to European Union sanctions” such as Syria, Picardo said in a statement. That meant there were “no longer any reasonable grounds for the continued legal detention”, he added. Royal Marines seized the vessel off the shores of Gibraltar on 4 July. A court in the territory endorsed his decision to release the vessel, which is carrying 2.1m barrels of Iranian oil worth £116m.Tensions flared after the incident, with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seizing the British-flagged Stena Impero a fortnight later, and Britain sending out a second warship to the Gulf to offer greater protection to merchant shipping.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It\u0027s not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: \u0027If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDonald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats \u0027attempted to impede\u0027 a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row.Picardo acknowledged that the US Department of Justice had indicated it was minded to challenge the decision and said mutual legal assistance authorities would make “an objective, legal determination of that request”.Trump administration officials had earlier told the  the seizure request was consistent with wider efforts to intensify the effects of western economic sanctions on Iran as well as Syria.A US official said the tanker case was significant because it was both an Iranian oil export and, in the judgment of the UK government, a Syrian oil import. “We have an interest in the disruption of both of those, both for our overarching Iran policy and our Syria policy,” the official said.Gibraltar detained the Grace 1 because it was believed to be heading to Syria. Bashar al-Assad’s government has been subject to EU sanctions since the early stages of the country’s civil war. The EU does not sanction Iranian oil exports.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused the US of “having failed to accomplish its objectives through its economic terrorism”. It had “attempted to abuse the legal system to steal our property on the high seas”, he said.British officials said they were notified in advance by the US of the Department of Justice’s intention to challenge the release of the tanker, but they would not spell out when that had occurred.It is not clear whether the US national security adviser, John Bolton, raised the subject when he visited London on Monday and Tuesday and met the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and other cabinet ministers.Bolton had previously been following the topic closely. The senior official had hailed the seizure of the Grace 1 as “excellent news” when it originally took place, and praised the UK for agreeing to work with the US to help safeguard merchant shipping in the Gulf earlier this month.The Foreign Office said it noted the assurances given by Iran that the Grace 1 would not proceed to Syria. “Iran must abide by the assurances they have provided. We will not stand by and allow Iran, or anyone, to bypass vital EU sanctions on a regime that has deployed chemical weapons against its own people,” a spokesperson said.Relations between Iran and the west have been deteriorating since Washington pulled out of an international agreement curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme and reimposed economic sanctions.The UK, France and Germany have been trying to keep the deal alive, but under the pressure of economic sanctions, Iran has been gradually pursuing a policy of defiance, sabotaging shipping in the Gulf and increasing the enrichment levels of its uranium stockpiles in breach of the treaty.During his trip to the UK, Bolton made further diplomatic efforts to steer a post-Brexit UK further away from Europe on a range of issues including the Iran nuclear deal and the role of the Chinese technology firm Huawei.Bolton is hoping that a Johnson administration will gradually adopt a foreign policy on Iran more independent of its two former EU partners Germany and France after Brexit, and closer to the policy of maximum economic pressure on Tehran imposed by Donald Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9bdab32ec65bb22245d29655bab9726d11c6180/0_307_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b96afb42b51d4e3b75877c2fab3c8799","title":"myanmar and bangladesh to start sending back thousands of rohingya","story":"Fresh attempt at repatriations agreed but refugees fear they will return to persecution and violenceMyanmar and Bangladesh will attempt next week to repatriate thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, officials said on Thursday, nearly a year after a major attempt failed.More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine for neighbouring Bangladesh after a military-led crackdown in August 2017 that the United Nations said was perpetrated with “genocidal intent”. However, many refugees refuse to go back, fearing more violence.A total of 3,540 refugees have been cleared for return by Myanmar from a list of more than 22,000 names sent recently by Bangladesh, officials from both countries said. The first group of refugees would return to Myanmar next week, providing any agree to go back. “We have agreed to the repatriation of 3,540 people on August 22,” Myint Thu, a spokesman for Myanmar’s ministry of foreign affairs, said.Previous attempts at persuading Rohingya to return to Rakhine have failed due to opposition from refugees. An effort in November sowed fear and confusion in the camps, and finally failed after refugee protests.A senior Bangladeshi official said the new effort was a “small-scale” repatriation plan, adding that nobody would be forced to return.“Bangladesh wants nothing but a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable repatriation,” said the official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.Mohammed Eleyas, a Rohingya activist with the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, said refugees had not been consulted about the process. Myanmar should agree to the key demands of the community before repatriation begins, he said.UN officials have been asked to assess the refugees verified by Myanmar to determine whether they want to return, according to internal emails by the refugee agency, UNHCR, seen by Reuters. “UNHCR will provide refugees with the relevant and reliable information available on the conditions in Myanmar, subject to current constraint on access in the areas of return,” one of the emails said.A UNHCR spokeswoman referred questions to Myanmar’s ministry of foreign affairs.Tens of thousands of Rohingya remain inside Myanmar, confined to camps and villages across Rakhine state where they are denied citizenship and their movements restricted.The UN has said conditions in Rakhine state, where government troops have been fighting an insurgency for months, are not conducive to the return of refugees.The region has been enveloped in a new war, with government troops fighting Arakan Army insurgents, members of an ethnic armed group that recruits from the mostly Buddhist Rakhine, who make up the majority in the area.A UN investigator said in July that human rights violations against civilians by security forces and insurgents may amount to fresh war crimes, citing reports of deaths during army interrogations.Myanmar authorities have blocked most humanitarian agencies, including the UN, from the area.In July, an Australian thinktank said the government had made “minimal preparations” for the return of refugees. An analysis of satellite imagery showed no signs of reconstruction in the overwhelming majority of former Rohingya settlements, while destruction of homes continued as recently as this year, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said.Min Thein, a director at Myanmar’s social welfare ministry, said officials had been sent to reinforce several centres built on the border with Bangladesh that have sat empty for months.“We are preparing to be ready, cleaning the transit camps, reinforcing the staff levels,” said Min Thein."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f89b58705a70cb1c78b62bd10c2d9d137874901/0_229_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=996b6218e62b4d66890fc301f28dcf51 1300w","title":"shanghais ostracised skateboarders in pictures","story":"Skateboarding will debut in the Tokyo Olympics next year.

Arts at DCU is down from 356 to 347.Arts in UCD has fallen, down from 381 last year to 336 this year. But the UCD humanities course, a four-year degree course introduced last year, is up from 301 to 348 points, suggesting that there is a growing appetite among students for humanities courses which include the work placements and research projects that employers increasingly want from graduates. Maynooth University, which has also shaken up its arts degree in recent years, is only down from 320 to 316.PsychologyMany students will be disappointed to see points for psychology at UCD jump from 501 to 517 points, while DCU’s psychology has risen from 488 to 509 points, the National College of Ireland’s course is up from 350 to 360 points, UL’s psychology course is down by one point to 498 and Trinity’s psychology offering is up from 543 to 565 points. Points for psychology at Dublin Business School, the largest independent fee-paying college in the State, are only up by two, from 242 to 244.LanguagesAlthough industry is crying out for graduates with modern languages, demand for the modern languages course at UCD has fallen for the second year in a row: in 2017, students needed 464 points to get last year, they needed 399 and this year, they need just 368. Applied language and translation studies is down from 388 to 371 points. World languages at UCC, however, is up by one point to 456 while TU Dublin’s languages and international tourism course is up from 298 to 307 points.Social scienceSocial science courses have stayed readily steady. At UCC, points are up slightly, from 387 to 391 points. UCD’s social science course is down from 392 to 390. WIT’s social science course has stayed at 271. But Maynooth’s social course is down by 20 points to 326.JournalismWhile applications are down broadly for courses categorised as journalism, points for DCU’s course are up by one to 401, although points for communication studies are slightly, from 403 to 400.NUI Galway’s journalism offering has also jumped by 22 points, up from 388 to 410 points, indicating growing demand for a course which was the subject of controversy over refunds in recent years.TU Dublin’s journalism course stays steady at 346, Griffith College’s journalism and visual media design shoots up from 193 to 227 points, UL’s journalism and new media course has fallen 22 points to 388 and DCU’s multimedia degree is down 7 points to 403.Agriculture \u0026amp foodSome of the most significant points reductions have been recorded in agriculture courses.UCD’s main course in the area, agricultural science is at 425 (down 26 points), dairy business fell 34 points to 398, food science fell 33 points to 451 and human nutrition fell 26 points to 495.Students wishing to study agriculture science, a new course this year at UCC, will need to meet the 473 points requirement if they are to get in at the first calling.Nutritional sciences at Cork are down 15 points at 492 while food science is 444 down from 452. Food Innovation at Technological University Dublin is at 321, down from 326, while culinary \u0026amp gastronomic science at GMIT is 225 points, down from 244.Culinary arts at Technological University Dublin is 271 points, down from 280 while culinary science remains unchanged at 308.OffersEileen Keleghan, CAO communications officer, has asked applicants to carefully consider any offers received in this round.“One of the common queries that we receive at the offers stage is around order of preference,” she said.“Applicants are reminded that if they receive a lower preference offer they can accept this offer and it will not prevent them from receiving an offer of a course higher up on their courses list in a later offer round if a place becomes available and they are deemed eligible.“Those who have received an offer in this round should consider the current offer as being the only one they may receive."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3942943.1565184548!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what steps you should take as you prepare for the next stage of your education","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhile college will be fun – you will meet a lot of new people and will undoubtedly have the opportunity to pursue your interests whether through joining societies or getting involved in sports or other pursuits, don’t forget that you are there to further your education. Photograph: iStockThe wait is almost over as\u0026nbspthe day of the\u0026nbspmuch-anticipated first round of college offers has finally arrived. No matter whether you receive\u0026nbspthe offer for the course you applied for or didn’t do as well as expected (there are plenty of options still open to you), there are some steps you need to take as you prepare for the next stage of your education.You should have read the CAO Handbook by now and taken note of the important deadlines and restrictions that may apply to you or your course. The CAO advises that applicants must treat all correspondence from CAO as extremely important and notify them immediately (through cao.ie) if there are any errors or omissions recorded in your application documents.1. Make the deadlineIf you receive\u0026nbspthe offer you had hoped for, you will review\u0026nbspyour options and when you are happy to accept your allocated course, then the process is straightforward. As per the CAO’s instructions, you can do so online or by post (but not both). If you accept your offer online, you will receive an acknowledgement email, and you can check that your acceptance has been recorded online at cao.ie via the ‘My Application’ facility. If you accept by post and wish to receive confirmation of your acceptance from CAO, you must include a self-addressed and stamped postcard. Important Note: Round One acceptances must be submitted by 5.15pm on August 23rd.2. Consider your optionsDon’t worry if you didn’t get the course you expected – many don’t. Choices you listed on your CAO form should approximate your interests and accepting a lower-preference course now will not prevent you from receiving an offer of a course higher up on your list in a subsequent round. Note that you can move up your list of preferences, not down. If you don’t accept an offer, however, you run the risk of not receiving any other offers in later rounds. Important Note: Round Two offers will be issued on August 28th from 10am and acceptances must be submitted by 5.15pm just two days later, on August 30th.If you don’t get any of the choices you listed on your CAO application form or have had a late change of mind, there are plenty of other routes that you can take. There are some 30,000 places available in further education colleges throughout the country. Many provide high-quality tuition and on-the-job experience, while apprenticeships offer a chance to earn and learn. Many of these courses also offer an alternative route to attaining a degree in college. The  will publish a special guide to these courses in a special Career Choices supplement on August 19th.4. Take a year outIf you are happy with the course but want to defer your place, you need to act immediately. You do not accept your offer – instead, you must email or write to the admissions office of the university or college. Give your name as it appears on your CAO application, quote your CAO application number and the course code of the offer you wish to defer, and set out why you wish to do so. Note: there is no guarantee they will allow the deferral.5. Prepare for collegeTús maith leath na hoibre! Of course, if this old adage were always true, then everything would be a breeze! Still, the legwork will pay off and now is the time to prepare for the practicalities of college. Things will seem like they are happening at a lightning pace so there’s no harm in being prepared. You could do worse than visit the campus to get a feel for it. Most will provide tours and induction days for freshers, and these are well worth attending as there will be a lot to absorb.The hunt for student accommodation is well and truly under way. If you need somewhere to live, your first port of call should be the college. Places in student halls of residence fill up quickly – many are already full. Your college and students’ union should also have a list of reasonably priced rooms and digs. Privately-run student residences are also an option, though these are expensive. Be sure to check your lease: some private accommodation can exceed the student academic year so be prepared to have to rent throughout the holidays if you wish to keep the keys. Start off by reading our accommodation guide in this supplement.7. Read our study guideWhile college will be fun – you will meet a lot of new people and will undoubtedly have the opportunity to pursue your interests whether through joining societies or getting involved in sports or other pursuits, don’t forget that you are there to further your education. Familiarise yourself with the library, locate your course department and get an understanding early on of what is expected of you – how many essaysexams you need to deliversit.8. Still not sure?

Photograph: Hany Marzouk.Co Galway student Jessica Moore, who died after falling ill at her secondary school debs dance on Sunday, “lived her short life to the full”, her father has told her funeral Mass.Brendan Moore told hundreds of mourners who gathered at St Patrick’s Church in Bullaun on Thursday that the family had since learned that the “focused and determined” 19-year-old scored 531 points in her Leaving Cert. He said Jessica, from Loughrea, had wanted to live and attend college in Galway city but that “all these plans are gone now and all we have our memories”. “We won’t get to share her 21st birthday, or her graduation. I’ll never get to walk her up the aisle, though I don’t know if that was ever going to happen,” he joked. Jessica became ill at a dance in a hotel in Ballinasloe and was taken by ambulance to Portiuncula Hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. Gardaí are investigating the sudden death and were awaiting the results of toxicology tests.Mr Moore said people were aware of Jessica’s talents at singing and performing, which were “her comfort zone, her place of refuge”. He said his daughter was “a complete rogue” with stories of how she snuck out the family home’s window and often debated in school about religion. ‘Top form’Mr Moore said this week was supposed to be “a series of celebrations” which included the Leaving Certificate results and CAO offers. He said his daughter left for the dance on Sunday following “a great day” and in “top form”. “Everything was coming together for her perfectly,” he said. “She will always be our vibrant, funny, quirky 19-year-old who we all loved so, so dearly and we’ll miss terribly.” Mr Moore thanked the medical staff at Portiuncula Hospital, the staff at the hotel where Jessica fell ill, family, friends, neighbours and work colleagues. He also thanked Jessica’s friends from St Raphael’s College who turned up to their home on Tuesday instead of going out celebrating their exam results. “You all are an incredible group of young people who are all capable of achieving so much. Look out for each other as ye head out into that big, bad world and all I ask is that you remember Jess,” he said.Offertory gifts including Jessica’s guitar, a chocolate bar, her keys, a Game of Thrones book and a scrap book presented to Jessica by her friends, which captured her on stage, were brought to the altar.ScienceFuneral celebrant Fr Benny Flanagan said Jessica worked in a local hotel and that when he ran into her last week, she said she wanted to study science in college. He said Jessica’s mother Catherine recalled how Sunday was “the most wonderful family day” with more than 400 photographs taken. He said “a special dress” had been bought online ahead of this week’s events, “which very sadly arrived on Monday”. “She (Jessica) was a character but she was full of creativity and sensitivity and responsibility,” Fr Flanagan added. “Then it happened, she pushed the boat out from shore. She didn’t see or was not aware of the dangerous undercurrents and the sharp rocks just under the surface and the extraordinary winds that were to arise.”A recording of Jessica singing The Foggy Dew was played before the Mass ended and she was later buried at the adjoining cemetery."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3987387.1565884795!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"1969 irish ministers felt military incursion in north could lead to pogroms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJack Lynch: such was the taoiseach’s condition that he was brought whiskey to steady his nervesWhen Fianna Fáil returned to office in June 1969 it would be the last election for three decades in which violence in Northern Ireland would not form part of the political backdrop. At that time, the Troubles described the birth pangs of the State and Bloody Sunday referred to a massacre in Croke Park.After almost three years in office, Fianna Fáil leader Jack Lynch had finally received an electoral mandate but many still saw him as a caretaker taoiseach keeping the seat warm until a more charismatic successor could emerge.While the revolutionary generation were slowly stepping out of the limelight, the cabinets of the 1960s still contained several IRA veterans and Eámon de Valera resided in Áras an Uachtaráin. Frank Aiken, who, as IRA chief of staff in 1923 had ordered republicans to dump arms, retired as minister for external affairs in July 1969 and was replaced by 46-year-old Patrick Hillery, a popular figure within the party, closely aligned with Jack Lynch and considered a likely successor.When the North erupted on August 12th-13th, 1969, Hillery was enjoying a painting retreat on Achill island and for several hours could not be contacted by government officials. Following the Battle of the Bogside, the days of quiet summer holidays for ministers were now well and truly over.The Irish government’s profound interest in the emerging crisis was tempered by its inability to influence the course of events. Hillery had been rebuffed in London when he tried to express government concerns and told by his British counterpart that there was “a limit to the extent to which we can discuss with outsiders – even our nearest neighbours – this internal matter”.But just as the British were telling Dublin to back off, the government was besieged with requests to support the Northern nationalist community.The cabinet meeting of August 13th exposed deep isions on how best to respond to the crisis. Ministers Neil Blaney and Kevin Boland favoured some kind of military response, a position that resonated with a much larger body of opinion outside the cabinet.According to one ministerial adviser, “the entry of a mere company of soldiers ... would have brought Britain to the conference table for the first time in half a century on the basic question of the partition of Ireland”.Midlife crisisAt 43 years of age, Fianna Fáil was experiencing something akin to a midlife crisis. Some in the party sought to recapture the radical fervour of its youth but many were cautious. Long spells in power had made most ministers anxious that Fianna Fáil’s hard-won ascendency should not be squandered on a reckless adventure.For Boland, the tumult in Derry was “the moment of truth” for Fianna Fáil, an opportunity to fulfil its historic mission of uniting the country. Blaney told the cabinet they had “the same right to protect any citizen of the six counties as we would have had if it had happened in Cork”, deliberately referring to the taoiseach’s home county. Others maintained that an army incursion into Northern Ireland would expose beleaguered nationalists to pogroms. In a letter to Boland, party stalwart Seán MacEntee described Catholics in his native Belfast as “hostages for our good behaviour”.The script Lynch had brought to the cabinet on August 13th was dissected and amended beyond recognition. Charles Haughey, who had emerged as an unexpected ally of Blaney and Boland, was entrusted with rewriting the document, which was subjected to further discussion and amendment before being unanimously approved.When Lynch arrived at RTÉ studios, the deputy head of news, Des Fisher, looked at the taoiseach’s almost indecipherable notes and insisted they be typed up and made legible before he went on air.Such was the taoiseach’s condition that Fisher brought him whiskey to steady his nerves. Lynch took the unusual step of asking Fisher what he thought he should do and, in particular, whether he should send the Irish Army into Northern Ireland as some of his advisers counselled.When Fisher answered that he thought they would get about 20 miles into Down or Derry before being massacred by the British, Lynch confirmed that he had reached the same conclusion. However, the taoiseach hinted at some kind of intervention when he told the nation that his government could not “stand by” and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse.A step backWhile officially condemned, the introduction of British soldiers to Derry on August 14th and Belfast a day later allowed Dublin to take a step back. In his television address the taoiseach had said their deployment would be “unacceptable” and not conducive to restoring peace, “certainly not in the long term”. When the troops were sent in the optimists thought they would return to Britain within weeks the pessimists thought they might have to stay until Christmas.A delegation of Stormont MPs, including future SDLP co-founder Paddy Devlin, visited Government Buildings late on the night of August 16th begging for Irish Army intervention. The MPs failed to secure a meeting with the taoiseach.Attempts to procure weapons for the defence of Northern nationalists would come to the fore during what became known as the Arms Crisis, leading to the sacking or resignation of more than a quarter of the cabinet. But that was all in the future."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3987414.1565886233!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why belfast residents want to keep their peace walls","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Dalai Lama crosses the peace line at Workman Avenue and Springfield Road in Belfast in October 2000. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillIn Conway Street in west Belfast, the shadow of August 1969 remains on the walls. On the gable end of a former linen mill the outline of a house survives, its pitched roof and chimney burned into the brickwork.Fifty years ago, Conway Street was burning. Homes in the predominantly Catholic street were attacked by a loyalist mob throwing petrol bombs the RUC responded by baton-charging the Catholic crowd, then sending in armoured cars with heavy machine guns mounted on top. The chaos was repeated in other parts of west and north Belfast, and seven people died.It was the beginning of a mass movement of population which would see previously “mixed” streets redesignated as Catholic or Protestant. Residents were either forced out of their homes or chose to flee, some to refugee camps across the Border.The 1972 Scarman report, carried out by a British judge, later estimated that 179 homes were destroyed in the violence of August 1969, including Bombay Street, which was completely burned down. About 1,800 families left their homes 1,500 of these were Catholic and 300 Protestant. In total, up to 15,000 people would be displaced in Belfast in the first 10 years of the Troubles.Temporary barricades which were thrown up amid the violence hardened into permanent lines of demarcation: the so-called peace walls which still ide Belfast’s streets to this day.One of the best-known runs past Conway Street along Cupar Way, separating the Catholic Falls from the Protestant Shankill. Corrugated metal sheeting, its green paint reminiscent of Troubles-era security installations, reaches high into the air. It is topped by an even higher wire mesh, to block missiles.Tourist attractionFurther along, this wall is a tourist attraction. More and more visitors come every year to see the murals of Bobby Sands, Nelson Mandela and others on the “international” section of the wall along the Falls, or to visit the Troubles’ memorials on the rebuilt Bombay Street.Here, black-taxi tours deliver carloads of tourists with clockwork regularity. “I’d love to talk to you, but I’ve another tour in an hour,” more than one guide explains to The .A group of Americans stand on a bench, to get a better view of the wire mesh which protects the back of the houses overlooking the peace wall. A metal frame extends from the bottom of their roofs across to the back fence and down to the ground it resembles nothing so much as a cage.“Doesn’t bother me,” one resident says. “We’re used to it. I’d rather have the wall there. It keeps us safe.”This is an oft-repeated sentiment on both sides of peace walls. In Madrid Street, in east Belfast, the ide is easy to miss. A mural celebrating the history of women in the area overlooks a small garden, with high hedges behind. Here is, in fact, a peace wall, separating the Catholic enclave of the Short Strand from the Protestant areas off the Newtownards Road.Roseanne Thompson lives a few houses away. She says she has been injured in rioting, and a friend had her arm broken. Her house has been attacked with paint bombs and other missiles, and her children’s toys destroyed in the back garden.“The peace wall is better staying up. I don’t want it taken down,” she says. “We had a questionnaire coming round asking us how we’d feel if the peace wall came down. I’d be away because it’d just be murder on the street.”On the other side of the wall lives Brian McMullan. He points out damage to his front door where it was hit by a missile thrown over the wall. “My view, that wall stands as long as I’m alive,” he says. “I have peace and quiet when that wall is there.”In the past, the Short Strand interface has been a flashpoint. The Madrid Street wall was erected relatively recently, in 2003-2004. The local church, St Matthew’s, has a mobile peace fence, dating from 2013, which can be raised and lowered as the situation demands.Strategy planThat same year, the Northern Ireland Executive’s Together: Building a United Community strategy plan aimed to remove all peace walls – or “interface barriers” – by 2023. This now appears optimistic, not least in the continued absence of a devolved government in Northern Ireland, and the communities that live near peace walls remain among the most deprived in the North.Of the approximately 80 peace walls in Northern Ireland, the vast majority are in Belfast. About 15 of them are in Housing Executive hands, though some of these – such as Madrid Street – have been “re-imaged” as part of a strategy to change perceptions around peace walls.Consent is key. A Housing Executive spokesman explained that any work “is undertaken at the pace of each inidual community and only in circumstances where residents feel safe and confident in removing these symbols of segregation”.On the Crumlin Road in Ardoyne in north Belfast, the change is evident. Three years of negotiations between residents in Catholic Ardoyne and Protestant Woodvale, “until residents felt comfortable taking down this physical and mental barrier”, led to the Housing Executive’s first removal of a peace wall in 2016.“We believe through these community-led projects we can create peace by building respect and trust instead of walls made of bricks and mortar,” a spokesman said.Today, the Crumlin Road is as unremarkable as any main road. There are houses on one side, a nursing home on the other, and plenty of traffic whizzing past. Nobody would guess that there was once a peace wall here."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3987445.1565894949!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"french authorities looking at jeffrey epstein s exploits in paris","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  The walls of Jeffrey Epstein’s apartment on Foch Avenue in Paris  were covered with photographs of naked young women, according to a worker.

The walls of his Paris apartment were covered with photographs of naked young women, according to a worker cited in 2,024 pages of US court documents released on August 9th.A former assistant to Epstein told Libération newspaper there were often several young women in the Avenue Foch apartment, fewer than in Palm Beach, where “there were eight or 10 at a time”.Epstein’s contacts book was published by the US website Gawker in 2015. It contained a section titled Paris Massage, with dozens of women’s first names and mobile phone numbers.‘Prostitution network’A group called Innocence en Danger says it has evidence that “several victims of the prostitution network created by Epstein and his accomplices are of French nationality”.Two French citizens figure in the US court documents as the main procurers of young women for Epstein. They are Ghislaine Maxwell and modelling agency executive Jean-Luc Brunel.Maxwell is the daughter of the disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell and his French wife, Elizabeth. \u0026nbspEpstein’s chief accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, claims Maxwell, who was Epstein’s former girlfriend, recruited her to be Epstein’s sex slave when she was a 16-year-old working at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Maxwell sued Giuffre for defamation. They settled out of court in 2017.Giuffre claims Maxwell and Epstein “gave” her to Brunel, as well as “politicians, university professors and people from royal families”.Brunel has been implicated in previous scandals. He headed two modelling agencies, Karin and MC2, in which Epstein invested $1 million. Two women quoted in the US court documents say Epstein used Brunel to recruit girls as young as 12, for himself and “especially for Jeffrey Epstein”.Maritza Vasquez, who was Epstein’s accountant, testified that he gave Brunel the use of apartments on East 66th Street in Manhattan to house models. Brunel flew often on Epstein’s planes, and made himself at home in Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion.In a 1989 episode of the US programme 60 Minutes, two Paris models accused Brunel of having drugged and raped them. An investigation by the programme alleged that Brunel and a fellow agent sexually assaulted nearly two dozen models. Brunel denied the claims. Former modelsLibération and the investigative website Mediapart interviewed former models Zoë Brock, from New Zealand, and Thysia Huisman, from the Netherlands. They met Brunel in 1991, when Brock was 17 and Huisman had just turned 18.On arriving in Paris, Brock was lodged in Brunel’s apartment in the Avenue Hoche, allegedly for her own safety. Brunel returned from a trip abroad and told her she would have to sleep with him, she says. She says that she managed to avoid him but that he spread the rumour she was a drug addict and her work dried up.In the aftermath of Epstein’s death, US and French media have gone to great lengths to contact Maxwell, now aged 57, and Brunel, in his 70s. Both have gone to ground, and no one is sure of their whereabouts."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?UK weather: Flood warning as England braces for month\u0026#39s worth of rain in one dayNHS to scrap standard health MOTs for over 40s Donald Trump says \u0026#39fantastic and big\u0026#39 trade deal with UK is \u0026#39moving along rapidly\u0026#39Cricket umpire hit on head by ball during match dies in hospital\u0026#39Silent stroke\u0026#39 risk from major surgery revealed in new studySeven teenagers arrested as father stabbed to death with screwdriver in NewcastleUK \u0026#39won\u0026#39t say no\u0026#39 to a deal with Huawei, says founder as he calls Boris Johnson a \u0026#39very capable person\u0026#39Comment: Leaving with no deal isn’t a betrayal of the British people, but trying to stop it isSarah Wollaston accused of hypocrisy after backing by-elections for defectorsGhislaine Maxwell spotted out in public for the first time since 2016More students go straight to clearing as Russell Group universities drop grades to take extra applicantsWind farm behind massive blackout awarded £100,000 in compensation day after powercutUniversity watchdog set to intervene over unconditional offers, as students receive their A-level results Philip Hammond on collision course with local Conservative members over Brexit stance Comment: Woodstock marked the shift from community towards self – and we\u0026#39re still dealing with the fallout todayUS prosecutors want to speak to second British woman linked to Jeffrey Epstein scandalMore than 100 A-level entries classified as \u0026#39gender neutral\u0026#39, as exam boards allow students to opt out of boys and girls categoriesRoyal Opera House to go ahead with Placido Domingo performances in wake of sexual harassment allegations\u0026#39Hollywood Ripper\u0026#39 guilty of murdering two women including Ashton Kutcher\u0026#39s then-girlfriendHuawei employees \u0026#39helped African governments spy on opponents\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"a level results day 2019 students across country receive results","story":"A-level students across most of the country received their results today, with the majority of subjects redesigned to exclude coursework and modules.

Ford, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State and one of the leaders of the research team.Nasa reveals final image Kepler Space Telescope took before it diedWe want to use those discoveries to improve our understanding of planet formation and to plan future missions to search for planets that might be habitable. However, simply counting exoplanets of a given size or orbital distance is misleading, since it\u0027s much harder to find small planets far from their star than to find large planets close to their star.To try and understand how many of those planets might be out there waiting, scientists came up with a new method to help estimate how many planets might have formed. They developed a model that allowed them to create new, imaginary universes of stars and planets – and then watch to see how many of those would have been picked up by the Kepler Space Telescope, and how many would have been missed.We used the final catalogue of planets identified by Kepler and improved star properties from the European Space Agency\u0027s Gaia spacecraft to build our simulations, said Danley Hsu, a graduate student at Penn State and the first author of the paper.By comparing the results to the planets catalogued by Kepler, we characterised the rate of planets per star and how that depends on planet size and orbital distance. Our novel approach allowed the team to account for several effects that have not been included in previous studies.Scientists can now use the findings to comb through the rest of the universe looking for planets that look like our own, with the hope of launching a major mission to study them. How ambitious that mission needs to be will depend partly on just how many planets there are waiting to be found, and so the discovery will help decide the scale of that search.The researchers found that there are probably planets like our own – between three-quarters and one-and-a-half times as big as our planet, and similar length years – waiting to be found around roughly one in four stars.But they also worked out how accurate that estimate could be. The potential uncertainty means that missions should plan to find such worlds as often as every two stars, they suggest.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And should we be worried?What’s going on in financial markets?A closely watched indicator has signalled that the markets are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the future\u0026nbspof the US and UK economies.Market indicator that preceded last 7 US recessions flips againTraders and economists are concerned that that the yields are\u0026nbsphigher for short-term bonds than for bonds maturing further away in the future. That is unusual as investors generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.The last time it happened in the US was in 2007.They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds. This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.It implies first of all that investors, fearing for the future, are looking for safety. US stock markets have fallen sharply as risky assets like shares have been sold off in favour of bonds which are government-backed and pay a fixed return.It\u0026nbspalso signals that investors think a recession is due which would prompt central banks - in this case the Federal Reserve and Bank of England - to cut interest rates in the future.How concerned should we be?Major economic downturns in the US, but also in other advanced economies, have usually been preceded by this economic indicator.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK hard.But there have also been examples were the\u0026nbspyield curve inverted but no recession followed, such as in the UK in the early 2000s.In the past there has also been a significant lag of around 10 months to three years between this indicator and a subsequent recession.Why has this happened?News on both the UK and US economies has been pretty negative of late. Under Boris Johnson the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen sharply and last week we learned that the UK economy had unexpectedly shrink in the last quarter. This week, inflation came in higher than expected.The US outlook is being damaged by trade tensions with China which have seen the Trump administration hit the majority of Chinese imports with tariffs. Beijing has responded in kind with its own tariffs on US imports.Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, said the latest inversion of the yield curve said more about the global economy as a whole than the US in particular.“We are looking at Germany, we are looking at, above all, China and we are going, ‘This isn’t good, these are meant to be motors of global trade’.”China\u0027s latest figures show that industrial output grew much weaker than forecast.So how worried should we be?We should be wary, but not panicking.The US yield curve is not a failsafe predictor of recession. And there are various technical reasons why it may be distorted at the moment.Yet the voices arguing that the global financial system is not yet safe are credible and should be heeded\u0026nbspregardless of whether or not we are about to enter a new global recession.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like other garden cities, the idea was to enhance the sense of community for the workers escaping the slums. Multiple families lived in one building, with private garden plots for\u0026nbsptenants, and courtyards in which to gather.Jyri Engestrom, a Finnish entrepreneur, grew up in Kapyla. When he was young, every house had a grocer or a shop beneath, catering to residents. These days, all the businesses have closed down as the buildings have been converted to attractive residences, populated by creatives. With few communal resources, Kapyla\u0026nbsprisks becoming a neighbourhood where people come home from the city to watch TV in the evening, never talking to their neighbours. Apart from two months every summer, when Engestrom opens the door to Cafe Siili.Siili, which means hedgehog in Finnish, is\u0026nbspintended to be more than a neighbourhood cafe. It is a place for locals to gather and a focal point for the area. Engestrom hopes it can restore some of the sense of community in the area.“Our fortune, in the next decades, will be intricately connected to our community structure,” he says one sunny afternoon in the front garden of the cafe. “A place like this is not just about vegan food or recycling waste but allowing people to rely on each other as we face the challenges of climate change.”Cafe Siili is one of 81 Helsinki businesses participating in a programme by the city government to help local consumers make more environmentally sustainable choices. Think Sustainably\u0026nbspmeasures participating businesses against\u0026nbspcriteria that includes vegan, organic and fairtrade dishes (for restaurants) and using electricity from renewable sources. Consumers can use the website and the app to choose restaurants, shops, events, experiences and accommodation according to this criteria, then see CO2 emissions-free public transport routes to get there.View this post on InstagramSiili juhlii juhannusta perjantaista sunnuntaihin, jolloin kahvila on kiinni.

Värikästä keskikesän juhlaa Siilin ystäville! #helsinki #happinessA post shared by  Kahvila Siili (@kahvilasiili) on Jun 19, 2019 at 7:39am PDTTia\u0026nbspHallanoro, director of brand communications and digital development at Helsinki Marketing, says the service has been developed in response to local concern about the climate crisis. She points to the results of a survey showing that two-thirds of local people believe climate change is the biggest threat to their lives in the future.\u0026nbsp“Many feel frustrated that there’s nothing they can do to stop it,”\u0026nbspHallanoro\u0026nbspsays. “There’s a great demand for the frustration to be channelled into something productive that allows us to rethink our lifestyle and consumer patterns. As a service,\u0026nbspThink Sustainably\u0026nbspgives you concrete tools for that.”Laura Aalto, chief executive at Helsinki Marketing, describes Helsinki as a “test bed” for solutions that might be scaled up to other cities. She says the city’s small size, well-developed infrastructure and strong knowledge economy makes it well-placed to effect change that other cities might later be able to adapt and harness. “Helsinki is eager to experiment with policies and initiatives that would not be possible elsewhere,” she says. “We hope that others can learn from our experiments.”Engestrom believes that sustainability is about more than just recycling waste and offering vegan dishes. He trained as a sociologist and believes that the\u0026nbspstructure of communities directly affects their ability to survive in crisis conditions.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s the day after an entrepreneur gathering at the cafe, and Engestrom talks animatedly about an app called Gubbe.io, which connects elderly people with younger locals, to create jobs, stave off loneliness and help older people live longer in their own homes.\u0026nbspEngestrom knows a thing or two\u0026nbspabout creating communities. In 2006 he founded Jaiku, a Finnish social networking, microblogging and streaming service, comparable to Twitter. In 2007, it sold to Google for an undisclosed amount. With his partner, the Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake, Engestrom cofounded Yes VC in 2018.This venture capital fund has invested $6m\u0026amp in businesses, according to Engestrom.

Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute?

As the Bank of England noted in June, British companies were not the only ones stocking up on components and goods – firms in the EU did the same.\u0026nbspBrexit also threatens the German economy later this year.\u0026nbsp“There may be another boost to German exports to the UK ahead of the next Brexit deadline,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbsp“However, we suspect that any pre-Brexit boost would be smaller than it was in the first quarter and it could prove to be the prelude to a larger hit to external demand towards the end of the year if the UK does actually leave the EU without a deal.”Brexit has already contributed to a 0.2 per cent drop in Britain’s output between April and June, as the original date for the UK’s departure affected annual shutdowns of\u0026nbspcar plants, while uncertainty ahead of the new, October deadline weakened most parts of the economy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But reality is more complicatedClick to followThe IndependentIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

As a result, risky assets such as stocks have fallen out of favour and investors have been parking their money in safer government bonds, with treasuries traditionally seen as the safest.As longer-dated treasuries normally provide better returns, they have been particularly popular. But demand has driven prices up and, as yields move in the opposite direction, they have dropped and the curve has inverted.\u0026nbspThe same flip in the yield curve of UK government bonds reflects investors’ concerns about Brexit, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbsp“Brexit could be a very drawn-out, protracted drag on the economy in the worst-case scenario,” he said. Because of the risk of no-deal Brexit, investors think the Bank of England will keep interest rates low in the medium and long term to support the economy, and these expectations are pulling down yields on longer-dated gilts, Mr Tombs added.\u0026nbspHe also noted\u0026nbspthat the yield curve has not always been a reliable harbinger of UK recessions.“There were a few times in the mid-2000s when the curve inverted or nearly inverted and yet the economy was still doing OK.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

due in no small part to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and amplified by the impact of weather and tracking against national sporting events in the same period last year.As a result our non-food business has been challenged during the period, however we\u0027re satisfied that our food business has continued to perform well and our online growth continues to outpace the market.Despite all this, Asda\u0027s\u0026nbsptotal sales were up 1.3 per cent\u0026nbspIn the three months to 30 June.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s coverage of today\u0027s business and economic events.\u0026nbspMore than half of farms will go bust if\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0026nbspforces through a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit,\u0026nbspfarmers\u0026nbspare warning, as some join the campaign for a fresh referendum.A deadly cocktail of immediate\u0026nbsptariffs, border checks, increased red tape and cheaper food imports from outside the EU will result in the “decimation of UK farming”, a detailed study finds.Read the full story here from our deputy political editor Rob Merrick:Brexit: Farmers call for fresh referendum as they warn half of farms will go bust after no-deal exit\u0026nbspThe UK has been told by the American farming lobby that it must accept US standards such as allowing chlorinated chicken and the sale of genetically modified crops as part of a post-Brexit trade deal.\u0026nbspZippy Duval, head of the American Farm Bureau, told the BBC\u0026nbspthat fears about US practices were not science-based.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspYou know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine, Mr Duvall told the BBC\u0027s Today programme.So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away.If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that, he added.The US has already laid out what it is looking for from a trade deal with the UK:\u0026nbsphttps:ustr.govsitesdefaultfilesSummary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\u0026nbspIt specifically does not like EU measures it deems to be not science-based.\u0026nbspIn trade speak:\u0026nbspObtain commitment that the UK will not foreclose export opportunities to the United States with respect to third-country export markets, including by requiring third countries to align with non-science based restrictions and requirements or to adopt SPS measures that are not based on ascertainable risk.\u0026nbspSPS measures  food hygiene standards\u0026nbspWorth noting that while US farmers may not believe a ban on chlorinated chicken is science-based, there are far more cases of salmonella per person in the US than in the UK.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could force more than half of British farms out of business, farmers are warning.\u0026nbspWhy?\u0026nbsp* The EU, plus third countries with which it has trade agreements, would immediately slap tariffs on food exports from the UK.*\u0026nbspTariff-free imports of many agricultural products\u0026nbspwould have to be offered to non-EU countries as well, including the USA, Brazil and Australia – undermining domestic farming* It would also be hit by new non-tariff barriers, including administrative costs and border checks to ensure compliance with EU food safety and animal health regulations.* It would face an effective trade embargo on exports of animal-based products, while the UK and the EU negotiated an agreement.* The removal of support payments – with only a proportion likely to be covered by Whitehall – and an adverse trading environment will “render the majority of farm businesses unviable”.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the competition watchdog has called for the break-up of two recently-merged medical technology firms after finding the deal could lead to the NHS and charities paying higher prices.Sweden-based Tobii bought UK rival Smartbox for £11m last year, but the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has now ordered Tobii to sell off the business.The announcement comes after an investigation by independent CMA panel members concluded that the tie-up could result in a reduction in quality, less new product development, and higher prices.\u0026nbspPress AssociationIn the markets, the FTSE 100 has opened up 0.5\u0026nbspper cent down at 7,115.53.\u0026nbspTobacco companies are the biggest climbers, RBS and B\u0026ampQ owner Kingfisher are the worst performers.\u0026nbspEuropean stocks are stabilising after fears of a recession sparked a sell-off yesterday.UK retail sales grew in July, lifted by a surge in online sales, according to official data.\u0026nbspThe quantity bought last month rose 0.2 per cent compared with June, defying economists’ forecasts for a 0.2 per cent drop. Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute?

its lowest point in 12 years to 25.5 per cent, which was almost 1 per cent less than last year, amid major exam reforms.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the proportion of students who scored the top grade of A* also fell to 7.8 per cent this year – its lowest level since 2013 – compared to 8 per cent last year.Exam boards attributed the decline in the top marks to a shift in students’ subject choices towards those which are traditionally considered more difficult – including the sciences.A growth in the numbers taking A-levels this year could also be behind the trend, they added. \u0026nbspBut the overall A* to E pass rate was 97.6 per cent, unchanged on last year, the national figures published by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) revealed.This is the third year that\u0026nbspstudents\u0026nbspin England have received grades in a number of\u0026nbspreformed A-levels, which have moved away from coursework and modules to final\u0026nbspexams\u0026nbspafter two

at the top grades this year after two years of males doing better.The proportion of girls who got an A or A* higher was 25.5 per cent, 0.1 percentage points higher than boys (25.4 per cent).But on A* grades alone, boys performed better, with 8.2 per cent of entries getting the highest result, compared with 7.5 per cent of girls’ entries.Dr Philip Wright, director general of the JCQ, said the picture shown by the results was “stable”.He said: “It is particularly encouraging to see the rise in young women being inspired to take science A-levels. For the first time female entries have overtaken male entries in the sciences.”How to get a university course place through Clearing on results dayTop A-level grades drop to lowest proportion in more than decadeStudents need just 55 per cent for A grade in maths A-level this yearOn Thursday, England’s exam regulator Ofqual announced an investigation into the grading of last summer’s maths A-level – which was the first time the new exam was sat by students.It is understood there are concerns that grade boundaries set last year may have been too high.Students who took the A-level in 2018, which was fewer than 2,000, could see their results changed.The figures released on A-level results day also revealed that Spanish has become the most popular foreign language, with 8,625 entries compared to 8,355 for French.Meanwhile, the number of entries to political studies and geography rose this year – and a growing interest in climate change, Brexit and US politics could be behind the trend, exam boards said.But the number of A-level students choosing to study arts subjects and English has continued to fall, prompting concerns about the arts sector being in danger.Michael Dugher, UK Music CEO said: “This year’s A-level entry numbers reveal a deepening crisis facing music in education that needs urgent action from the government.“There is yet again a worrying drop in the number of people studying music to A-level, which seriously jeopardises the talent pipeline on which our industry relies.As the A-level results were published, separate figures revealed that fewer students have been accepted on UK degree courses this year.The\u0026nbspUcas\u0026nbspdata shows that 408,960 students, from the UK and overseas, have taken up university places in the UK – down 1 per cent on the same point last year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

hoped other funding methods can be found in future to continue the programme, with the help of outside investors.The identities of the students supported by the scheme have been kept secret to ensure they have a normal life during their studies, although the grime star keeps track of their academic progress.Announcing the second year the scholarship is running, Stormzy said: “There are so many young black kids all over the country who have the level of academic excellence to study at a university such as Cambridge - however we are still under represented at leading universities.Ed Sheeran\u0027s new collab with Stormzy is getting a lot of loveBilly Bragg accuses Morrissey of sharing \u0027white supremacist video\u0027Stormzy replaces A$AP Rocky as Open’er Festival headliner after arrestStormzy apologises to Skunk Anansie for erroneous Glastonbury claim“We, as a minority, have so many examples of black students who have excelled at every level of education throughout the years. I hope this scholarship serves as a small reminder that if young black students wish to study at one of the best universities in the world, then the opportunity is yours for the taking - and if funding is one of the barriers, then we can work towards breaking that barrier down.”The University of Cambridge’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stephen Toope, said: “Stormzy is an inspiration, not just for his music but for his engagement on social issues and encouragement of young people. He has achieved great success in his career, but recognises that this was at the expense of his studies and the option of a place at a top university.“He wants to inspire talented young black people who have their sights set on university to follow their dreams. The scholarships are a beacon for black students who might otherwise have felt they could not come to Cambridge.”He added: “Last year, 61 new black students arrived to take up their courses at Cambridge, the largest number ever but not nearly as many as we would like. We know we need to work harder to ensure that black students not only apply to study at the university, but that they feel at home here and achieve their full potential.”Last year Stormzy said Oxford University had rejected his offer to fund two scholarships there.“We tried Oxford but they didn’t want to get involved,” he said. The university later said it would welcome the chance to work with him.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half.

As the Bank of England noted in June, British companies were not the only ones stocking up on components and goods – firms in the EU did the same.\u0026nbspBrexit also threatens the German economy later this year.\u0026nbsp“There may be another boost to German exports to the UK ahead of the next Brexit deadline,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbsp“However, we suspect that any pre-Brexit boost would be smaller than it was in the first quarter and it could prove to be the prelude to a larger hit to external demand towards the end of the year if the UK does actually leave the EU without a deal.”Brexit has already contributed to a 0.2 per cent drop in Britain’s output between April and June, as the original date for the UK’s departure affected annual shutdowns of\u0026nbspcar plants, while uncertainty ahead of the new, October deadline weakened most parts of the economy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As such, it is unclear how Apple will choose to name them.The current line-up is made up of the iPhone XS, which is the luxury version the XS Max, which is the same but bigger and the iPhone XR, which is cheaper but in the middle of the sizes.The new phones are rumoured to have the same rough structure, which has led to questions about how they could be named. Apple could stick with the roman numerals and name the new phone XI, for instance, or could drop the numbers in the same way as it did with the iPads.But a new series of reports suggest that the new phones could actually be called the iPhone 11. The luxury version is rumoured to be called the iPhone 11 Pro, according to the same reports, and the bigger version is due to keep the Max branding.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

It is in keeping with a whole host of reports, however, many of which have discussed the possible Pro branding.Using the Pro name would bring the phones in line with the iPad, Mac and MacBook, all of which use the word to mark out the most high-performance and high-price versions.Case companies often act on leaks from within Apple\u0027s supply chain, as they rush to get their products ready for the launch of new phones, meaning that their designs can often be an early indication of the details of unreleased products. But they have been known to be wrong in the past, especially with the naming and branding of products, which can be changed at the last moment.Apple is expected to unveil the new phones in the second week of September, at a media event that will be broadcast around the world.

They are hugely experienced and, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, or indeed myself, they are not seeking to lead a government in the long term.”But Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, issued a video message urging Ms Swinson to rethink, saying: “Jo, please change your mind. Jeremy Corbyn has done the right thing.”Anti-Brexit farmers herd sheep along Whitehall in protestThis is what Brussels insiders told me about a no-deal BrexitJohnson admits chance of no-deal Brexit no longer ‘a million to one’Ministers to spend £300m on emergency supplies after no-deal BrexitUrging the Lib Dem leader to join talks, Ms Lucas added: “Let’s have that negotiation with him and not reject this offer out of hand.”Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National Party leader, echoed the call, saying: “Jeremy Corbyn’s suggestion is not the only possible option – but given the circumstances, nothing should be ruled out at this stage.“It’s no secret, I’m not the greatest fan of Jeremy Corbyn, but we won’t rule out any option if it helps avert what is a looming catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit.”Senior Tories Dominic Grieve, Caroline Spelman and Sir Oliver Letwin issued a joint letter, with former Conservative Nick Boles, welcoming talks, but did not endorse the Labour leader as a stopgap in No 10.But Anna Soubry, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, said: “I would not support a government of national unity that is led by Jeremy Corbyn for all manner of reasons.”Mr Bebb’s endorsement of a Labour prime minister – even a temporary one – is certain to trigger calls for him to be stripped of the Conservative whip.The StandUp4Brexit campaign of grassroots Tories was furious, saying: “Are MPs like Guto collaborating with the EU in a vain attempt to overturn Brexit, and to hell with the consequences for British democracy?”\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

As a result, risky assets such as stocks have fallen out of favour and investors have been parking their money in safer government bonds, with treasuries traditionally seen as the safest.As longer-dated treasuries normally provide better returns, they have been particularly popular. But demand has driven prices up and, as yields move in the opposite direction, they have dropped and the curve has inverted.\u0026nbspThe same flip in the yield curve of UK government bonds reflects investors’ concerns about Brexit, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbsp“Brexit could be a very drawn-out, protracted drag on the economy in the worst-case scenario,” he said. Because of the risk of no-deal Brexit, investors think the Bank of England will keep interest rates low in the medium and long term to support the economy, and these expectations are pulling down yields on longer-dated gilts, Mr Tombs added.\u0026nbspHe also noted\u0026nbspthat the yield curve has not always been a reliable harbinger of UK recessions.“There were a few times in the mid-2000s when the curve inverted or nearly inverted and yet the economy was still doing OK.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Her tweet has been shared thousands of times and received more than 500 replies, many vociferously defending the school and the government.Mr Modi’s government announced on 5 August that it was unilaterally revoking Kashmir’s autonomy, its ability to make its own laws and prevent outsiders from settling in the Muslim-majority valley, as well as the downgrading of Jammu and Kashmir from a state to two directly-controlled union territories.Since the day before the announcement, the region has been on lockdown amid fears of an angry backlash. Kashmiri politicians and locals accuse the government of trying to force demographic changes in\u0026nbspthe Muslim-majority region.Created with Sketch.Pakistan shoots down Indian fighter jets:

It has downplayed reports of unrest in the region.In an interview with The Independent, the woman who first tweeted about the now viral homework assignment said she was concerned about the way the task\u0026nbspwas framed, and that the issue was “too difficult for students as young as 11-12 to be able to grasp”.She shared a screenshot of a homework app which read: “All students have to write a letter in Hindi, to PM of India, thanking PM for removing Article 370 in J \u0026amp K (Jammu and Kashmir)”. The app said the letters were to be brought in ahead of India’s Independence Day celebrations on Thursday.Hansraj Public School is part of the largest non-governmental chain of schools in India, the DAV College Managing Committee (DAVCMC), which says it runs more than 900 educational institutions across the country.On Tuesday, media in Odisha state reported that schools in the network were being asked to produce open letters approving of Mr Modi’s decision on Kashmir.Draft letters called the revocation of Article 370 an “historical decision” that would “end the terrorism”, and praised Mr Modi’s “able and astute leadership”. Schools were ordered to collect teachers’ and parents’ signatures and return the letters urgently. Copies were also reportedly circulated to students.The woman whose 11-year-old brother received the Haryana homework assignment, who asked to remain anonymous, said she could “hardly believe they\u0027ve given such a heavily biased assignment on a political issue”.“Rather than being asked to write about their thoughts on the issue, which is often how school assignments are presented, they were being instructed on what to think as well,” she told The Independent.Modi vows to restore Kashmir\u0027s \u0027former glory\u0027 amid Pakistan warningThe journalists chronicling events at a crossroads for KashmirSupplies run low as Kashmir blockade goes on for ninth dayPakistan cuts ties and suspends trade with India over Kashmir disputeModi is betting his legacy on ‘solving’ the issue of KashmirHer parents had decided to write to the school explaining he would not be completing the homework, she said.The woman asked to remain anonymous because of the heated arguments the tweet had provoked online, and for fear of repercussions for her brother at school.In less than 48 hours, the original tweet received more than 10,000 likes and retweets and hundreds of replies varying from outrage at the assignment to personal attacks on the woman herself.Many expressed support for Mr Modi.

in an earlier address from the ramparts of Delhi’s Red Fort Mr Modi said his government’s move to revoke\u0026nbspKashmir’s\u0026nbspstatus\u0026nbspwas a piece of “fresh thinking” that would return the restive region to its “former glory”.Wearing a flowing, saffron-coloured turban, Mr Modi made no reference to the security and communications lockdown that has brought Kashmir to its knees for 11 days.Mr Modi told the audience that the revocation of Article 370, the constitutional clause that allowed Kashmir to make its own laws and prevent\u0026nbspoutsiders settling in the valley, would see the region contribute to India as a whole becoming a $5-trillion economy “in the coming years”.He said Kashmir’s special status had fuelled separatism, encouraged corruption and discriminated against women and non-Muslims.\u0026nbspModi is betting his legacy on ‘solving’ the issue of Kashmir“The old arrangement in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh encouraged corruption, nepotism and there was injustice when it came to rights of women, children, Dalits, tribal communities,” he said.“Today every Indian can proudly say ‘One Nation, One Constitution’.”Kashmiri locals and politicians fear that the unilateral move to strip the region of statehood and special protections is designed to result in demographic change, flooding the picturesque, fertile valley with Hindu settlers. Critics have likened it to the policy of Israeli settlement in Palestinian territories.But Mr Modi accused the domestic opposition raising such concerns of “playing politics”, and claimed that previous heads of government had not dared to act on Kashmir because they feared for their own careers.“I don’t care about my political future. For me, the country’s future comes first,” he said.The journalists chronicling events at a crossroads for KashmirSupplies run low as Kashmir blockade goes on for ninth dayKashmir mosques remain closed for Eid amid Indian security crackdownIndian PM Modi says Kashmir changes will ‘free it from terrorism’Modi is betting his legacy on ‘solving’ the issue of KashmirIn the rest of his 90-minute address, Mr Modi used the backdrop of the Mughal-era fortress to announce a significant step for India’s armed forces – the creation of a US-style chief of defence staff (CDS).The role, to be filled by a four-star general from either the army, navy or air force, will see one person coordinate all three branches of India’s military and become the sole point of contact with the prime minister.Such a move was recommended back in 1999 by a government panel, after perceived military failures allowed Pakistani forces to occupy parts of the Himalayan range near Kargil and led to an 11-week conflict that could have spilled over into all-out war.Mr Modi said the new CDS would “further sharpen coordination between the forces”.Members of the audience for Mr Modi’s address, which came on a national holiday as India celebrates\u0026nbsp72 years since it won independence from Britain, were unsurprisingly supportive of his move regarding Kashmir.“Article 370 should have been removed a long time ago, but better late than never,” said Amarjeet Singh, a businessman from Delhi.“It is good. Everyone will be benefited by this, because every common man will be able to work there and start business there,” Mr Singh said.\u0026nbspA complete shutdown of all mobile phone, landline and internet connections, meant there was little word from Kashmir itself on how Mr Modi’s speech was received.\u0026nbspThe Indian government finally admitted on Tuesday that there had been some protests and clashes, but said security forces acted with “restraint”.The government said on Wednesday that the restrictions have now been eased in the Hindu-majority Jammu region of the state.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we should all rejoice in that.DAMNING new statistics reveal the average wait for a non-urgent GP appointment is now more than two weeks.This is simply not good enough.Boris Johnson promised in his first speech as Prime Minister that it was his job to make sure we don’t have to wait for weeks on end to see our doctor.The latest figures highlight the enormity of that task.There is a limit to what can be achieved by under-pressure health service staff and, though the PM has moved quickly to free up extra funding, there will never be an endless supply of money for the NHS, no matter who is in No.What is needed is serious reform and some radical thinking.Jeremy Corbyn will doubtless oppose any new ideas and continue using the NHS as a political football.Butthe Prime Minister can prove as single-minded on the health service as he is proving on Brexit, there is still hope.VAR made its Premier League debut on the opening weekend of the new season and had an instant impact.In spite of teething problems, it’s great to see the right decisions being reached by the video assistant referees — but fans should not be left in the dark while it happens.Refs should be mic’d up, like in rugby, so supporters can hear what’s going on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were security checkpoints in every city centre street, bag searches in most shops.In my teenage years, when I attended school in the west of Ulster, one of my fellow pupils was killed in the infamous IRA bomb attack on Lord Mountbatten’s boat off the Irish coast in .Two years later, the terrorist and hunger striker Bobby Sands was briefly my MP before his self-inflicted death, an event that provoked more rioting.Despite the ruthlessness of the IRA, the British security forces never wavered in their duty.Even in the face of mortal danger from petrol bombs, stones and even bullets, the soldiers did not buckle.In the cauldron of historic animosities, stoked by the venom of the IRA, they showed impressive forbearance, undermining the Republican propaganda about British oppression.There were disastrous failures, however, like the loss of discipline at Bloody Sunday in Derry, , when British paratroopers fired on a group of protesters, killing  of them.Over the years, their tenacity gradually wore down the enemy, particularly through the use of sophisticated military intelligence.Towards the end of the s, the entire IRA network was riddled with British agents.Even Frank Scappaticci, the Republicans’ own head of its feared Internal Security Unit – known as the “Nutting Squad” - was alleged to be an informer.Such deep penetration made it almost impossible for the IRA to carry on using the bomb and the bullet effectively .By the close of the Troubles, British security forces were estimated to be foiling two out of every three planned IRA operations.One former IRA man, now a Dublin solicitor, admitted, “It was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.”It was a defeat that heralded a new era in Northern Ireland.In practice, the peace process was a declaration of surrender by the IRA.Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not suddenly see the light and become peaceniks.They embraced democratic politics because they recognised that their terror movement, beaten by the British forces, could no longerproperly.After the Good Friday Agreement of , the Republicans agreed to decommission their weapons without achieving any of their key political aims. Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom, while the partition of Ireland continues.For political reasons, the British army has never received the credit it deserves for its remarkable victory.In the new climate of co-operation, there is an understandable wish to avoid any triumphalism.But what is reprehensible is the persistent hounding of British veterans who bravely served their country in the Troubles, but are now the subject of official inquiries into past misconduct.No fewer than  of these veterans are said to be currently under investigation, despite endless pledges from politicians about an end to the grotesque witch-hunts.The gross betrayal of their service is bad enough, but even more offensive are the double-standards, for the Good Friday Agreement facilitated the early release of scores of terrorists, as well an amnesty for many on the run.If the peace process is meant to draw a line in the sand about Ulster’s dark past, it should apply to everyone.Thanks in large part to the efforts of the British army, the future should be bright for Northern Ireland.But clouds are gathering, due to suspension of the devolved assembly and concerns about a hard border because of Brexit.The fragility of the situation means that British politicians should tread carefully, respecting the rights of both communities in the province, as well as the interests of Dublin, our closest neighbour.But the Tories have done anything but that.Having thrown away their majority in , they have formed a dubious alliance with the DUP, a reactionary outfit which presents itself as the voice of Ulster but in fact won only  per cent of the vote at the last election.As cheerleaders for unionism, the Conservatives now talk about “our precious union”, while regrettably Boris Johnson has even given himself the additional title of “Minister for the Union.”Whilst many Brits feel passionate about keeping the union together, this rhetoric may not be what Northern Ireland needs.The British Government is meant to be an honest broker rather than a partisan advocate for one side.“Rigorous impartiality” was central to the success of the Good Friday Agreement. For the sake of harmony, that spirit cannot be allowed to disappear.The campaign in Northern Ireland may not have had the glamour of victories like Egypts El Alamein or Waterloo, but it was still one of the British army’s greatest achievements.It would be a tragedypast military determination were to be squandered by present political bungling.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They loved their daughter, she was an angel, he said.But they are now concerned about the truth because they owe that to Nora, what happened, how did she die.The familys lawyer also stated that Malaysian authorities may tend to favour the theory of a disappearance over the criminal hypothesis in lieu of Malaysias good image for tourism.Noras grandfather, Sylvain Quoirin insists on criminal activity and called the authorities disappearance hypothesis absurd.She wasnt there [during previous searches]. Someone put her there, to get rid of her, he said.The post-mortem ruled the teen had died from internal bleeding in her intestine after a stomach ulcer burst, following a period of prolonged hunger and stress.Negeri Sembilan Police Chief, Mohamad Mat Yusop, today said authorities had found no evidence of foul and said the post-mortem also found she had not been sexually abused.The officer told the Malay Mail that the area where Nora was eventually found had been searched and she may have been moving around as rescue teams tried to locate her.“We will continue to investigate and find out what really happened,” he said.The window was also open in the room that Nora had been sharing with her two siblings.August : Missing persons charity The Lucie Blackman Trust says that Malaysian police are treating Noras disappearance as a potential abduction, but officers deny there is any foul play involved.August : Noras family say they believe her to have been abducted.She never goes anywhere by herself. We have no reason to believe she wandered off and is lost.August : Police say they are analysing unidentied fingerprints an open window and in a downstairs hall  found in the familys hotel suite.August : Police investigate whether footprints found in the forest where Nora went missing belong to the missing teen. Her family say she wouldnt have wandered off on her own.August : Noras family thank the search teams involved since the teenagers disappearance.August : Hundreds of rescuers still involved in the search operation a week after she disappeared.August : A visibly emotional Mrs Quoirin makes a further appeal for her daughter tohome.Nora is our first child. She has been vulnerable since the day she was born.She is so precious to us and our hearts are breaking. We are appealing to anyone who has information about Nora to help us find her.A reward of £, - donated by an anonymous Belfast business - is made available for information leading to Noras safe .August : A body is found and police said Noras parents confirmed it was her .August : An initial post-mortem examination inconclusiveAugust : Post-mortem finds that Nora died of intestinal bleeding after a stomach ulcer burst, probably caused by hunger and stress.Vulnerable Nora - who was born with the brain defect holoprosencephaly - is believed to have been dead for up to three days before being found in a spot search crews had already examined.Prior to the post-mortem findings, French prosecutors had joined the probe - as Noras father is French - to investigate whether the teen was kidnapped before her death.Mr Morel told Le Parisien that the parents had filed a complaint “for kidnapping and were convinced her disappearance is of criminal origin.Her family paid tribute to the youngster and also thanked people across the world for their support.Nora has brought people together, especially from France, Ireland, Britain and Malaysia, united in their love and support for her and her family.To all our friends and family at home, we cant thank you enough for all your love.Nora is at the heart of our family. She is the truest, most precious girl and we love her infinitely. We will always love our Nora.It is understood Nora had been wearing underwear when she went missing – but police said when she was found she was “completely naked”.The officer who has been leading the hunt, Datuk Mazlan Mansor, said she was found in a stream running through a ravine, adding: The stream was about .km deep in the ravine,” he said.A volunteer taking part in the search, Sean Yeap, revealed that the body had not been covered in any foliage.This is known as peritonitis.Peritonitis can very quickly spread and trigger sepsis or blood poisoning, before spreading to other organs and causing organ failure.If left untreated, it can prove fatal.Ulcers can be caused by a range of things, from H.pylori bacteria in the digestive tract to certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen.While its not a direct cause, extreme stress can make an underlying ulcer worse and make complications like perforation more likely, according to the Mayo Clinic.Noras parents visited the site where her body was found and later identied her body at the Tuanku Jaafar Hospital.The teenager was discovered missing from her bedroom at the Dusun eco-resort in southern Negeri Sembilan state on the morning of Sunday August , with the window left open.She was on trip of a letime with her family including sister Innes,  and brother Maurice, eight, at the time of her disappearance.The teen had only arrived the day earlier with her parents and two siblings at the resort in a nature reserve near Seremban,  miles south of the capital Kuala Lumpur.Noras parents are an Irish-French couple who have lived in London for about  years.The Dusun is a -acre orchard resort next to the Berembun Forest Reserve -

and the injection is for the animal, not humans.Cat allergies are usually caused by the protein Fel d , which is found in cats skin, saliva and urine.When a cat licks itself clean, the saliva dries on its fur and soon becomes airborne - this can trigger an allergic reaction in  per cent of people.A team of Swiss scientists have come up with a vaccine known as HypoPet AG, which works by “immunising cats against their own major allergen, Fel d .In a study, to be published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, they found the jab signicantly reduced the amount of harmful protein produced.The team analysed data from four separate studies involving a total of  kitties and said all went on to produce antibodies needed to destroy the protein.Researchers say they are “pressing ahead with registration studies and discussions with European and US regulators” to bring the drug to market, which would certainly change lives.They said: Both humans and animals could profit from this treatment.Allergic cat owners would reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases, such as asthma.Their cats could stay in the households and not need to be relinquished to animal shelters.The team hope that the vaccine could be available within the next three months.Dr Gary Jennings, CEO of HypoPet AG, said in a statement: We are very pleased to publish this data which shows our HypoCat vaccine is able to produce high levels of antibodies in cats and that these antibodies can bind and neutralise the Fel d  allergen produced by the animals.“This work was a key step in the milestone-driven [the] development of HypoCat, the lead project in our product pipeline.“We are pressing ahead with registration studies and discussions with European and US regulators with the hope of bringing this much-needed product to the market."},{"url":null,"title":"mum left left baby in 70c car distracted shopping kids","story":"Holli Platt, , says she got distracted by her excited children rushing off to shop at a Target store in Arizona, USA leaving her baby in the car for  minutes before a concerned onlooker broke the car window.Police who arrived at the scene learned that a baby was crying and sweating inside a parked car, with scorching outside temperatures of C.Horried officers say the temperature inside the car could have gone up  degrees while the baby was locked in the vehicle, making the interior temperature around C.A concerned onlooker who spotted the distressed baby broke the window of the car and removed the baby under advice from a  dispatcher.Platt did not arrive back at the scene until after her name was called out on a tannoy, and left her other three children inside the Traget store.Reviewing CCTV footage, police say Platt left the baby inside the car for approximately  minutes.She was arrested at the scene and charged with child abuse.Almost , kids have died in hot cars in the US in the last  years.Hot car deaths account for around  child deaths in the US every year, with rapidly changing climates and freak heatwaves increasing the danger.This summer alone, several horric child deaths have been reported after innocent kids were left alone in sweltering cars.One-year-old twins Luna and Phoenix tragically died after they were left in a car in C heat for eight hours in New York.And a mum once named Teacher of the Year was charged with murder after allegedly leaving her disabled daughter to die in a hot car for more than five hours.In a tragic accident, another mum killed her two-year-old daughter after leaving her locked in a parked car on her driveway as she took a midday nap -

It was a bit of a shock, to be honest.“I looked down and it was like a little alien baby because he was such a big baby too. I burst into tears.”Zoe’s fiance Stuart Grigg captured the amazing moments on camera — from lb oz Finley being pulled out to the doctors taking off the sac.Teacher Zoe, , said of her hefty son: “They just left him there in the sac for a few minutes — apparently it’s good for them. We just sat and watched him. It was incredible to see . . . bizarre but amazing.”Warehouse assistant Stuart, also , added: “Zoe can be a bit ­squeamish but it didn’t bother me at all. Luckily she couldn’t see too much of it.“They let him stay in the sac for about two minutes before bursting it.“It was amazing to see him in there. It’s a special moment anyway but this made it more incredible.“He does look quite strange in the photos, though — it was a bit crazy.”Finley is now ten months old — pictured left with mum Zoe — and was born at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, last October .Babies born in the sac are said to be “en caul” and are meant to be very lucky. In sailor folklore the tots are said, ly, to be unable to drown.Some sailors even used to keep a baby’s sac on board as a lucky charm during voyages.Zoe, from Blackwater, Hants, joked: “Finley does love swimming and he’s good at it — I’m not surethat has anything to do with it.”Stuart, , chipped in: “I don’t think he can breath underwater like the myths say.”Finley and sister Lyla, three, will be pageboy and flower girl when their parents marry next February.Zoe recalled: “I didn’t have an easy birth with Lyla either. She had shoulder dystocia, so her shoulders got stuck. That’s why I had a C-section with Finley. They’re great, happy children.”Dr Pat O’Brien, consultant obstetrician and spokesman for The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said being born in a sac would not have harmed Finlay.WHILE kittens almost always arrive in the world inside their own amniotic sac, it’s much rarer for human beings to be born this way.The pressure during labour usually ruptures the sac, or “caul”, so only one baby in every , is born inside one.It’s a bit more likely in premature births — although Finley was full term — and is usually harmless because the membrane is easy to remove.In many cultures, being born with a caul is thought to bring luck or special powers.He explained: “It’s a very unusual occurrence but there are no known risks to mother or baby.“It’s more common in premature babies because they are smaller. The amniotic sac is more likely to stay intact during a vaginal birth, too.“Once the baby is delivered, there is no benefit in keeping the sac intact. If the baby starts trying to breathe, he or she must be removed from the sac to get some air.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It just erupted.Its all fun until you have to clean up the mess.After the ordeal, the dermatologist then described the leftover puss as camembert oozing out of the mans back.She admitted it had an odour which reminded her of old fondue.A cyst is a fluid-filled bump that forms just underneath the skin. It is common and harmless and can go away without treatment.However, sometimes they can swell up and require medical treatment. They look like a round, dome-shaped bump and is yellow or whitish in colour.They dont usually hurt but will become tender, sore and redthey get infected.Why do they form Cells in the top layer of our skin produce a protein called keratin that helps give skin strength and flexibility.Normal, these cells move up to the surface of the skin as they start to die, so they can be shed.But sometimes these cells can move deeper into your skin and multiply, forming a sac.They secrete keratin into the middle of the sac, which forms a thick, yellow paste.This can ooze out of the cystit is burst.Anyone can get a cyst, but you are more likely to get oneyou have gone through puberty, have a history of acne or you have injured the skin.How are they treated If they are small and not bothering you then they can be left alone.Holding a warm flannel against the skin can encourage it to heal and reduce inflammation. But dont be tempted to pop it because that will increase your risk of infection.If your cyst is bothering you then it can be cut out by a GP.They will numb the area with local anaesthetic, make a tiny cut in the skin and squeeze the cyst out.Danny, who suffers from cystic acne and has struggled with the growth since he was a teenager, admitted to occasionally scratching the with a pasta drainer when they get too much.He said: I cant resist sometimes.I sit there and Im a bit bored so I put my hand over, feel round andI feel its a bit...

Now he uses his bus pass to get about, supports more than  charities and is on a mission to take on the bad bosses ruining the good name of business. Putting his money where his mouth is, he has just handed over % – £.million – of his shares in hi-fi chain Richer Sounds to the workforce. Each of his  employees will receive £, for each year with the retailer – an average payout of £,. Listen to Richer rail about what is happening in this country and you would think he’s a card-carrying ­Corbynista, rather than one of the ­country’s most successful entrepreneurs.    “Our society is in an awful place at the moment,” he says. “I think the inequality, the injustice, the austerity is terrible. “Fourteen million below the poverty line, including four million children, and four million of those in work – that’s a disgrace. One and half million in ­destitution, who cannot even afford the basics. We should be ashamed.” We meet in Mayfair, London, but Richer is more worried about people living in places like those at the other end of the Monopoly board. “There are so many things wrong with society at the moment – . million on zero-hour contracts who can’t get access to private housing because landlords won’t give them the time of day,” he says. “Three million homes for social housing needed. We are locking , asylum seekers up every year without judge or jury. It is outrageous. The criminal justice system is falling apart. Prisons are bursting, with the highest levels of suicide, self-harm and assault we have seen in our le time.”  Richer, , started wheeler-dealing at private school in Bristol. By the time he was , he had opened his first Richer Sounds selling consumer electronics and was driving a Rolls-Royce. At one point he even had a Lear jet and two helicopters. “Now I cycle and get the Tube and I have a bus pass since I turned ,” he says, grinning with enthusiasm. “I get to take the bus for free. Fantastic!” Not only does he not sound like your traditional businessman, he makes a point of not looking like one. He is dressed in tight black jeans and sports a s prog-rock hairstyle. He was a drummer in a band called Ten Millennia for several years, but that has been put on hold. Worth an estimated £million according to the Sunday Times rich list, Richer, who has been married to former model Rosie since , says he is proud to pay his taxes in full and he wants others to do the same. He estimates the tax gap – the dference between the amount owed to the Government and the amount collected by HMRC – is as much as £billlion.  He won’t name names, but he’s not impressed with “giant internet retailers”, landlords who use offshore trusts to cut their inheritance bills, or celebrities who use offshore tax systems to pay less to the Exchequer. He is also appalled by how a few bad businesses give decent bosses a bad name. At Richer Sounds he believes he has created the template for responsible capitalism and now he wants other firms to follow his example. Handing over control of the company to the workforce was not only the “right thing to do” – he now also sleeps better at night, he says. “People have gone bust around me,” he points out. “Comet, Maplins and hundreds of independents. We are mercilessly under fire from the internet but we are flourishing. I really believe the way we have treated our colleagues has benefited the business hugely.” He gives an example: Richer Sounds owns  holiday homes, including four overseas in Venice, Amsterdam, Barcelona and Paris, that staff can use for free. “Over % of our entire workforce use the homes at least once a year for free holidays,” he says.  “We are turning over the thick end of £million and shrinkage [a retail term meaning theft by staff] should be between £million and £million. But our shrinkage is .% [£,]. So that’s millions of pounds a year saved, which pays for the holiday homes many times over.” Richer set up Tax Watch to shine a light on firms that do not pay their fair share of tax in the UK, and is also ­separately funding a legal test case to try and stop the use of zero-hours contracts. The third plank of his crusade to improve capitalism is to get firms to sign up to a Good Business Charter, containing  “commandments” ranging from paying the living wage to using ethical suppliers. Richer says: “Responsible capitalism is better for society and ­better for business,” adding that it is time to “move the dial ­culturally”, so that tax avoiders are ­vilied rather than lionised. “The scumbags who don’t get it and want to live offshore and exploit their staff and rip off their customers and not pay any tax – the state needs to be much firmer with them. I love paying tax within reason, as long as every other so-and-so is paying it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains youngest surviving twins meet","story":"NewsBritains youngest surviving twins meet helicopter heroes who helped save their livesJenson and Ruben Powell were born weighing the same as half-a-bag of sugar after their mum Jennie, , went into labour at just  weeks while on holiday in Cornwall with -year-old husband RichShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  AUG NewsJennie and Rich Powell with their twin boys Rubenand Jenson, who are celebrating their first birthday by meeting HM Coastguard crews for the first time \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain’s youngest-surviving twin boys have met the helicopter crew who helped save their lives.

She was on holiday in Cornwall with husband Rich, , when the birth started towards the end of their break last August. They rushed to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro where doctors said Jennie needed to go to a specialist neo-natal unit.

She said of her twins: “It really is a story of hope and miracles.” “I felt some pain, and just knew that something wasn’t right. “Everything that followed, in the days after that, we can only describe as miraculous. Every decision made by the people who were looking after us ensured that our boys survived.”  Marketing manager Jennie, from Brighton, praised the Cornish maternity team for spotting the danger signs. They treated her with steroids to provide the babies with support for their underdeveloped lungs. Medics also quickly realised the care Jennie and her boys needed was not available in Cornwall.She said: “When the John Radclfe Hospital said they could take us we found ourselves being airlted by HM Coastguard.” Captain Jorg Brunner, co-pilot Ivan Hamilton, chief crewman Ian Copley and winchman Niall Hanson took Jennie and midwe Jane Parke to Oxford.  Jennie said: After that day the helicopter crew didn’t have any idea about what had happened – that the boys had survived. Being able to meet them again on the anniversary is so wonderful.” They were taken immediately to neonatal intensive care. “We were being prepared for the likelihood of saying goodbye to another child,” said Jennie. Ruben had his first le-saving operation after his intestines began failing when he was eight days old.

It’s asyou’ve said you smack them or make them sleep in the shed. What a terrible mother I must be. I was even called “wicked” by another mum for it. But here’s the sweet truth, or should that be tooth...I don’t like my kids gorging on sweet stuff and I shouldn’t be ashamed of it. Sugar causes obesity and tooth decay and I’d rather they had neither, thanks very much. So when I heard schools could become sugar-free zones under plans to beat decay, I was thrilled. Since my children Josh, seven, and Leah, five, have been at school, I’ve been horried at the constant barrage of sugar-laden treats heading in their direction. Teachers sometimes give them out in class for good behaviour. What happened to gold stars  Next thing, they’ll be giving out chocolate buttons for turning up. h decay has reached epidemic proportions. We are seeing more and more children needing extractions of permanent teeth that have decayed. As a grandparent, I’m shocked at the amount of sweets given out at schools and at parties.Despite considerable resistance from relatives and friends, we didn’t let Sara or her brother have sweets or fizzy drinks regularly – and neither has fillings. There are healthy alternatives, it’s not about depriving kids. The problem with sugar at school and nurseries is it is on the teeth for hours. It also gives kids a sugar rush. The trauma of doing a filling on a four or five-year-old is something you wouldn’t want a child or parent to experience. I’ve got young patients needing root canal treatment. I fully support making schools sugar-free – they are there to educate children, not ruin their teeth. Schools can help by interacting with dental practices to educate about diet and tooth care. Teeth are for le.   Chocs and lollipops are constantly doled out as prizes at school discos and events. Cakes and biscuits are requested for end- of-term parties. This sugar fest is not necessary. Parents should be in control of how much sugar their kids eat, not schools. Every time there is a birthday the kids run out of the school gates with their hands already deep in a packet of Haribo given out by some well-meaning parent. I tend to swipe them away, stick them in a cupboard “for the weekend”, then throw them away once forgotten. The same thing happens at Halloween and Easter. Shame on me. At a PTA meeting I nervously suggested banning sweet treats. Parents and teachers shot me down in flames straight away. Teachers worried about backlash from parents while one mum blasted me as “really mean” for not allowing Josh to hand out sweets on his birthday. “How can you do that to him ” she pleaded, aghast. Josh gave out novelty pencils instead and I swear the kids were perfectly delighted. Sweets, dare I say it, are dull.  Schools profess to promote healthy eating, so why not be consistent  I refuse to give out sweet cones at parties – guests instead get books or games. Party bags my two bring home from friend’s birthdays are emptied of the sweets. They can keep the toys. If they are handed a lollipop at a party, restaurant or shop, we smile and say thank you, then they go straight in the bin. Josh and Leah know the drill – it will be something to tell their therapists when they’re older. Once Josh did say: “Mummy, no one really ate your cake at the school bake sale. They preferred the cookies with dolly mixture on top.” Funny that. The PTA should have been grateful it was a normal cake, not the sugar-free banana muffins I gave Josh on his first couple of birthdays. I’ve had plenty of abuse for my view – called “over-the-top”, “neurotic” and on a couple of occasions, yes even “wicked”.  I’ve had to ignore plenty of eye rolling and peer pressure from relatives and friends. Some people genuinely think I’m giving my kids a terrible childhood, deprived of all joy. Assweets represent the peak of all happiness. Asmy children are weeping into their pillows every night, wondering what they ever did to deserve such punishment. But please don’t feel bad for them. No need to call social services. As the daughter of a dentist, I was rarely allowed sweets and my parents and I are still just about on speaking terms. “You’ll thank me one day,” my dad always said. He was right. But it’s not a total ban. Now they are older I no longer switch blueberries for birthday cake at pals’ parties or water for squash. But treats are not a daily occurrence. We don’t have squash at home and their teeth always get a good brush after the odd packet of sweets, chocolate, seaside ice cream or sugar-hyped party.

A private clinic used textured implants by manufacturers Allergan - which were recalled worldwide last month due to alleged links to cancer. Have you suffered from boob job agony  Email webnews@mirror    She is one of hundreds of UK women to develop a condition called breast implant illness- symptoms of which include chronic fatigue, pain, cognitive and auto-immune problems. BII is not recognised as an illness by the NHS, but thousands of women with implants have reported symptoms like Kate, who is now saving up to have hers removed.Kate has experienced chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, joint pain, anxiety, dizziness, heart palpitations, headaches , irritable bowel syndrome and swollen lymph nodes.The daily agony for the past three years has cost Kate her job and she can no longer compete in bikini fitness competitions.    Kate, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: Iaposm devastated that my implants have done this to me. I opted for the safest ones possible, and yet theyaposve completely destroyed my body. I have been begging doctors for help for years and none of them connected my pain to my breast implants.It wasnapost until I saw people talking about it on social media that I even heard of the illness, and after joining a Facebook group of women suffering just like me, I finally felt like I wasnapost alone.Personal trainer Kate was in the greatest shape of her le when she went under the kne in December . She said her new breasts gave her the confidence she needed to start entering fitness competitions in .  Over the next five years, Kate placed top in  fitness competitions, taking home an impressive  PRO athlete cards and  trophies. Kate said: Breastfeeding and training in the gym had made my boobs non existent, and the breast implants helped my confidence soar. I loved my boobs - they gave me the proportion I was after and looked amazing in fitness photo shoots. They still look beautul, but theyaposre killing me and I feel like I have no choice but to have them removed. Kate began experiencing symptoms of the illness in , four years after her surgery. The young mum has suffered with chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, joint pain, anxiety, dizziness, heart palpitations, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome and swollen lymph nodes for the past three years. Desperate for answers, Kate repeatedly visited doctors for help but could not find a solution for her constant pain. She said: Doctors didnapost know what to do with me. They sent me for screenings on my kidneys and liver, but it all looked normal. My heart was monitored due to my heart palpitations and I was even sent to a gynaecologist to seeI was going through menopause. They werenapost finding anything, but when I suggested breast implant illness could be the cause, I was completely dismissed. Itaposs so frustrating.  But as the illness took control of Kateaposs le, she was forced to stop competing in  and give up full time work, and is now working part time as an online fitness coach. Last month Allergan recalled their breast implants due to an alleged link to a rare form of cancer, hundreds of women have been left with the implants inside them. Breast Implant Associated-Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphonais a rare but highly treatable form of cancer that can develop around breast implants. Symptoms include persistent pain and swelling around the breast implant, with fluid usually developing eight to  years after the implant has been inserted. Kate is now saving up another £, to have the breast implants removed in a private clinic. She hopes to have them taken out in October  when she will also be tested for BIA-ALCL. She said: Doctors warn you that you could die on the operating table, but nobody told me that my implants could be linked to cancer. I have been suffering in pain with no help for years, just like many other women, and to now find out about this link to cancer is devastating. I paid £, for these implants, and now I have to save it all up again to get them removed just so that I can try to live a normal le without constant pain.  Breast implant illness is real and I suffered for years thinking I was on my own. Women need to know the risks of getting implants and that they donapost have to live in agony. The manufacturing company Allergan issued a worldwide recall on their Biocell textured breast implants earlier this months after being linked to BIA-ALCL. The global pharmaceutical organisation recalled the implants after the US Food and Drug Administration released information linking them to the rare form of lymphona. Links between BIA-ALCL and breast implants were originally identied by the FDA in , but new information has pointed to a direct connection between Allerganaposs products and signicant patient harm. Allergen did not want to comment on Kateaposs allegations, but in a statement on the recall, the company said: Allergan PLC today announced a voluntary worldwide recall of Biocell textured breast implants and tissue expanders.

Scotsman John Maxwell was arrested after he was seen throwing the water at other passengers sat near him, including children. He then threatened cabin crew who intervened. The -year-old appeared in court today where he was handed a £, fine. During the mid air confrontation on board the nine hour TUI flight from the Dominican Republic to Manchester, Maxwell squared up to two airline stewards and said: aposDo you want trouble  what’s your problem  Who the f**k are you to tell me what to do ’ His boorish behaviour left youngsters in tears with staff suggesting the pilot of the aircraft consider erting the , mile fight from Punta Canta to the nearest airport. But cabin crew - helped by an off duty police - eventually restrained Maxwell using a restraint kit kept on board the aircraft to deal with troublemakers.  Maxwell was arrested when the plane carrying  passengers, including  children under the age of  plus five infants, touched down at Manchester Airport. He denied being drunk and claimed eye witnesses had conspired against him. But in a statement airline steward Richie Warren said: Mr Maxwellaposs menacing and aggressive behaviour left me feeling uncomfortable and anxious throughout the flight. He was clearly under the influence of something. Some children were crying and this is the first time that I have had to use the restraints in  years. It caused a lot of distress on board the aircraft and I am just grateful that other passengers have helped out. He should not be able to get away with this sort of behaviour.  At Manchester magistrates court, Maxwell, of Markinch, Glenrothes, Fe, had faced up to two years jail after being charged with being drunk on aircraft. However prosecutors accepted his guilty plea to the lesser offence of threatening behaviour under the Air Navigation Order . He was also ordered to pay £ compensation to Mr Warren plus £ in costs and surcharges. The maximum sentence he could have faced was a £, fine. The incident occurred on January  this year whilst Maxwell was ing home following a holiday on the resort town near the Caribbean. Prosecutor Jane Deakin said: At around quarter to midnight a passenger came to the rear galley to speak to crew about a passenger acting erratically and swearing and arguing with his friend, he appeared to be agitated and twitching and clapping his hands. At .am the passenger ed and said the male was throwing water at surrounding passengers including children. He was spoken to as his language was unacceptable but he then turned his attention to two of the cabin crew.  Ashe was going to square up to them he said: ‘Do you want trouble  what’s your problem  Who the f**k are you to tell me what to do ’ Surrounding passengers then had to be moved and into crew seats or wherever they could find seats. The pilot was contacted to ert the aircraft but it was not possible and the authority was given to use the restraining kit. The crew and passengers applied the restraint kit. He was compliant to start with but then began to swear and continued to make threats to the cabin staff and due to him being on a quiet aircraft could easily be hard by the victim. The defendant was sat by an off duty officer until the end of the flight and continued to try intimidate the victim by shouting out his name. When they landed the police boarded and arrested the defendant. The court heard Maxwell had a previous conviction of assault on a police officer plus other public order offences. His lawyer Ian Cochrane said: He was originally charged with drunk on an aircraft but he never accepted that. He was not under the influence of alcohol - and that was clear from the what he said in his police interview.

But,  years ago today, the response from the authorities was to send in the cavalry who cut down peaceful protests in St Peter’s Field, Manchester, with sabres. Eighteen people were killed and hundreds more injured during the Peterloo Massacre, a landmark moment in British political history. These were the days before photography had been invented, but incredibly  years later in ,  Peterloo veterans – all Oldham weavers and by then in their s and s – were gathered together for a stunning picture. Just as they had been in , they were still calling for reforms to extend voting rights. Historian and genealogist Michala Hulme has tracked down their living descendants to recreate the image.  Using historic census data, family trees and electoral records, she was able to locate living relatives of nine of the , and brought eight of them together to make a modern version of the image. Many are still based in the North West but others travelled from North Yorkshire and Warwickshire for the photo. And all are proud of their ancestors’ heroic battle for the vote. Kirsty Wolstencroft, who still lives near Oldham, attended the photoshoot with her father and two children, is the four-times great-granddaughter of silk weaver Thomas Chadderton . She said: “I’m proud that someone in my family had taken a step towards democracy and for people’s right to vote.” Geoff Woolley, , from Alderley Edge, Cheshire, is great-great-grandson of weaver John Davies . He is the only one of the descendants who was already aware of the photo and his connection to Peterloo.  He said: “I’m proud of the fact that the family were part of something helping to get the vote.” On August  , around , people marched for up to  miles from many surrounding towns and villages to St Peter’s Field in Man­­chester to protest. Voting rights were restricted to male adult landowners, and the introduction of the Corn Laws meant the price of food rocketed, putting mill workers on the bread line. But the Lancashire mill folk weren’t going to take it lying down. Thousands of them marched from Bury, Stockport, Rochdale and Oldham to hear radical orator Henry Hunt speak. But the authorities were uneasy. Worried about the uprising of the working classes, magistrates called in the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt, and the th Hussars to disperse the crowd. According to the Oldham Chronicle, the  photo was taken on a Reform demonstration in Failsworth, likely to support the passing of the  Reform Act which unormed the franchise between those who lived in counties and boroughs.

On Friday we could see wet and windy weather with further outbreaks of rain and coastal gales into the weekend. There should be some sun and showers on Saturday, but with a risk of thunder across the country. The warnings we have for Saturday are for  to mm of rain in the North and Wales. This unsettled weather is due to the jet stream in the Atlantic filtering low pressure towards us. By Tuesday and Wednesday next week we should see things settle down and western England and Wales should see some better weather.  High pressure is due to build in the south by the end of the month and we should be heading back to more seasonable weather conditions particularly in the South East.

The harrowing image has increased fears for the welfare of the -year-old elephant after we told yesterday how she was forced to walk miles in shackles during religious parades in Sri Lanka. TV and radio presenter Nicky Campbell has joined the chorus of voices calling for Tikiiri to be properly cared for. Campbell, , who campaigns for animal rights, said: “It is sickening that such cruelty can be inflicted on this beautul, sentient, sensitive, old lady – in the name of religion. “After all she’s gone through she should be taken out of her misery, given a chance to live out the rest of her days being properly looked after. “All her le she will have been thinking of her mother and family and why on earth she ended up in this hell. She needs our help – now.”  Amid the outcry, John Amaratunga, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Tourism, said he had instructed vets to visit Tikiiri immediately.He said: “I have been informed the elephant had collapsed. I sincerely hope that the elephant will recover soon. “Considering what has transpired, I have ordered officials to initiate an inquiry into this matter to ascertain how and why an elephant in such poor health was used in the perahera [pageant] and to take necessary action against those responsible.” He was also appointing a team of vets to inspect the health of all elephants in captivity in Sri Lanka. But when we approached the Sri Lankan High Commission in London we were told Tikiiri was healthy and only appeared to have collapsed because she was struggling to stand up after a nap. A spokeswoman said: “She had been sleeping the previous night and from the sleep she was unable to stand up. ­ Generally, elderly elephants don’t sleep lying down because sometimes they can’t stand up after that. I’m not an expert on elephants but I believe that, as practice, they sleep standing. “The government is very much committed to animal welfare.”  In response to the Mirror’s visit, the Sri Lankan government later looked into the case and released a further update, which insisted: “The elephant participated in the pageant only once.” When the custodians of the Vishnu Devale temple had seen Tikiiri was “unwell” they had taken “immediate action” to remove her from the pageant “in consultation with the owner”.The statement said: “The elephant was provided with veterinary care and her condition and welfare looked into. “According to Sri Lankan cultural tradition, the elephant is considered a noble animal, and there is a long-standing symbiotic relationship between elephant and human in Sri Lanka, where the elephant and its well-being is respected by the people.” "},{"url":null,"title":"blether when local lad norrie joined forfar after spell at dundee united","story":"Continuing to look back on the information which appeared in newspapers when local footballers signed for senior teams.From March ,  . . .Dundee United last night transferred -year-old centre-forward Norrie Porter to Forfar Athletic.The youngster joined United early last season after having a short spell at Liverpool, and in the past year was also on loan to Montrose.All of his appearances with United were in the reserve side, although this season he was unable to get a regular place.No fee was involved and the player has now joined his former Tannadice team-mate Bryn Williams at Forfar.Then – two years on – from May , , came another cutting . . .News from Station Park, Forfar, is that Norrie Porter and Bryn Williams have been given free transfers at their own request.Loons boss Kenny Dick also intimated that striker Davie Cunningham had signed for English side Southport."},{"url":null,"title":"cup draw tayside derby set as dundee united face arbroath with dundee to host elgin city","story":"Dundee United and Dundee will both have the home advantage in the Tunnock#s Caramel Wafer Cup third round.United will play hosts to Dick Campbell#s Arbroath, in an all-Championship clash on the weekend of September  .mdash Dundee United FCAugust , Dundee, meanwhile, will welcome League Two side Elgin City to Dens Park, also over the same weekend.The exact dates of the fixtures will be decided by SPFL bosses due to both sides being drawn to play at home.Tie is due to be played th th September #thedeemdash Dundee Football ClubAugust , "},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

score on the night meant the tie ended - on aggregate to the Croatians.However,Derek McInnes# side let themselves down with mistakes in the first leg, it was nothing compared to the excruciating early errors they made in the Granite City.By half-time, a goal from Stjepan Loncar # after Sam Cosgrove and Scott McKenna had collided in the visitors# area, Funso Ojo#s ridiculous dismissal and Antonio Colak#s second had sealed the deal for Rijeka.It had all started with such optimism.More than an hour before kick-off at Pittodrie, the cat was out of the bag star striker Cosgrove # supposedly laid low with a #hamstring injury# and having missed the Premiership loss to St Mirren  # was in the starting line-up.Niall McGinn, Jon Gallagher and Shay Logan also came back in after Curtis Main, Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and Zak Vyner had started in Paisley.Despite this boost, it was Rijeka who threatened first, the rapid winger Maxwell Acosty tearing past three red shirts before being stopped by Andy Considine on the edge of the area.On six minutes, Ojo was booked by referee Harald Lechner for his challenge on Acosty.After weathering a storm in the opening minutes, it looked like the Dons were growing into the game. However, after Scott McKenna and Cosgrove collided at a corner, Rijeka broke, with Loncar producing a neat finish from a front post cross to score # and put Aberdeen - down on aggregate.From this position, McInnes# side needed four unanswered goals, but it was to get worse.The Dons dire situation was reflected on  minutes when Ojo, under no pressure, sent a short pass from the centre-circle to Logan straight out of play.A minute later, he received his marching orders for a rash challenge on Luka Capan  yards from the Reds# goal # his fth yellow in sixth games catastrophic for the home team.Joe Lewis was also booked for his protestations.Then, on  minutes, Cosgrove was also given a yellow card, as the Dons let their emotions get the better of them and teetered on the edge of implosion.Rijeka#s second came on  minutes. Acosty was quick on the break again and, despite Jon Gallagher racing to catch him, the ball broke to visiting skipper Zoran Kvrzic, and his cross was nodded in at the back post by Colak.With the tie gone, McInnes opted to shore up his midfield at this point, hooking winger Niall McGinn for Dean Campbell # who slotted into the hole Ojo had left in midfield.Aberdeen were to round off the worst half they could#ve imagined with a shot on target, with Ryan Hedges# sweetly struck low volley from two yards forcing Andrej Prskalo to scramble to save at his far post.After the break, Gallagher briefly looked like scoring when he intercepted Ivan Lepinjica#s ball across the back, but despite him turning on the afterburners to reach the box, he was eventually crowded out.Cosgrove was taken off on  minutes, with Main replacing him. The striker was a second sending off waiting to happen and could#ve feasibly already received a another booking for a few late challenges.James Wilson, a forgotten man so far this term after signing permanently at the end of his Manchester United deal, was then thrown on for Hedges.However, there was little chance of even a consolation goal and the Dons# European campaign ended in misery # and the feeling they#d let themselves down # once more.TEAMS:Aberdeen: Lewis, Logan, Leigh, Considine, McKenna, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove, Ferguson, Gallagher, Ojo.Subs: Campbell , Main , Wilson Subs not used: Cerny, Devlin, Wilson, McLennan, Vyner.Rijeka: Prskalo, Puncec, Lepinjica, Kvrzic, Halilovic, Zuparic, Acosty, Colak, Raspopovic, Capan, Loncar.Subs: Muric , Vuk , Iglesias Subs not used: Pandur, Velkoski, Escoval, Smolcic.Referee: Harald Lechner.Attendance: , "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44679391-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44679391-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44679391-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44679391-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"cosgrove starts for aberdeen in crunch euro tie against rijeka","story":"Sam Cosgrove will start tonight#s Europa League third qualying round second leg against Rijeka at Pittodrie after overcoming a hamstring injury.The big striker has provided a welcome boost to boss Derek McInnes, with the Dons - down from the first leg in Croatia.Shay Logan also comes back in for Aberdeen at right-back.Here#s the team:mdash Aberdeen FCAugust , "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace. For the imprints you leave, have changed the fabric of time and space.If there is any justice in the supersonic space-age future, Electron Masss four EPs will hopefully have changed the fabric of

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many more could get this help – whether through financial charities or commercial organisations.Richard Gardiner,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter thanks","story":"I#m pleased to report the day raised £ for

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years.

McDonnells Edinburgh Declaration caught the Scottish political world completely by surprise. The SNP couldnt believe their ears. I initially thought his remarks, especially the reference to ldquothe English Parliament, were just a badly-briefed UK politician talking off the cuff. But no. It is now apparently UK Labour policy to accept the SNPrsquos call for ldquoindyref. Gobs were well and truly smacked.Most smacked of all were the Scottish Labour Partys. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda.

Lately, the complaints list has been extended to cover other tourist attractions. The North Coast  has become a haven for boyracers the Fairy Pools on Skye are more like Buchanan Galleries on a Saturday. The negative effects of ldquoover-tourism are being felt not just in Scotland. We have seen the snaking queue to get to the summit of Everest, the Venice river boat crushed by a cruise liner, the packed vans of camera-wielding tourists descending on wildle. Too many people wanting to do the same thing at the same time.There is a lot of it about, and not just at tourist hotspots. Of course the boom in tourism has brought benefits. Jobs have been created, wealth shared, communities kept in existence which might otherwise have disappeared. There is much to be said for laying out the welcome mat, for resisting the temptation to say ldquoEnjoy yourself, just not in my back yard.Ah, the dreaded Nimbyism, a shorthand for selfishness, for exclusivity, for shutting the door in other peoplersquos faces. It is behaviour often associated with Englandrsquos green belt, but it has spread much wider. Far from always being a bad thing it can, in certain cases and places, be a force for good.There is a theory about human behaviour which holds that given a choice, most people want to do the right thing. We give, we take, on the understanding that it works out for the best that way. The story of the modern world is of a species, humankind, grabbing too much and ing too little. At the risk of sounding like a Caledonian Gwyneth Paltrow, we have lost that sense of balance which kept things on an even keel. On a global scale we are paying for this in a planet that is cooking itself alive. On a smaller level, the failure to heed what is going on in our own backyards, to plan long term, is making le more dficult than it has to be.To take an example close to home, a couple of years ago a study by the National Centre for Social Research named East Dunbartonshire as the best place for a woman to live in Britain . Presenter Jane Garvey was despatched to report from the front line of Bishopbriggs.I wrote about the study at the time, saying East Dunbartonshire was indeed a terric place to live, we were very lucky to do so at a time when too many other parts of the city were blighted by poverty, but that signs of strain were beginning to show. This was before two large housing developments appeared, one so big it looks like a small village.No problem with that, one might think. Plenty of space to go around. But the roads surrounding the new developments are the same. Always busy before, the tailbacks now, particularly with the cycle lanes, make getting anywhere a trial. No problem, either, with the large retail developments setting up shop in the area. Except they offer free parking while the council charges to park close to the town centre. Result: the smaller shops in the village are struggling to survive.Another consequence of the developments is increased demand for water, locally and throughout the city. Scottish Water is having to lay a new pipeline from the reservoir at Milngavie, which involves the closure of a local car park. Again, donrsquot sweat the small stuff you might think.Preserving a balance is easy for nature but, it seems, increasingly dficult for humans. It is not a hard concept to grasp. At its most basic, it is about leaving a place in the same,not better, condition than you find it. It is finding another place to go, or not going at all.If you are Greta Thunberg it is sailing to New York for a summit on climate change rather than taking a plane. For some reason, the -year old Swede gets right up the noses of a certain sort, usually the middle aged and grumpy. Her scowling can be a trial ndash we have plenty of our own teenagers to provide that service ndash but she is right in what she says and does. To give the planet a chance we have to give things a miss, big and small. Stop behaving like we own the place in perpetuity. Consider those coming along after us.

This is just corporate welfare for the greedy train companies on an industrial scale.ldquoWith the colossal sums bled out of our railways by private companies, including the pound. billion ripped-off by the rolling stock outfits as exposed by RMT, it is crystal clear that ato public ownership would free up the funds needed to both hold down fares and invest in services.:Disruptionas flood-hit West Highland Line wont re-open for two weeks\"The private rail racket has left Britainrsquos passengers paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped out and unreliable services.

Even dreams.And is this not the most protecting, enveloping, egalitarian, comforting item of tailoring ever created Yoursquore worried now. You are imagining a slightly taller Jimmy Krankie tapping at a keyboard . But donrsquot be. The romance of the school blazer has little to do with appreciation of half of a legendary comic duo. Itrsquos more an argument for a clothing item which represents both a social and psychological imperative.This is back to school week and its arrival has seen a new blazer debate blazing, fuelled by Labour MP Emma Hardy who argues against the school trade arrangements which mean parents are essentially forced to buy brand names via sole suppliers. Shersquos right on the money with this argument.However, the debate has widened to whether or not the blazer should be binned entirely. The school bells of alarm have been clanged loudly by parentsrsquo group Connect who point out it costs an average of pound to send a unormed child to school. Thatrsquos a lot of money to come up with, particularlyyour brood is plentul. And itrsquos a tragedy in modern society when overburdened families have to gocap in hand for the pound grant Scotlandrsquos authorities offer.Yet, contrasting stats suggest it costs more to outfit kids in regular clothing, which is unlikely to be worn five days a week. Blazers donrsquot end up in a landfill sites after three wearings.There are more reasons why the blazer should be heralded. Psychologist Erik Eriksonrsquos theory of psychosocial development describes adolescence as a period in which teens grapple with questions concerning identity formation. They become preoccupied with how they appear to others.The blazer, it could be argued, helps mitigate this preoccupation. It allows for a neutrality of positioning, offering the caterpillar the chance to become the butterfly at their own speed. Itrsquos also a cloak of invisibility, allowing the -year-old boy to fancy whoever they like without fear of being noticed. And given the fact the blazer is gender neutralit allows the teenage girl to gradually find their own presentational form, denying the peer group pressure to premature sexualisation.Isnrsquot there a better form of non-identity than the collective school identity created by the blazer, the clothing form of the train station  you wait at while choosing the direction you may wish to go in  And given ours is currently a world of great isions, of gender politics, of nationalism, of battling Brextiteers and Europeanists, the unormity of unorm focuses the mind on school work, offering the  to learn how to make informed choices on the above.We need to remember young people crave the chance to remain young, until they cease to crave it any longer. So letrsquos endorse the snow-rain-wind-fashion fad, age-defiant blazer. Letrsquos celebrate this ubiquitous, resilient, quick-sponge-and-yoursquore-sorted school jacket. And tell me another item of clothingwhich tempts its wearer to sleep five minutes after sitting down in a cold school bus in winter.There are other anti-blazer arguments of course. The blazer is an identier, which at one time made it hard to skip school and into the Regal in Paisley with Pauline OrsquoDonnell.And the blazer isnrsquot the unorm of the natural rebel. Poet Carolyn Wright once declared that unormity, in its goals, its far-ranging consequences, is the natural enemy of poetry.But was she ever aware of how a maroon or a deep green blazer offered the young an immediate sense of community  Was CD Wright aware there was room for manoeuvre within the unorm the upturned blazer collar, the rakish tie, the slightly narrowed trouser width, the shortish skirt that almost commanded measurement More importantly, did the American ever consider the sheer poetry suggested by the schoolboy running at speed, successfully carrying in his double stitched Co-op blazer pocket a full bottle of American Cream Soda So letrsquos try and make the gender neutral, recyclable, discipline-inducing, comfort-offering blazer more affordable. It doesnrsquot have to cost the pound charged by some shops. .

While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

Back in the day, the Lansdowne Court Hotel was the place to go in Belfast. In the past year or so, the place had become a bit tired and it was put up for sale. I see it as a great opportunity to restore it to its glory days and bring something to the people of the Antrim Road and North Belfast.”Jim and his co-owners have put a lot of money into the refurbishment and he is very pleased the way the stunning new premises have turned out.“It is the city centre on the Antrim Road,” he added. “Everything is top class from the drink, food, garden and bridal suite. We have invested heavily and also boast around  staff so it is great to bring jobs to the local community.“When we bought it last March, we thought it was going to be a quick refurb and it would be opened for Christmas but the further we looked at it, it wasn’t going to be a quick turnaround.“We wanted to do things right and we are very pleased with the way it has turned out.”Jim is hoping the eye-catching new surroundings and features of the Landsdowne will bring people through the door – and he hopes to bring his expertise to the project.“Our support from the local community to date has been second to none since we opened seven weeks ago.“Customers have been very welcoming to me and I want to welcome them too.“I am here every day as the face on the floor. My background is in s and food so I hope to bring a fair bit to the table knowledge-wise.“For anyone who hasn’t been yet, come and try us – you will not be disappointed!“We are open to suggestions for anything that can be improved.“The bridal suite is stunning. It is the only room that hasn’t been used yet but there are a number of weddings booked for later in the year.“The garden has been there over  years.“We have invested a bit of money in it for people to sit and relax, enjoy a bit of food and drink.“We also put a lot of thought into the food. It is served both in the restaurant and bar. The small plates are proving a huge hit with customers.“We think our food is top end and we are not charging top end prices.”“It is a pleasure to be here. I am really excited about the Lansdowne,” he added.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim RoadBelfast BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pat gets ready for his latest big adventure","story":"ONE of the big hitmakers of the s pop scene, West Belfast’s very own The Adventures, will bring their back catalogue of melodic classics to the Devenish Complex as part of the Andersonstown News ‘Greatest Hits’ gala showcase.

I played guitar with Brian and haven’t seen him since his illness and now that he is cancer free, it will be good to see him.”On composing one of the most iconic songs of the s, Broken Land, Pat explained how he had been “messing about” on producer Garry Bell’s keyboards. “I got my daughter to school that Monday morning and the main part of the song was done that day,” he said.Still heavily rotated on airwaves  plus years later, Pat said there are lots of songs written that could appear on a new Adventures album. “I think we are playing better now than back in the day, I don’t know why, maybe we are all more experienced. I’d like to put a new album out and give the people that come to see, that are coming to see us, that new work, new material to sing along to.”Pat spoke of how the band are already looking to  with a series of gigs already lined up. “I have a lot of material and it’s a matter of putting it all down and getting it out there.

The DUP leadership needs to tackle the disrespect of their elected representatives and to belatedly show some modicum of political leadership.\"On Tuesday Apprentice Boys governor Graeme Stenhouse said the loyal order had \"no prior knowledge of the bands unorm, or this incident, until the conclusion of the main parade on Bond Street\".He added that \"we recognise this may have caused upset to many in the nationalist community\".But that has sparked a backlash by some bands.Cloughfern Young Conquerors Flute Band stated on Facebook: \"Today, from chairman down to the most junior members, we have made the decision to terminate all contracts with the ABOD and cease all communication with the association.\"We stand in solidarity with our friends in the Rathcoole Protestant Boys Flute Band and will set a hopeful trend that support for the organisation in the area stops.\"Rathcoole Protestant Boys described the Apprentice Boys statement as \"a complete joke\".\"We as a band have decided that after their statement that we will NOT do another ABOD parade again,\" they said.\"We stand with Clyde Valley, We dont turn our back on our own.\"Pride of Ballybeen also said it would not attend future Apprentice Boys demonstrations after members were left in \"disbelief\" at the loyal orders statement.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann called for talks to resolve the issue.\"It has worked before and it can work again, away from the heated public debate,\" he said.\"There is a conversation to be had around respecting each other and victims of the Troubles. Nobody should deliberately go out to antagonise innocent victims and their families. Unfortunately, Sinn Fein seem desperate to use this exercise to point score against political unionism. \"They demonstrate a shocking lack of self-awareness given the behaviour of some of their own elected representatives.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"The statement from the Apprentice Boys of Derry is helpful and in the spirit of accommodation. \"Hopefully it signals a corner has been turned on this issue.\"Nevertheless, it would be helpfulthe leadership of the DUP and UUP also acknowledged the wearing of a Parachute Regiment emblem in the specic context of Derry-Londonderry is irresponsible and provocative, rather than just creating a smokescreen.\" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also welcomed the statement from the Apprentice Boys. The Foyle MLA said: \"The statement from the Apprentice Boys acknowledging the genuine hurt caused by a band parading with Parachute Regiment and Soldier F insignia is a positive step that will contribute to healing in the city.\"It is welcome and demonstrates the kind of leadership that Derry and the North needs right now.\"However, TUV leader Jim Allister said: \"Fundamentally the issue which all the loyal orders need to reflect upon is this -a small Parachute Regiment symbol results in this aggressive reaction, whats next  \"Will it be RUC and UDR insignia \""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38406657.ece/9c65d/BINARY/BT_K6474.jpg","title":"in pictures girls outperform boys at alevel as amount of top grades increases","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free. The field is open Monday to Saturday, am-pm and Sunday, am-pm."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no silver-bullet solution to this issue but we are committed to ensuring that we are using every lever available to us to ease the pressure on businesses and consumers.”The minster said she has asked the CCPC to complete the study as a matter of priority.The Alliance for Insurance Reform welcomed the news.Peter Boland, director of the Alliance, said: “Our members have struggled to understand how their liability premiums have rocketed in the last five years while there has been no corresponding increase in either claims or awards.“We would welcome any additional transparency that might give an insight into why this happened.“Further we urge the government to move much quicker to publish other long-promised transparency measures on liability insurance like the National Claims Information Database and the Key Information Report on Employer and Public Liability Insurance Claims due at the end of last year.“Equally, we would urge the CCPC,they are progressing this investigation, to include employer liability and well as public liability.”Eoin McCambridge, managing director of McCambridges of Galway and director of the Alliance, said: “While we welcome this news, we urge government and all other interested parties not to get distracted from more immediate reforms.“Hard-pressed SMEs and voluntary organisations cannot wait for the years it will take for this investigation to be completed and have an impact.“Ireland stands virtually unique in the scale of general damages we hand out for minor injuries.“This has had a long-term negative impact on our insurance market and reform of the book of quantum by the promised Judicial Council must happen as a matter of urgency.“We urgeMinisterFlanagan to establish the Judicial Council immediately and not allow vested commercial interests to deflect from the progress or work of the council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"lib dems offer talks after criticism of jeremy corbyns unity government plan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It actually presents a very clear choice.“You either have Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister overturning the result of the referendum or Boris Johnson respecting the referendum, putting more money into the NHS, more police on the streets to keep us all safe.”As the dferent Remain factions split over the issue, Mr Johnson used Twitter to repeat his Brexit plan.He wrote: “The referendum result must be respected. We will leave the EU on st October.”Conservative former ministers Dominic Grieve and Sir Oliver Letwin were among those to be contacted by Mr Corbyn.Ive written to the leaders of other political parties and senior backbenchers from across Parliament to lay out my plan to stop a disastrous No Deal Brexit and let the people decide the future of our country. pic JzMjXCrqk— Jeremy CorbynAugust , Mr Grieve said a national unity government led by Mr Corbyn is a “most unlikely way forward”, noting the Labour leader has views which are “entirely abhorrent” to him.He said he was happy to speak to Mr Corbyn about ways in which they might “co-operate” to stop a no-deal Brexit, adding to the BBC: “Even for a short period a prime minister in a caretaker capacity has got to be somebody who can inspire trust – and such people do exist within the House of Commons and would be in a position to do that.“I have to say that seeing Jeremy Corbyn’s history, it’s dficult to see how he could possibly be in a position to do such a thing.”Parliament must legislate to stop no-deal.

Ms Tlaib’s family immigrated to the United States from the West Bank.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said that based on the congresswomen’s itinerary for their upcoming visit to the West Bank and Jerusalem, “it became clear that they are planning a trip whose sole purpose was strengthening the boycott and negating the legitimacy of Israel”.He said Israel has welcomed  Republican and Democratic members of Congress “with open arms”, and that “there’s not a state in the world that respects the United States and the US Congress more than the state of Israel”.It is an affront that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, under pressure from President Trump, would deny entry to representatives of the U.S. government.My full statement: pic vESmehXT— Rep.

Critics say the movement aims to legitimise Israel and ultimately erase it from the map, replacing it with a binational state.Ms Tlaib and Ms Omar have also been the target of repeated attacks by Mr Trump in recent months, including a series of racist tweets on July  in which he said they should “go back” to the “broken” countries they came from.Both are US citizens and Ms Tlaib was born in America.The two women are members of the so-called “Squad” of newly-elected left-wing Democrats, along with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.House speaker Nancy Pelosi, long a supporter of Israel, criticised the decision and Mr Trump’s statements, saying they are “beneath the dignity of the Office of the President”."},{"url":null,"title":"nasas top official gets look at next moon rocket","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After he trained as an architect and engineer, he was apprenticed to the Derry building firm of George and Robert A. Ferguson. He later set up his own practice in the city and at a young age was responsible for large projects in Omagh, Coleraine and other towns.Amongst the projects he oversaw in his native city were the Corporation waterworks at Creggan and was he was also associated to the layout of Foyle College grounds for building purposes. But amongst Barkers main projects was designing a shirt factory for David Hogg and Charles Mitchell at Sackville Street in Derry. He had also been heavily involved in the project to build the new Presbyterian |Church at Burt, Co Donegal in the mid-s.Constructed in , Hogg  Mitchell’s shirt factory almost immediately won a highly lucrative contract when it became the supplier of shirts for the British Army during the Boer War . The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in .Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , .He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city.While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War.Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria.The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century.The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour.Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia.Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion.On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation.The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki.On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs.A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man.The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft.

These included , Koreans and  Japanese soldiers.Industrial damage at Nagasaki was high and left between -% of industrial production destroyed. The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage.In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air.“Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation.“We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.”Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war.Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique.Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since .In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki.“After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends!“Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.”The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death.The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until .In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. When he passed away in , aged  Rev Dr Thomas McCurdy Barker was buried at Castlerock in Co Derry.His father William, mother Mary who died in  and his brother, also a Presbyterian minister, Rev William Alexander Barker who passed away in  are buried in Derry City Cemetery.CAPTION: The mushroom cloud over the Japanese city of Nagasaki after the USA detonated an atomic bomb there on August , . "},{"url":null,"title":"derry search operation linked dissident republican activity","story":"The PSNI has said that search operation at a building site in Derry was part of an investigation into dissident republican activity.Detectives from the Terrorism Investigation Unit carried out the search at the former Nazareth House residential home in the Bishop Street area.Police cordoned off the district at the Sunbeam Terrace area in lower Bishop Street which includes a local primary school and Lumen Christi grammar school where students today collected examination results.

Her comments were backed by UUP leader Robin Swann.Yesterday, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MLA said there is a palpabale sense of anger across the city that has to be addressed and the Apprentice Boys bear a lot of the responsibility in addressing it.Fty years on from the Battle of the Bogside when the nationalist people of Derry stood up for their rights, Mr Eastwood was askedthe actions over the weekend showed there is real leadership and respect between both communities.He said: \"The way the DUP have handled the situation is disgraceful and they have avoided showing any kind of leadership. Some people in the DUP have deliberately rubbed salt in the wounds and its time for them to wise up.\"We have to move beyond this where were constantly poking people in the eye about issues that happened many years ago.\"We have to move forward together, the Apprentice Boys, the community, the business sector and politicians were part of the solution when it came to marching it Derry and they have to be again. But it has to be on the basis of respect for people who live in the city.\"People cant be disrespected, especially the feelings of the Bloody Sunday families, like they were last week.\"There has always been an understanding that the Apprentice Boys marches would be accommodated but that there would be respect shown to the local community. They should be about the events theyre commemorating not about peoples political causes in the march.\"That could start with ensuring that that band never takes part in a march in Derry again.\"The march will have to be accommodated in future, he said, \"however dficult that is for people in the city becausewe want to create a new Ireland we cant do it by denying people the opportunity to march.\"We done it in much more dficult times, so we have to do it again, but its a two way street andwe want to have a shared city respect has to be shown by everyone.\"He welcomed a statement from the Apprentice Boys acknowledging the hurt caused, saying, it demonstrates \"the kind of leadership that Derry and the North needs right now\".GoadingSinn Féin Vice-President Michelle ONeill has also called on the leadership of the main unionist parties to condemn the \"deliberate goading of victims\" which took place last weekend.Michelle O’Neill said: “The inclusion of Soldier F and British Army Paratrooper emblems have been seen in Derry as a deliberate attempt to goad and antagonise the Bloody Sunday families.“The decision of senior DUP representatives wearing Apprentice Boys regalia to pose for photographs under a Paratrooper regiment banner is seen in exactly the same light.“However, instead of confronting this mocking of victims, both main unionist parties have sought to deflect and criticise the policing operation instead.“Once again that is an abdication of leadership from the DUP and the UUP. Instead of defending disrespect and pandering to the lowest common denominator they should come out and clearly condemn this deliberate goading of victims.”Prominent figure during the Battle of the Bogside, People Before Profit Councillor Eamonn McCann said DUP politicians standing under a Parachute Regiment banner meant people could reasonably draw the conlcusion that they were \"supporting murder in the Bogside\".Meanwhile the Alliance Party said the DUPs criticism of the police response risks fuelling flase notions of two-tier policing.Alliance Policing Board member John Blair MLA said: \"Accountability is vital to policing but politicians need to be careful not to cross over to undermining policing. The DUP and UUP need to acknowledge this one band were wrong to parade with Parachute Regiment insignia in Derry-Londonderry, given the context and legacy of Bloody Sunday.“Such politically opportunistic actions are not helpful to policing across the community, particularly given other recent events. Politicians should know better than play to the gallery at times when sensitivities are to the fore.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"last chance vote derry projects","story":"Local charity Kinship Care NI and the team behind the restoration of Derry’s Brooke Park are urging people to support them as the voting period of the th Birthday National Lottery Awards comes to an end.Brooke Parkis competing to for the title of the National Lottery’s Best Heritage Project while Kinship Care is in the running for the Best Community and Charity Award.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -.

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10256932.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the struggle for freedom you have given your best. There’s Hughes and there’s Bateson, Sheridan  Lee and inscribed with their names now brave Tom McElwee.”Mr Bateson’s comments have sparked anger from unionists, with UUP leader Robin Swann calling for him to resign “before he causes any more offence”.Ballymena TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston said: “Thomas McElwee was no hero. There was nothing brave or heroic about the actions which resulted in McElwee being in the Maze in the first place.“I think there was a great deal more gallantry displayed by his victim, Yvonne Dunlop.“Mrs Dunlop was a -year-old married mother-of-three who died when the IRA firebombed Alley Katz boutique in Bridge Street. “Her nine-year-old son was able to escape the building because she shouted a warning after checking a shopping bag left by two girls and discovered a bomb. Sadly Yvonne Dunlop did not have a chance to get away before the firebomb exploded.”Mr Gaston added: “The rewriting of history while those who bravely faced down terror are subject to prosecution is causing huge anger within the unionist community. Republicans demand respect while trampling over the victims of their bloody IRA.”The News Letter attempted to contact Mr Bateson but without success.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns hot-dogs Upcoming events in conjunction with Local Authorities are:Shambles Market, Armagh, on August Peoples Park, Ballymena, on August Carnfunnock Park, Larne, on August Celebrating business excellence at awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Bangor on August , and,St Columb’s Park, Derry, on August .If you would like to attend one of the ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events, get in touch with Dogs Trust’s Campaigns team in Northern Ireland via email campaigns.ni@dogstrust.org.uk or by calling .try catch  TrendingMankilled in two vehicle road traffic collision -

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During the Second World War the building was used as an auxiliary workshop. It changed hands in the early s to become Moorwell Motors.Ben Wells, managing director at Project Three, said: ldquoWe are delighted to reveal our plans to restore and revitalise this impressive Penarth building.ldquoWe were immediately struck by the strong architectural style of the faccedilade and the light and space inside. It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.

We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster business top  launch ","story":"Posted on Wednesday  August  by Ulster Business Sarah Little, publishing director, INM NI, Mark Thompson, AL Goodbody with John Mulgrew The cream of Northern Ireland’s business community have gathered to mark the official launch of the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies , with AL Goodbody.
