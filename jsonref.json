He said this could happen even earlier, if the data allows. The legal requirement will be replaced with guidance that urges people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.Furthermore, free Covid lateral flow tests look set to be scrapped by July. People will instead be pointed towards an online ordering system to purchase the tests, which cost £30 for a pack of seven. The Department of Health said the changes come after a review of data last week including infections, vaccine efficacy, Covid pressures on the NHS, workforce absences, public behaviours, and views from the scientific community. Sajid Javid claimed the success of Britain’s vaccine rollout is ‘allowing us to cautiously return to plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country’.The Health Secretary insisted: ‘Our vaccines, testing and antivirals ensure we have some of the strongest defences in Europe and are allowing us to cautiously return to plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country. ‘As we learn to live with Covid, we need to be clear eyed that this virus is not going away so if you haven\u0027t already – please come forward for your first, second or booster jab.’ It comes as the Prime Minister awaits Miss Gray’s official report into multiple alleged parties in No10 and Whitehall during the pandemic.It is not clear what the report has discovered but an indication of how damaging it could be for the Government came when Scotland Yard chief Dame Cressida Dick announced a police inquiry was being carried out, based in part on evidence obtained by the Gray investigation. There was speculation that after the report was not delivered yesterday, MPs and the public may have to wait until after the weekend for its publication, as Mr Johnson had promised to address the Commons shortly after it was released.There were suggestions that due to today being Holocaust Memorial Day and many MPs being back in their constituencies from Thursday afternoon, No10 may hold off on publishing the report once it was received.However, Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the conclusions would be important enough to bring to the House straight away.Earlier, during Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Johnson had misled Parliament about Downing Street parties, something which would normally require a minister to resign. Asked if he would quit, the Prime Minister said: ‘No.’Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson would not have to step aside even if he was interviewed by police in their probe.Speaking on Channel 4 News, Mr Rees-Mogg said ‘that wouldn\u0027t be a resigning matter, because people are innocent in this country until proved guilty’.But if the outcome of the Gray report is significantly damaging, Mr Johnson could face a revolt from his own MPs, who may choose to call a vote of no confidence.The Mail reported that Tories were urging the PM to scrap a planned hike in national insurance to win back their support.The Commons Treasury Committee has warned in a report released on Thursday that the rise in employer national insurance contributions would contribute to a rise in inflation.Conservative MP for Bolton North East Mark Logan said that while Mr Johnson had his support, there needed to be a reset.When the Gray report is published, sources close to the investigation team expect it to be published in full, although ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide.Downing Street said it is the ‘intention’ to publish the report in the format in which Mr Johnson receives it."},{"url":null,"title":"Carries friend Goldsmith says PM NOT involved efforts help airlift animal charity Kabul","story":"Share this article Peers today called for Goldsmith to appear before them and explain what happened over the controversial airlift.Labour former defence secretary Lord Browne of Ladyton said: \u0027Once again we\u0027re being treated to ministers in studios and in the House not facing up to the fact that the evidence is out there.

He described himself as ‘a lifelong friend’ of farming but was uncompromising on what the sector needs to do to reduce emissions. Photograph: Alan Betson Taoiseach Micheál Martin has told the Irish Farmers’ Association that climate change cannot be wished away and denied any suggestion that farmers have been a “soft target” for greenhouse gas emissions reductions. At the annual general meeting of the IFA in Dublin, Mr Martin described himself as “a lifelong friend” of farming but was nonetheless uncompromising on what the sector needs to do to reduce emissions. In response to comments by delegates that farmers were being singled out or scapegoated and the Government would apply “blunt instruments” to achieve the targets, the Taoiseach responded that agriculture would not by a long shot be the only sector to make sacrifices, and that transport would be under enormous pressure. “We are a country that is coming from behind to be honest. We have done the talk on climate change but the milestones of achievement are not as impressive as the talk is,” he argued. “Farming is not a soft target. You are not a soft target,” he told the meeting at the Mansion House in Dublin. In his address, Mr Martin said climate change was a threat to all of us and to our way of life.“We are at a crossroads for Irish farming and for forestry. Threats and opportunities abound but our choice now is to either honestly address the challenge that climate change poses for the sector, and together harness the opportunities that this changing context presents. Or, as some voices counsel, to resist what I see is quickly becoming irresistible.” He told the meeting that farmers were citizens with families, members of the community and had a vested interest in safeguarding the future of the State. “Farmers know their land better than anyone and are well placed to lead in meeting our climate ambitions,” he said. He said the challenge was to reduce the use of chemical nitrogen while maintaining our position as global leader in grass growth through multi-species swards.He warned that more would inevitably be asked of the sector if these measures alone proved insufficient to meet the emissions reductions that were required.IFA president Tim Cullinan was one of several speakers who argued that the lower end of the suggested scale of reductions (a 22 per cent cut in emissions) was as much as could be achieved. He said farmers accepted the climate emergency but the actions proposed risked creating a global food emergency, especially with population figures increasing.“Farmers are constantly lectured on sustainability. But sustainability has three pillars – environmental, social and economic,” he said. “We will not shirk our responsibilities, but we won’t allow our members to be thrown to the wolves.“I want to warn against imposing solutions without reaching agreement with farmers. Using a blunt instrument to satisfy the Green Party would be a huge mistake.“We live in a democracy. A party with 12 seats out of 160 cannot rule the roost.”Mr Cullinan also criticised the delay in creating an office of a food regulator or food ombudsman, something which had been promised by Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue. “This week, our poultry farmers were protesting outside Lidl who decided to sell a large chicken for €3.49. They did this knowing that poultry growers are on their knees.Mr Cullinan said farmers would not not be “bullied or intimidated by legal or other threats. And we won’t stand by while retailers make dirt of our food.”In his address, Mr McConalogue said that in the context of the climate change debate Irish agriculture was unique in terms of its central place in the economy and the science around the sector. All of the Government representatives identified the forestry sector as posting large challenges, with the prospect of little new afforestation occurring over the next number of years.Mr McConalogue and the Minister for State with responsibility for afforestation, Pippa Hackett, said a Bill had been introduced to allow small scale planting on farms without a need for licences. Ms Hackett said the backlog in licensing appeals had been reduced from 1,000 to about 20, and also said the issue around supply shortages to wood mills had also been all but resolved. “We have made the licensing process simpler,” said Mr McConalogue. “We have to get our planting rates up, and forestry is a viable ersification option that can co-exist with other farm enterprises. We know that we have to improve our processes in the department, but we also need to work together,” he added.

Video: Oireachtas TVSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: Playing the man not the ball? Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireDing-Dong! Mary Lou on high (horse).Maybe a bit late for a Christmas carol, but old scores were all the rage in the Dáil on Wednesday, where rage was also all the rage.But before we get to that, how about some good news?For in the midst of vicious exchanges on the housing crisis between the Taoiseach and the leader of Sinn Féin, there came confirmation from a gilded bunker in Baggot Street which gladdened hearts all across the land.Robert Watt, the Generous Salary, sorry, general secretary of the Department of Health, is now happily restored to optimum pay (nearly €295,000).This emerged in a one-line statement from his department: “The secretary general has confirmed that he is in receipt of the full salary for his role.”Having previously waived the €81,000 pay rise he was due upon moving from the Department of Public Expenditure to his current berth, the civil servant recently refused to tell the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee if this was still the case. Pointed remarks about transparency from two senior Government Ministers this week may have forced a change of heart.Because after a couple of gentle whacks from Darragh O’Brien and Heather Humphreys, The Generous Salary revealed he is now accepting his full whack.Word came through around midday, after a Labour Party motion on spiralling inflation and the soaring cost of living had given way to a rancorous clash on affordable rents.It lifted the spirits of our post-pandemic inflation nation.Shouting matchThe news sustained us through the bitter row over housing during Leaders’ Questions and helped us recover from an angry shouting match between Michael Healy-Rae and the Labour Party which took place just before.There is always an edge to the exchanges between Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald, with the Taoiseach constantly annoyed by the Sinn Féin leader’s attempts to box him off as a supporter and enabler of billionaire property developers while he tries to explain what his Government is doing to tackle the crisis he repeatedly calls “the single most important issue facing our country at this moment in time”.Mary Lou has the justifiable anger and frustration of shut-out buyers and stressed-out renters on her side. She has an arsenal of harrowing anecdotes to draw upon. She has Eoin Ó Broin to throw his book at him. She has the entire dysfunctional mess of the property market for ammunition.Go fix it, she tells the Taoiseach. Fix it now. Do something. Do something now.He outlines the projects and schemes under way. He talks about the biggest house-building programme in the history of the State. Record “commencements”. Billions being spent. Construction bouncing back. “The momentum, as it were, is in the pipeline.”But it needs time and “a whole-of-government approach” and cross-party buy-in.Mary Lou McDonald gets to her feet.“So, you failed,” she tells him. “Let me help you, Taoiseach, to try and absorb the reality.” She holds up a photocopied page showing an advert for a flat to rent. Mad money. “So, this is a storage room . . .” she begins, before producing two more pages of equally dismal places for rent.Converted hallwayOne in Cork where “you could touch your fridge if you stretch your feet out of your bed” and a converted hallway in Dublin going for €910 a month.“That’s probably a snip, in your mind.”But she wasn’t finished with him yet.She had shown him the reality for Generation Rent. “Don’t you dare talk to me about false narratives or claim that you understand the crisis. You clearly don’t. While you’re there scratching your head I’ve told you two things you can do that will work . . .”If he does them, people might believe “that you finally get it”.Sinn Féin TDs cheered their leader as she resumed her seat.The Taoiseach rose, clearly annoyed by the personal nature of the attack. So he took the personal route too, stung by her parting shot that he doesn’t “get it”.“You paint a narrative in terms of me” – he pointed to himself – “as being orced from reality and all of that.”Across the floor the TDs couldn’t resist. “You are! You are!” they chorused.He put up a hand to silence them. “Okay. I just want to say to you, deputy, my background and where I grew up and what we had to put up with is far different to yours.”The Taoiseach was leaning forward, directly addressing his opposite number. He didn’t raise his voice but his anger was evident in those clipped, level tones.A few dissenting voices rose up. Again, his hand went up to quell them. He wanted to make his point, which he did, eyes still locked on his political rival.“Don’t you dare lecture me,” he said slowly. “Okay?”Bus driverThere was a sense of an old score being settled here by a man frustrated and totally fed up by the constant inferences that he is a heartless member of some detached, moneyed elite. Micheál Martin, the son of a bus driver from Cork city, who believes he incorporates the decent values of old Fianna Fáil, had had enough.“I understand the realities of life as well as anybody in this House. And I don’t pretend to understand it more,” he said as the heckling grew in intensity and the back-and-forth became more and more bitter, Eoin Ó Broin and Pearse Doherty joining Mary Lou in the fray.Still angry, the Taoiseach accused Sinn Féin of talking from both sides of its mouth and exploiting the crisis for political gain.“This crisis is too big for politics,” he said.Mary Lou McDonald shot over a pitiful eye, batting his words away with a dismissive hand as if speaking to a difficult child.“Stop that. Stop that. Stop that,” she repeated. “Stop now.”“Deputy, you are not the leader. You were not appointed by the Politburo,” snarled Micheál.“So just BACK OFF!”The Taoiseach’s unusual reaction was understandable – there is a definite element of playing the man and not the ball to Mary Lou’s approach, but when the Ceann Comhairle called time, one suspects Sinn Féin will have been far more satisfied with their afternoon’s work.Earlier in the day, it was Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae who took the chance to settle an old score. Last year, after lambasting the Labour Party for its lack of affinity with the plain people of Ireland, the Kerry businessman was badly roughed up by the party’s new deputy for Fingal, Duncan Smith.“I’m not going to be lectured on understanding workers. I do not have to put on a political costume and a caricature to pretend I am working class, like some,” Smith told the Healy-Rae brothers during his excoriating contribution.Cost of livingSo, when Labour brought forward a motion on the rising cost of living, Michael saw his chance to get one back for the team.“The people who are moving the motion are the people who wanted to put a water tax on everybody in this country and said they’d turn off the water if they did not pay the tax. These are the people who did away with the death grant you attacked every woman in this country you did away with their pensions you hurt them beyond belief.”A noisy shouting match ensued between MHR and the Labour duo of Brendan Howlin and Jed Nash.Michael repeatedly asked Howlin to shut up. He said Howlin and his crowd are nothing like the “old Labour” they once had in Kerry, people like Breeda Moynihan-Cronin and the Spring family. There were “good people”.This has the makings of an excellent feud."},{"url":null,"title":"national broadband ireland must take responsibility for delays","story":"National Broadband Ireland is the company set up to manage installing broadband access to 540,000 homes and businesses. It was awarded the State contract in 2019 after Eir and ESB-Vodafone joint venture Siro withdrew from the competition. Photograph: Rui VieiraPA WireSome of the delay with the rollout of broadband across the country is the fault of National Broadband Ireland (NBI), Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Ossian Smyth has said. Mr Smyth, who is the Minister of State with responsibility for communications, said while some delays had been caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the company had to “take responsibility”. NBI is the company set up to manage installing broadband access to 540,000 homes and businesses. It was awarded the State contract in 2019 after Eir and ESB-Vodafone joint venture Siro withdrew from the competition.“There has been an impact from Covid, it has slowed them down, it has taken a few months off, it has made them several months later than they should be but it’s not the entire story, part of the problem is their fault”, Mr Smyth told Fine Gael TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill during questions in the Dáil on Thursday.“Part of the problem is their fault because part of the delay comes from natural things that happen within a large rollout contract where there’s a period of time where you’re developing momentum, becoming more skilled and I would expect that at least a portion of the delays are the fault of NBI. “They may believe that it’s the fault of their subcontractors and they may try and attribute blame but that doesn’t excuse them, as they are not in a position to abdicate their responsibility. They have to take responsibility, even in a situation where they’ve delegated authority for some of their functions.”He said 2022 targets were under negotiation and he expected to have revised numbers within two weeks. Separately, the company on Thursday told the Oireachtas committee on transport and communications it would miss its revised end-of-January target to pass 60,000 homes and premises.Last year, NBI cut its end-of-January rollout target from 115,000 to 60,000, saying the project had been disrupted by Covid-19 restrictions.NBI chief executive Peter Hendrick told the committee that the 60,000 target would not now be met until the end of March.ContractMr Smyth told the Dáil he would publish as much of the National Broadband Plan contract as legally possible. “A large portion of the contract was published before I assumed office, and I have asked the department to review with the lawyers how much more of it they can publish within the law,” he said. The Mayo TD also said that he was concerned that there was still no sense of what connections will happen this year and “the Covid excuse has to finish now”. “Instead of getting so much spin and so much material, can we start to challenge NBI on what it is delivering on the ground,” he added. Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy said he was concerned about the “general attitude” being taken by the Government, “with the fact that the National Broadband Plan has missed every single target set for it up to this point”. “This is not acceptable, this contract is costing Irish taxpayers €3 billion. There should be no scope for failure, especially when one considers the price of failure for so many families, workers and communities waiting in anticipation of being connected to this network,” the Cavan-Monaghan TD said. Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said there was a need for transparency and information and asked for contract to be published.She said there also needed to be monthly figures published “to give us clarity on what exactly is being delivered”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"do hang toilet roll","story":"You can tell a lot about a person from the particulars of their downstairs loo. Celebrities’ loos especially. Lynn Barber, the so-called ‘demon barber of Fleet Street’, used to say that she made a point of visiting the loo when she interviewed a famous person, mainly so she could rifle through their medicine cabinet.Not that you need to be so invasive. In Lenny Kravitz’s downstairs loo, I found black toilet paper. In Jeffrey Archer’s, an original David Hockney. In a former Olympian’s, a naked sculpture of themselves and a large, unflushed faecal deposit. To each his own.But it turns out there’s an even easier way of judging people by their toilet habits: which way round you hang your loo roll. At this point I’ll bring in  reader Alan Belk of Leatherhead in Surrey, who joined an ongoing discussion in our letters pages about everyday markers of “commonness”.Mr Belk’s Yorkshire-born mother’s “single test” of people, he said, was “which way round a loo roll was positioned. If the hanging sheets were adjacent to the wall, they were ‘reet posh’ if they hung away from the wall, they were ‘reet common’.”The theory was that families who didn’t have a lot of money, like her own, had outside lavatories. “If the roll was placed with sheets adjacent to the wall, they would get damp due to condensation and sometimes freeze to the wall.” To do so, then, was a sign of privilege. And perhaps central heating.And so reopens one of the most enduring debates of the internet’s dodgy outer suburbs: over or under – what is the correct way to hang your loo roll?“Over. Obviously,” came the first response, when I threw the question out to the masses, which means my WhatsApp contacts. “Even for rich people, what is the benefit of under?” another asked. “Over. WTF?” a third spat back. Meanwhile, my girlfriend declared: “I don’t know that many people with toilet roll holders,” which frankly felt like she was reaching for a new front in the bathroom class wars. One for another day.They are out there, though, the unders, and living among us. Supposedly there are about 9 million of them, enough to mean the ision has its own Wikipedia section, and their reasons are either aesthetic or environmental (some reckon you use less paper if it is awkward to get to), or just habit. In 2021, a study – the word seems lofty for this topic, but that’s what they called it – conducted by bathroom design company Bathroom Origins found that half of us get annoyed when we see loo roll the “wrong” way, with people aged 45 to 54 most het up at the sight of it. Many cannot help but turn it around when they see it.Another survey, by Dr Gilda Carle, determined that people who leave the loose end furthest from the wall “like being in charge, like organisation and order, and are likely to overachieve.” The “unders”, meanwhile, “tend to be more relaxed, more dependable, and seek relationships with strong foundations.” Dr Carle, I suspect, is an “under”.That science might be questionable, but the hygiene element isn’t. As is frequently pointed out when this conversation roars back into life, hanging your loo roll in an “under” position means that a person’s unwashed hands will probably brush the wall as they grasp for the loose end, depositing whatever bacteria was on there for the next person to pick up. In the “over”, people touch only the paper they’ll use.But there is one more argument on the side of the “overs”, and it probably finishes it: the original patent for perforated toilet paper, filed by Seth Wheeler in the US in 1891, includes diagrams of loo rolls which are, quite clearly, in the over position. Common or not, that’s it settled for me. Over, and out.More from NewsWork from home tax loophole to be closed after it cost Treasury £500 millionRishi Sunak fighting hard to stop invoking Article 16, claim Boris Johnson’s alliesGPs told to resume face-to-face appointments as focus shifts from rollout of Covid booster vaccinesA toxic Tory civil war is brewing – and it threatens to leave the party in ruinsNHS officials took £70,000 drug company bribes, then ‘switched’ patients’ medication, court toldBoris Johnson urged to sack more No 10 staffers amid fears ‘partygate’ reset will not be enoughMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gps told resume face to face appointments focus shifts rollout","story":"GPs are being told to get back to offering face-to-face appointments, after official figures showed worsening access to family doctors.The statistics for December show just 61 per cent of GP consultations in England took place in person, down from 63 per cent the month before. This compares with 80 per cent before the pandemic.Health chiefs wrote to all GPs on Thursday, thanking them for their part in the rollout of booster jabs - but urging them to now “restore routine service”.It came as patient groups raised fears that struggles to see a GP had become “the new normal”, with too many elderly people expected to “jump through hoops” to see a doctor.In early December, GPs were told to prioritise the rollout of boosters above much of their standard care.Dr Nikki Kanani, medical director for primary care, wrote to all GPs on Thursday urging them to take speedy action to resume normal service.Thanking GPs for their part in the rollout, she said: “It is now important that all services across the NHS, including in primary care, are able to restore routine services where these were paused in line with the Prime Minister’s request to focus all available resource on the omicron national mission.”In the letter, Dr Kanani asked fellow GPs to take action to ensure good access for urgent cases, those with suspected cancer, and the backlog of those seeking care.Dennis Reed, from patient group Silver Voices, said: “It really worries me that we have ended up stuck in a new normal where people, especially the elderly, are ending up being asked to go through hoops to justify and explain why they need to see a GP.”“Too often we are seeing people giving up because of long waits, or difficulties getting the appointment they need, or ending up in A\u0026ampE, with problems only being treated when they are far more advanced”.The figures show that in total, 25 million people had appointments at GP surgeries in December, down from 30 million in November.The statistics from the NHS Digital suggest the number of boosters at GP practices remained steady, at about four million per month in November and December.Health officials said around two million more jabs were delivered at walk-in appointments by primary care networks in December, as part of a major drive in the run-up to Christmas. They said they were unable to supply figures for such slots in November, because of changes in recording systems.Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Today’s figures reveal once again the consistently high number of patient appointments GPs and our teams are managing to deliver under intense workload and workforce pressures, that have only been exacerbated by the pandemic.“In December alone, GPs made 25 million patient appointments - higher than in the same period pre-pandemic – and not taking account of the exceptional work done to deliver the Covid-19 booster campaign, protecting patients from the virus.”He said GPs were under “immense pressure” trying to manage ever-growing need for care and services, with too few doctors and other staff to cope with an ageing and growing population.Prof Marshall added: “The Government made a manifesto pledge of an additional 6,000 GPs by 2024 – plus 26,000 additional practice staff – and we urgently need to see progress so that we can safely deliver the care and services that our patients need, now and in the future.”More from NewsWork from home tax loophole to be closed after it cost Treasury £500 millionRishi Sunak fighting hard to stop invoking Article 16, claim Boris Johnson’s alliesA toxic Tory civil war is brewing – and it threatens to leave the party in ruinsNHS officials took £70,000 drug company bribes, then ‘switched’ patients’ medication, court toldBoris Johnson urged to sack more No 10 staffers amid fears ‘partygate’ reset will not be enoughOver half of women turn 30 without children, as later motherhood becomes the normMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"half women turn 30 without children later motherhood becomes","story":"More than half of women are childless by the age of 30, according to official figures which show later motherhood, or choosing not to have any children, has now become the norm.The statistics show that for the first time, the majority of women enter their 30s without having started a family.The Office for National Statistics data paint a stark picture of changes in fertility over the decades.It is the first time there have been more childless women than mothers below the age of 30 since records dating back to 1920 began.While 50.1 per cent of today’s 30-year-olds are childless, the most common age for those born in 1975 to give birth was 31 years. For the generation of baby boomers before that, born in 1949, the age was 22.Amanda Sharfman, an ONS statistician, said: “We continue to see a delay in childbearing, with women born in 1990 becoming the first cohort where half of the women remain childless by their 30th birthday.”She said the trends had been steadily rising for decades - and are likely to keep doing so.“Lower levels of fertility in those currently in their 20s indicate that this trend is likely to continue,” she said.Surveys have found that those planning a family often delay for years, as they seek to rise up the career ladder and buy their first home. Watchdogs have said clinics should be more honest about the chance of motherhood as fertility declines.Last year the new president of an all-female college at Cambridge University introduced fertility lessons to students, saying an emphasis on careers meant many women left it too late to have families, despite wanting them.Dorothy Byrne, the former head of Channel 4 News, who had a child aged 45, said the seminars were designed to help women understand the dramatic drop in fertility after the age of 35.Fertility experts have said schools should teach young girls about declining fertility, instead of focusing on messages about avoiding pregnancy.The ONS data also shows the average number of children a woman has had by the age of 30 has been dropping since 1971, when it stood at 1.89. Last year, it fell to 0.89, its lowest ever level, showing the drop off in family sizes for people in their 20s.Ms Sharfman said: “The average number of children born to a woman has been below two for women born since the late 1950s.“While two-child families are still the most common, women who have recently completed their childbearing are more likely than their mothers’ generation to have only one child or none at all.”Dr Jo Mountfield, a consultant obstetrician and the vice president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said it was vital that all young people were fully educated about fertility, so they could make informed decisions.She said: “Over the last few decades, there has been a general trend of women choosing to have babies later than women a generation ago, and a growing trend of women having fewer or no children. This is due to a range of social, professional and financial reasons.“Natural fertility starts to decline from around the age of 35 and while many women older than this have successful pregnancy outcomes, giving birth later in life is associated with an increased possibility of complications. These include potentially taking longer to get pregnant, fertility problems, increased risk of miscarriage and a more complicated labour.”More from NewsWork from home tax loophole to be closed after it cost Treasury £500 millionRishi Sunak fighting hard to stop invoking Article 16, claim Boris Johnson’s alliesGPs told to resume face-to-face appointments as focus shifts from rollout of Covid booster vaccinesA toxic Tory civil war is brewing – and it threatens to leave the party in ruinsNHS officials took £70,000 drug company bribes, then ‘switched’ patients’ medication, court toldBoris Johnson urged to sack more No 10 staffers amid fears ‘partygate’ reset will not be enoughMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeons trans policy turns blind eye rights women","story":"This week police officers in Gwent arrested a woman accused of putting up posters declaring that “humans never change sex” and warning “men in dresses” to stay out of women-only spaces. You can see why certain people of a particular political bent might see this behaviour as an opportunity to enrol the police in their campaign to silence critics of their own agenda. But whether Gwent police over-reached in their powers remains to be seen. What is extraordinary about the arrest of women’s rights campaigner Jennifer Swayne is that officers are also said to have seized an academic book about the trans issue from Swayne’s home. Transgender Children and Young People: Born In Your Own Body is edited by Dr Heather Brunskell-Evans and reportedly (I have not read it) asserts that politics rather than science accounts for the recent rise in the number of transgender children.I don’t envy the police in such situations. They have already fallen foul of their forces’ more enthusiastically woke officers seeking to intimidate citizens who dared to challenge trans orthodoxy what possible excuse can they have for seizing part of a suspect’s library, unless they genuinely believe the book itself is an illegal publication?Swayne’s arrest, however, was merely an appetiser for a more significant development this week. The Scottish Government, in a dreary and joyless competition with Jacinda Ardern and Justin Trudeau to see who can run the world’s most “progressive” administration, has committed to legislating to allow Scots to self-identify as any gender they wish. Obviously this is a controversial move, since being legally accepted as a woman when you were born male would no longer require any medical or psychological confirmation that you suffer from gender dysphoria. The move would also dispense with the requirement to live in your preferred gender for a minimum period of time.Claims by supporters of this move that the legal change would impact on no one other than those trans people concerned have been vociferously disputed by women’s groups who fear their rights to single sex spaces – including changing rooms, women’s sports, prisons and refuges – would be further weakened. So far ministers – including the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon – have dismissed such concerns. Sturgeon enjoys her role as a champion of LGBT rights, with particularly heavy emphasis on the “T”. And anyway, she is in the comfortable (though democratically dangerous) position of knowing that nothing she does in government will have the slightest impact on her party’s support in the polls.She is in a strong enough position, therefore, to dismiss the latest intervention by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), Britain’s independent human rights regulator, which has cautioned the Scottish Government on the move and has urged a pause in the legislative process, citing the risk of “extending the ability to change legal sex from a small defined group who have demonstrated their commitment and ability to live in their acquired gender, to a wider group who identify as the opposite gender at a given point.”It adds: “The potential consequences include those relating to the collection of data, participation and drug testing in competitive sport, measures to address barriers facing women and practices within the criminal justice system.”Given the respect the EHRC enjoys within the political and legal establishment across the country, one might have expected Scottish ministers to consider this thoughtful contribution to their consultation seriously. They haven’t, though. Within hours of receipt of the letter, a spokesman told the media that it would have no impact on the Scottish Government’s legislative timetable.At the same time various (publicly funded) trans pressure groups have resorted publicly to attacking the EHRC itself. Tim Hopkins, director of the Equality Network, chose to play the nationalists’ favourite card by dismissing the EHRC as a lackey of the hated Westminster government: “We do not need UK government appointees telling us in Scotland how to legislate in devolved areas.” No doubt Mr Hopkins would have been just as outraged if the EHRC had intervened to support the Scottish Government’s legislative timetable.He need not worry either way. Moves to increase trans rights, even at the expense of women’s rights and in the face of opposition by the EHRC, is confirmation that trans ideology is less about human rights than about politics. When a considered, accurate and thoughtful request from Britain’s human rights regulator can be so easily and swiftly dismissed by Holyrood ministers, and when Scottish Government-funded trans rights ideologues can use nationalist dog whistling to undermine a profoundly important body like the EHRC, the issue can hardly be anything other than political.Sturgeon’s support for trans rights is undoubtedly sincere. It’s a matter of regret that she and her publicly-funded supporters in civic Scotland turn such a deliberately blind eye to the rights of women. More from NewsWork from home tax loophole to be closed after it cost Treasury £500 millionRishi Sunak fighting hard to stop invoking Article 16, claim Boris Johnson’s alliesGPs told to resume face-to-face appointments as focus shifts from rollout of Covid booster vaccinesA toxic Tory civil war is brewing – and it threatens to leave the party in ruinsNHS officials took £70,000 drug company bribes, then ‘switched’ patients’ medication, court toldBoris Johnson urged to sack more No 10 staffers amid fears ‘partygate’ reset will not be enoughMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ben wallace admits not optimistic","story":"Ben Wallace admits he is not optimistic Russian incursion into Ukraine can be stoppedDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said he is not optimistic that an invasion of Ukraine could be halted.

However, he added: ‘’I’m not optimistic.’’ The former officer also confirmed would soon meet with Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow. The US has rejected Russia’s demand for a veto on Ukraine’s membership of the Nato military alliance. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken offered no concessions - but said that he was offering Russia “a serious diplomatic path forward, should Russia choose it”.  But Russian President Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov said “there isn’t much reason to be optimistic” about a solution. Moscow needed time to analyse the US response and would not “rush into assessments”, he added. The US has also threatened to halt the opening of a key pipeline that would send Russian gas to Western European invasion goes ahead.  Nord Stream  would run from Russia to Germany and officials in Berlin have said the project could face sanctionsRussia attacks.It comes after Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK is not ruling out support for personal sanctions against Mr Putin. Ms Truss made the comments after US President Joe Biden suggested moving to penalise the Russian president could be an option.Russia denies it is planning an attack but the build-up of tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine’s borders has heightened fears of an invasion.

When Covid first struck the Government turned places of sanctuary into deathtraps by transferring patients from hospitals to homes without testing them for the virus.Lockdown rules prevented friends and families from visiting loved ones. These restrictions were necessary but came at a heavy price. Many vulnerable and elderly people were cut off from the outside world and denied the comfort of a visit by their nearest and dearest. This took a terrible toll on their health and mental wellbeing. Which is why the decision to ease strict Covid measures for care homes in England from Monday will be so welcome. Safety must remain a priority. The battle against the virus is far from won. But this is an important step back that will mean so much to those who have sacriced so much in the past two years. Purse stings Foreign Secretary Liz Truss once pledged a “zero-tolerance” approach to wasteful government expenditure. When it comes to her own behaviour she adopts a very dferent approach. The Foreign Secretary reportedly blew £, of taxpayers’ money on a private jet to Australia when she could have travelled by commercial flights for a fraction of the cost. This is not the only time she has been so carefree with our money. She spent £, on dinner at a private club owned by a Tory donor. It is not just the double standards which is so sickening. It is that she insists on living the high le at our expense while supporting measures that will leave the poorest worse off.

Campaigners have accused Ms Truss of exuding “shocking privilege” by riding an “outrageous source of carbon emissions”. Ms Truss set off for Australia on January  at noon from London’s Stansted Airport. Her private journey had two pit stops, according to flight data, with one -minute stop at Dubai and another at Kuala Lumpur. She touched down in Sydney shortly after midnight on Thursday January  - with her journey being catalogued by a taxpayer-funded PR photographer. If she had travelled via business class on a Qantas Airways flight, the Foreign Secretary could have arrived in Australia five hours earlier.  And she would not have spent as many carbon emissions because the flight from London would have taken her straight from London Heathrow to Adelaide, Australia. An aviation source told the Independent the cost of operating Ms Truss’s trip would have been “at least £,”, while the most expensive business-class tickets which also offers lie-flat beds would have cost just over £,. A Foreign Office source told the Mirror Ms Truss needed to fly privately so she can work securely and have the flexibility to set off to another destination in the event of a crisis in another region, such as Eastern Europe. Labouraposs Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said: Liz Truss shows the public exactly quite how little respect this Conservative Government has for taxpayersapos money with her ridiculous waste of half a million pounds on a private jet trip.This Government is brazen in its disregard for upholding decency. It is obscene that Government Ministers are jet setting yet are hiking taxes and refusing to do anything to help working families when they are feeling the pinch of the cost of living crisis. Tories waste disgusting amounts of public money on their own vanity and comfort, Labour wants to see families see a cut to energy bills - that is the dference. Ms Truss defended herself saying I used the Government plane - that is why we have a Government plane: to enable Government ministers to conduct Government business, and thataposs what I flew to Australia in. Pressed on whether it would have been better to have used commercial flights instead, the Cabinet minister said: Every Government decision is based on value for money. We have a Government plane specically so ministers, like me in my role as Foreign Secretary, can go and do the work overseas, which is ultimately delivering for the British people.  Liberal Democrat Business Spokesperson Sarah Olney MP added: “This is a staggering waste of taxpayer’s cash at a time many families are feeling the pinch. “Once again we see just how out of touch this Conservative government truly is to the millions of people struggling to get by. “Liz Truss should apologise for jetting around on ‘Air Force Sun’ and assure the public she won’t waste their money in this way again.” Ms Truss used the private Airbus A to, from and around Australia, the newspaper said. It has luxury interiors including spacious soft cream-coloured seats that fold into lie-flat beds. The plane could seat around  people without luxury configuration, and even with luxury seats fits scores of passengers. The Foreign Office has not said how many people were in Ms Trussapos delegation. Emblazoned with the Union flag and the words United Kingdom, it is thought to be a privately-owned plane that is regularly leased to the government for official journeys.The same aircraft rushed Boris Johnson back from the COP summit in Glasgow to London in November, in what Labour branded “staggering hypocrisy”. The PM could have caught a train but taking the flight allowed him to make a dinner with Dailyjournalists at the men-only Garrick Club. The plane had been due toto London anyway because it had taken the PM to the G summit in Rome, then straight on to Glasgow.  At the time, No insisted it was one of the most carbon efficient planes of its size in the world”, producing % less CO than the government’s main Voyager plane. It runs on a “blend of % sustainable aviation fuel and % normal fuel, which is the maximum amount allowed and obviously the emissions will be offset”, No claimed in November. Reports claim Ms Truss spent two days meeting government officials in Australia before flying across to Adelaide where she gave a speech. She left Adelaide at .pm on January  according to Flightradar, with her plane once again refuelling at Kuala Lumpur and Dubai. Ms Truss’s plane arrived back at Stansted airport at  on January .Anna Hughes, director of Flight Free UK said: “ Liz Truss has consistently demonstrated her lack of understanding about the action that we all need to take to address the climate crisis, and this is no exception.“Flying to Australia and back on a chartered jet is shockingly privileged and an outrageous source of emissions in the current climate emergency.” In a policy paper called Back to Black which Ms Truss co-authored in  she, along with others, outlined how: “Every public sector worker should feel personal responsibility for the money they spend and the money they save. “They should spend taxpayers’ money with at least the care they would give to their own. “This change of mindset would be reflected in everyday changes such as travelling by economy rather than business class, to larger scale changes around focusing on value for money. “It should start at the very top with MPs reviewing the expenses they have become accustomed to claiming and filter down throughout the entire sector.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “It’s necessary for the foreign secretary to travel abroad to pursue UK interests around security, trade and technology, as she did during this visit to Australia. “This trip used government transport and was fully within rules set out in the Ministerial Code.” Ms Truss landed back In London a day before Cop president Alok Sharma said world leaders must “honour promises” on climate change.Mr Sharma told a Chatham House event: “Unless we honour the promises made, to turn the commitments in the Glasgow Climate Pact into action, they will wither on the vine. SNP Environment spokesperson Deidre Brock MP said: Yet again, Liz Truss has serious questions to answer over her grotesque misuse of taxpayersapos money to fund her jet set lestyle.Taxpayers will be appalled that the Tory Foreign Secretary has reportedly wasted over half a million pounds of our money on a luxury private jet trip - and emitted tonnes of unnecessary carbon emissions during a climate crisis. Ms Truss has a history of frittering away public funds. Only recently, she was criticised for splashing out over a thousand pounds on a single lunch, which saw her quaffing high-end wines in a Mayfair private members club owned by a Tory donor. With a record like this, Lavish Liz will make a fitting successor to Boris Johnson.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Liz TrussHeathrow AirportForeign OfficeStansted Airport Ltd.Climate changePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And he refusedTWICEto deny Boris Johnson has had discussions about scrapping the National Insurance hike.

Staff will pay .% on what they earn above a £-a-month threshold from April  - up from % now - in a bid to raise £bn a year for NHS and social care.At the same time, April will see the start of a four-year freeze on income tax thresholds. The p band will start at £, and p band at £,. Combined, the Resolution Foundation says these measures will leave the average household £ a year worse off, or .% of their disposable income, in  . However, these tax hikes will hit wealthier households harder than poorer ones - cutting more than £, from the richest twentieth, compared to less than £ cut from the poorest quarter. Energy bill rises also due in April could bring gas and electricity fees to % of the entire budget for Britain’s poorest households - up from .% last year. Ex-minister David Davis has publicly demanded a rethink while Lord Frost, who quit the Cabinet over tax rises, said it was “never necessary or justied”. Boris Johnson’s official spokesman was grilled repeatedly today on whether the National Insurance rise will go ahead as planned. Askedthe PM has had any discussions about delaying the rise, he replied: “Umm, err… there are no plans to delay the levy. “Erm, I’ve said on a number of occasions now what that levy will achieve - addressing the backlog in our NHS and fixing the long-standing problems with our social care.” Asked a second time he replied: “I’m not getting into inidual discussions the Prime Minister has on specic policies. There are no plans to change the levy or alter the levy.” Askedthe PM guaranteed the levy will go ahead as planned in April, he replied: “Like I say, there are no plans to remove or delay the levy. “It’s vital we are responsible with the public finances to avoid burdening future generations with higher debt.” Asked a second time, he replied: “I can only repeat what I’ve said I’m afraid.” Asked a third time, he replied: “I’m just simply saying our position hasn’t changed, there are no plans to remove or delay the levy.” Askedit was fair to interpret that No was not ruling out a delay he replied: “I will leave that to you.” In a report published today, the Commons Treasury Committee warned that the rise in employer national insurance contributions would drive up inflation.The committee pointed to an OBR forecast, stating that the policy mix chosen at thisBudgetwill act as a boost to inflation, identying in particular the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions, and the large fiscal loosening that took place in the Spending Review.Mr Johnsonaposs aim for higher wage growth risks a wage price spiralproductivity doesnapost rise, the MPs said.Splits are emerging among top Toriesover the hike amid alarm about the looming cost of living crisis for families. Work and Pensions SecretaryTherese Coffeyinsisted on Thursday it would go ahead despite behind-the-scenes lobbying from some Tories for it to be scrapped.It should go ahead. That’s what’s been decided,” she told Times Radio. But the Prime Ministeraposs authority has taken a battering over the ongoing Downing Street partygate saga, giving angry Tories more leverage to press for the tax rise to be scrapped. Labour has slammed the National Insurance hike, only a small fraction of which will fund a plan for social care in its first three years.Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said earlier: “With inflation at its highest level in three decades, the cost of living crisis is only going to get worse in the coming months. The Prime Minister and Chancellor are whacking up business and working peopleaposs taxes at the worst possible time. With even their own Conservative MPs outraged, they should think again before the National Insurance rise hits hard in April. People are already feeling the crunch from cost of living, but the triple whammy of an imminent rise in the energy price cap, real wages falling and Tory tax rises coming down the tracks are going to make this crisis even worse.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyCabinetNHSGeorge OsborneBoris JohnsonTaxPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People believe wearing facial coverings are “for the greater good”.The measures which were introduced ahead of Christmas to curb the Omicron iant, were scrapped yesterday.It means people are no longer legally required to wear face masks indoors. But public health guidance, which suggests people wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where they come into contact with strangers, will stay in place. Despite this supermarkets and rail operators have urged people to continue wearing their facial coverings to keep their staff safe.  Both Sainsbury’s and John Lewis said their customers will be asked to wear masks, though the latter acknowledged it will ultimately come down to “personal choice”. Carol Grant, , from Newcastle said she will persevere with wearing them despite feeling discomfort. Itaposs not nice and I feel like I canapost breathe but itaposs worth it for safety. Iaposve been quite careful over the past couple of years and managed to avoid it so far so I plan on doing the same now. I think itaposs good that Sainsburyaposs are enforcing it, itaposs for the greater good.

Rebecca Addinell, store assistant of KODA at Paragon Arcade, believed it would take some time for people to stop wearing a mask, even as the restrictions have been lted. I prefer to wear it and I will continue to wear it for at least a few more weeks. I donapost ask people to put a mask on, but when people come in and see me wear one, they tend to put theirs on too. Rob Froggett, , said: In shops I will continue to wear a mask. I have never had a problem with wearing it. It has helped and you have got to protect people who are having to work.  Trade union Usdaw, which represents , retail workers, urged customers to continue to observe Covid safety measures.

At the time, Covid restrictions prevented the mingling of dferent householdsBoris Johnson pictured during Prime Ministers Questions in the House of Commons this week Image: PAByChris Daw QC:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |comments Boris Johnsonaposs political fate hangs in the balance as he anxiously awaits Sue Grayaposs report on lockdown parties across Downing Street and Whitehall. More than  parties have been uncovered across Downing Street, Whitehall and Tory HQ while millions suffered under lockdown rules and the Prime Minister is accused of attending at least five of the events.The Mirror led the way in revealing the first parties and we also revealed No staff had “wine time Fridays” scheduled every week and would dash to the local Tesco Express with a wheelie suitcase to stock up their £ wine fridge. As Boris Johnson faces mounting pressure to resign, the politan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick confirmed that her officers will look into a number of events where Covid lockdown rules were allegedly broken in No  and Whitehall. Now Chris Daw QC looks into six of the parties and how he thinks they broke coronavirus rules.All of the No  gatherings below took place at a time when legal regulations, imposed on the nation by Boris Johnson and his Government, prevented the mingling of iniduals and households, save in truly exceptional and essential circumstances.Let me take you through why each one of them was against the law.May , BYOB party in No  garden attended by Boris Johnson, who claimed he stayed for  minutes and thought it was a work event. May  was a dark time. We were not allowed to travel, let alone socialise, save in the most limited circumstances, as Oliver Dowden explained in the press conference on the day that Partygate really got started. What he did not say was: If you are at work you can invite as many people you like for a massive p*** up after you finish for the day. The reason he did not say that is simple - nobody in his right mind could have argued that an outdoor party drinking session for dozens of people in the bossaposs garden was taking place under the work exemption in the Covid regulations. I have no doubt that this event, at least as reported, amounted to a flagrant breach of the rules at the precise point in time when the Government was threatening the public with fines and prosecutionthey organised or attended any social gathering at all. June , Boris Johnsonaposs surprise birthday party with cake thrown by we Carrie in the Cabinet room. Carrie Johnson has no official role at Number . She does not work there. Evenshe did work there, she was not legally permitted to organise a personal birthdayfor her husband or anyone . Why  Because nobody was allowed to have birthday parties in June , whether with work colleagues as guests or not.Parties, make no mistake, were banned under the Covid regulations, which made it unlawful to gather indoors with members of a dferent household, save for the purpose of work. To make the legal analysis really simple and clear - attending a birthday party, surprise or otherwise, organised by your we, does not come under the definition of work. November , A party in the PM and Carrieaposs flat - denied by No  - on the night Dominic Cummings quit Downing Street.It is hardly surprising that some in No  were in a celebratory mood, following the departure of Dominic Cummings, who had tied himself in knots to explain his y and unlawful lockdown drive to Barnard Castle.But the alleged late-night victory party with huge quantities of booze and loud music, in a residential flat, was clearly against Covid regulations at the time. December , Boris Johnson hosts virtual No  Christmas Quiz although most participants were in the office. It is true to say that the official guidance was not, strictly speaking, the law of the land. The Covid regulations simply prevented social mixing between households subject to the work purposes exemption. But... the official guidance did no more than stating the obvious. If you are the Prime Minister, hosting a quiz, completed unconnected to official business, in the company of staff who are drinking alcohol, is not work. It was primarily social activity and, as such, completely prohibited under the Tier  Rules.December , The original No  Christmas party with a Secret Santa and nibbles and wine. When it suits the Government, Downing Street becomes one massive household bubble, with hundreds of people all free to intermingle to their heartsapos content. Here we are told that Boris Johnson was holed up in his office, working away on the nationaposs Christmas plans, while dozens of his colleagues partied the night away. Either Boris Johnson really was completely oblivious to the unambiguous law-breaking on his watch, or he had no control of No  at all. Neither scenario showers him in glory, let alone enhances the credibility of his denials of responsibility for so many events under his own roof. April ,  aposSuitcase of wine’ party on eve of Prince Philip ’s funeral.Set aside the poor taste of a wine-fuelled disco in the PMaposs house, on the eve of one of the Queenaposs toughest days since her ascension to the throne, this event took place during yet another period of severe legal restrictions on household mixing. Very few of us can undertake our work duties while under the influence of alcohol - booze during work hours makes for dangerous situations and very poor decisions. The same applies to those running the country and especially to No . They cannot have it both ways - either they were off duty and should not have been drinking and socialising together at all or they were getting drunk at the wheel of our whole country, during a time of national crisis. The evidence points strongly to this being a purely social event. Chris Daw QC is a barrister, broadcaster and author of the bestselling book, Justice on Trial.

The release date of Sue Gray’s inquiry has been thrown into chaos after the Met Police announced it was investigating a “number of” the gatherings to seethey broke the law. On Tuesday it was claimed Sue Grayaposs report could be released in full because the Met Police had given the green light. But the Mirror now understands that claim was inaccurate. In fact, government and police officials are still locked in talks about whether Grayaposs report will prejudice the police inquiry.All the while, Boris Johnson ’s future hangs in the balance - with Tory MPs waiting to seethey will try to oust him.No today confirmed the Prime Minister has not been interviewed by police - yet. But didn’t rule it out in future.  So what on earth is going on and when will we actually see the damn thing  Here’s everything you need to know…What is the Sue Gray report  Top civil servant Sue Gray is investigatinga string of parties between May  and April  - mostly in No and its garden.The -year-old took over the inquiry from Cabinet Secretary Simon Case after it emerged a party had been held in his own office. Her probe was set up to get “a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”. That means saying who attended, the “setting and the purpose”, and “reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time”. But she cannot rule whether the PM broke the lawor the Ministerial Code . And the names of junior staff are likely to be kept anonymous. Disciplinary action will be kept secret too. When is the Sue Gray report due - and why is it delayed Her report was due this week, but thrown into chaos after the Met Police began investigating “a number of” the gatherings. Government and police officials are wrangling over whether publication of the report could prejudice a police investigation. First the report was set to be delayed, then split in two - then it emerged Ms Gray was planning to issue her full report after all, this week. But in fact, it’s still tied up in talks with the police about exactly what can be published . Downing Street - which has control over when the report is published - had still not received the report as of .pm on Thursday.  Hopes it will be published this week are fading. That’s because Boris Johnson has pledged to publish the report and give a statement in Parliament - which sits limited hours on Thursday and Friday, and needs advance notice of any statement. That meansit arrives with Downing Street after about pm on Friday, it’s unlikely to be published before Monday at the earliest. No said on Thursday: “It remains hypothetically possible to publish it today or tomorrow. “But we will need to keep in close contact with the Speaker about the Parliamentary process that would flow from that.” If Sue Gray gives No the report at night, Boris Johnson will “probably seek to publish it the following day,” the PM’s spokesman said.Why is there so much confusion over the release date Confusion has been fuelled by briefing, counter-briefing and guesswork by anonymous MPs all feeding into reporting. But the Mirror understands it was worsened by a major mix-up over exactly what the Met Police were saying about the report. Police sources suggested on Tuesday that Scotland Yard had no objection to Sue Grayaposs report being published in full. This could be because lockdown breaches are punished with fixed penalty notices, so there’s barely any chance of prejudicing a jury. But the Mirror now understands this was not, in fact the case. The opposite was actually true, and Scotland Yard still had questions over the report. On Thursday No confirmed discussions were “continuing” about the “interplay between report and the Met’s work”. Ominously, the PM’s deputy official spokesman refused to rule out the entire report being delayed after all, until the Met probe finishes. “That would be a matter for the investigation team,” he said. “That’s not a question I can answer.” How will the Sue Gray report be published Sue Gray will send a complete report to Downing Street, and will probably present it directly to Boris Johnson first. Downing Street has then promised to publish it as soon as possible - which most people are interpreting as a few hours. Following this, Boris Johnson will come to Parliament to make a statement. This is to be accountable to MPs, but also to ‘own the narrative’ - for instance by publicly sacking staff or vowing to make amends. The Prime Minister’s diary for the weekend was still up in the air on Thursday night, with No unable to sayhe’d be at Chequers. Will the Sue Gray report be published in full No have repeatedly promised to publish the full findings of Sue Gray - in other words, the same report she hands to No. Boris Johnson today said of course it would be released in full while No said: “It remains our intention to publish what we receive from the investigation team.” Downing Street does still have the power to censor or cut out bits of the report, a power which has some people worried. But perhaps the more relevant question is how much Sue Gray’s report will be “self-censored” before it gets to No. The Mirror understands it will not contain all the evidence she received, only a summary, and could leave out inidual staff names.

Tory MPs need to send no confidence letters to trigger a leadership challenge, and many are waiting for the outcome of Sue Gray’s report before deciding whether to send a letter. One Tory elected in  told the Mirror things had “quietened down in the past week”, adding: “Sometimes you get to the precipice, look over and go ‘aagh!’. “Most of the Tory MPs Iaposve spoken to in the last few days seem to think he will get through it.” But they warned: “People are not so much waiting for the Sue Gray report as for how the Prime Minister responds afterwards.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Downing Street party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"covid infections rise across uk","story":"Covid infections on rise across UK as Plan B ends - see full list of cases in your areaNewry, Mourne  Down in Northern Ireland continues to have the highest rate in the UK, with , new cases in the seven days to January  - the equivalent of ,. per , peoplethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-registers-further-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:JWWLPiJi,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Marc Holdsworth, , has coached Olympic medalists, Tom Daley, Jack Laugher and Matty Lee from pool to podium while secretly facing a devastating battle.Aged , the athlete was diagnosed with Friedrich’s Ataxia - a condition that attacks the nerves which control muscles around the body. This can lead to problems with balance, mobility, vision and speech. After a nasty fall earlier this month, Marc was left unable to walk without a simmer frame. He also requires surgery to repair his anterior cruciate ligament. Brave Marc had never spoken publicly about his diagnosis, but now he has revealed all to The Mirror. He said: “When I speak to the Ataxia nurses and they tell me how well I am doing, I break down. “It’s important for me to stand on my own two feet for as long as I can. “One of the reasons I don’t openly talk about it is that I don’t want to be treated any dferently because I have it. “It would mean the world to be able to keep coaching, I started ing when I was just  so it has been my le. “There’s a lot more moving around than people realise, you have to examine the es from all angles and you’re doing lots of moving between dferent people, I’m not just sitting on a chair at the side of the pool. “Not being able to do what I love is heartbreaking.” Living with Ataxia is like “constantly walking on a balancing beam” Marc says, who also suffers from muscle soreness, fatigue and hypermobility. The latter of those symptoms actually meant he was ‘fine-tuned’ to be a er in his younger years, but he knew something was wrong when he noticed he was unable to do simple things. He said: “I could do somersaults on the floor and arm stands which were great party tricks but I noticed that I couldn’t do simple things like carrying a cup of coffee from one side of the room to another. “I thought that was strange considering the amount of training I had. When I got given the news it was devastating. “The way it was explained was thatI had been diagnosed at  years old I would have been in a wheelchair by the age of . “I was really worried, I was an athlete so was immediately asking questions about what this meant. “They didn’t really have any concrete evidence of what would happen to me. “I have just been trying to keep fighting and enjoying le because it’s degenerative over time. “It’s not at a point where I need a wheelchair but I am on a restricted driving licence which is assessed every year and I have a blue badge.”  Now Marc coaches young ers at the City of Leeds Diving club but has been unable to get to the poolside for months as a result of the injury which is compounded by his condition. In a bid to help him get back on his feet as soon as possible, parents at the club have set up a GoFundMe to raise nearly £, to pay for the operation privately. Overwhelmed by the kindness and support he has had, Marc is determined to raise as much awareness as possible around Ataxia when he is finally able to walk again. Michelle Sharman, whose daughter Jaeda es at the club, is leading the fundraising efforts but admitted that before learning of his condition she thought Marc was always drunk. She said: “I didn’t know about Marc’s condition when I first met him but he always appeared drunk. “The dference in the ers since Marc joined the club is unbelievable. “Jaeda has gone from wanting to quit the sport to finding her love of ing all over again. “When he told me what he was going through it was a no-brainer that we were going to do as much as we could to help.”For more information about Ataxia click here https:www.ataxia.org.uk Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tom DaleyJack LaugherTeam GBEducationSchoolsSwimmingDiving\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The new changes to the Highway Code will place more responsibility on road users and it will be a criminal offence to disobey them. More publicised offences, such as making phone calls whilst driving, are already deemed unacceptable in our society but simple things such as throwing a cigarette out of a window are what we see on journeys every day, and often without consequence.  We are reminding road users to be considerate of other road users and obey driving laws for their own safety and the safety of others whilst travelling.”With a whole new set of codes about to come into action, read on for easy to miss rules already in place, according to CarMoney. Crossing this line can cost you up to £ and can even add three points to your licence. Advanced Stop Lines, or ASLs, mark areas reserved for cyclists. Motorists who crawl over the line and into the box risk getting slapped with both the fine and the points. Using phone to change playlist while driving New laws aimed at cutting out dangerous driving now state that people changing the song on their phone while they drive can be hit with a fine. This also includes doing things like taking pictures or videos. Doing anything of the like can get you slapped with a £ fine. While driving on the phone was outlawed in , this new change catches up with other phone usage laws, making motorists who use their phone in dferent ways responsible for dangerous driving. Throwing cigarette out of a car window  “Incorrect disposal of a cigarette” can land motorists a fixed penalty notice fine of anywhere between £ and £ because throwing your butts out of the window is no dferent from littering. Although smoking in a car is not a crime as long as the passengers are over , this fine was introduced to limit littering and prevent the casual discarding of plastic-based butts to align with current littering laws Having a dirty number plate In winter, it can be very easy for muck and grime to build up on you licence plate from driving on wet roads. But failure to keep your plate clear and visible can result in a huge £, fine. If your plate is unreadable then you are going against the Highway Code, which says: Lights, indicators and number plates must be kept clean and clear. So make sure to give your vehicle a good wipe down after driving on dirty roads. The Mirror has contacted the Department for Transport and DVSA for comment.The roads can be dangerous in the cold weather, especially when there’s snow and ice.

The Isle of Rona, Inner Hebrides, Scotland, has just two permanent inhabitants and four cottages - three of which are available as holiday homes. The island hopes a live-in couple may be able to move to the island as estate workers.

Speaking to Seth Myers on the Late Night Show, Jeremy was a bit mfed when quizzed about his purchase when he asked the host: How do you know that .

Child psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos today urges parents to be aware of the pressure on kids and to “focus on what is on the inside”. The TV doctor says social media stars, often with millions of followers, can make ­teenagers feel worse about their bodies by posting heavily ­photoshopped snaps, or by flaunting the results of extreme workouts or cosmestic surgery. It comes after the launch of the Mirror’s Keep Kids Safe Online campaign, amid growing concern at how young people are being groomed, bullied and exploited online. Carolyn Bunting MBE, CEO of the Internet Matters charity, says parents need to be aware of the accounts their children are following online. She says: “Teenage years are a crucial time where young people explore their identity. “It’s vital to talk to your children about their online le and let them know you’re there for themthey need to talk to you, so you can pick these kind of problems up at the earliest opportunity.”  Bad influencers  Chloe FerryFormer Geordie Shore star Chloe, , has spent more than £, on procedures to change her figure drastically, regularly sharing her Kim Kardashian-like physique to her .million Instagram followers.Joey Turner The -year-old former TOWIE star frequently posts images of his dramatic weight loss on his Instagram, which is followed by more than , people. Georgia HarrisonThe former Love Island star, , who has . million Instagram followers, was slammed by advertising watchdogs in  for promoting diet gummies. They also ruled that it looked asthe picture had been edited to make her waist “look articially thin”.Khloe Kardashian The -year-old reality star is regularly accused by followers of “editing” her snaps to make her waist thinner or her bum bigger. Kendall Jenner The -year-old model, who rose to fame on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has shared photos to her  million Instagram followers of her extremely elongated frame, including this image in a tiny red bikini.  Show our young their talents matter more than looks By Dr Linda Papadopoulos For years young people have been coming to me for help because they have an eating disorder or mental health issue relating to their body image. When once the talk often centred around numbers such as being a size zero like catwalk models or ­celebrities they would see in magazines, today things have moved on quite alarmingly. Now they are bringing in hashtags. “Bikini bridge”, “thigh gap” or “eight pack” or whatever the latest craze demands. They are the victims of the selfie generation – those who have grown up in the age of social media where taking a snap of themselves and posting it online is a normal part of their day. But not everyone really understands the impact this is having on the young people attempting to live up to the constant stream of perfect bodies they see online every day.Many of the most followed influencers and celebrities regularly post their perfect physique, excessive workout regime and restrictive diets online, but fail to show they are editing theirphotos to make them look perfect – giving ­children unrealistic health and body image goals.A study of more than , girls aged between  to  in  countries found more than half had low body image. It is a huge issue for children, as body image is so closely associated with ­identity, self-worth and consequently self-esteem and therefore can have a signicant impact on a young person’s behaviour and decision making. The problem lies not so much in how we see ourselves but to a greater extent how we think others see us.  Of course, the desire to explore and manipulate our identity is a normal part of growing up. But up until recently, this was done in front of the mirror, experimenting with clothes, hairstyles and makeup. And the only people giving you feedback would be the people you know. Now, young people have a new ­audience – the whole world. The way we gain access to ­information about body image is partly through other people’s reaction to us. Sadly, many of these reactions are now coming from complete strangers who have no vested interest in ensuring we value or feel positive about ourselves. If you think about the process of posting images on social media, it is largely an exercise in poor body image. Research from Internet Matters suggests the age we are most likely to give children their first mobile phone is aged . Critically, this is also when ­children – especially girls – become most aware of their social equity, or in other words how other people see them. They are taking pictures of ­themselves, swiping through their phones to find the “least worst”, then editing those pictures. Effectively they are looking for things they don’t like about their bodies and altering them so that they are more acceptable to be seen by others. Once posted, the waiting for ­validation begins with likes and comments. If the likes do not come in sufficient numbers they feel rejected and eventhey do, all it does is leave them wanting more. In general, studies suggest children posting the most tend to have the worst self-esteem because they feel the need to seek validation and social acceptance from others, in effect handing over their power to feel good about themselves to others that don’t even really know them. They are saying, “I don’t knowI look good butyou tell me, then I feel OK.”  As kids get older, this need for validation can develop into hyper sexualisation and the desire to be desired takes precedence over anything . In order to be desired, you look around to see what others want. And the goalposts keep moving. Be skinny, be curvy, be skinny, be both at the same time. You can never win. It is not just girls who are experiencing these issues. A study from Internet Matters and Youthworks found nearly a third of boys in the UK said they had been exposed to content online encouraging them to build up their bodies. So it is not only images that they end up feeling they need to edit but their actual bodies. People are coming in to see plastic surgeons and asking to look like the altered, edited pictures of themselves. Kids have never engaged with their physical image in the way they have since the advent of social media. I can count on one hand how many picture albums I have of me as a child. Now, it is relentless. Worse than that, we are no longer just comparing ourselves to our cousins, sisters, and friends, we are comparing ourselves to the edited versions of our cousins, sisters and friends – plus all the celebrities and influencers. The solutions to issues of body image are not easy to fix – everyone must play their part, from lawmakers and tech makers through to parents and teachers. As parents, it is vital we are speaking to our kids right now, understanding the issues more, helping them through. We must teach our children the way they look is a part of them and not all of them, constantly emphasising their other attributes. Whenever someone called my daughter pretty I’d chip in, “she’s great at maths and great at judo too”. I wanted her to know the most interesting things about her were not things people immediately see. She needed to see that value in herself even when others wouldn’t. While everyone talks about what is on the outside, it is up to you as a parent to focus on what is on the inside. You need to ensure your kids don’t distil their worth down to thigh gaps and perfect skin but rather develop an ­identity that makes them feel good about their talents and achievements. Our demands  Strengthen the Online Safety Bill to comprehensively protect children from abuse and harmful content. Make Facebook and Instagram prove their plans for end-to-end encryption won’t put children at risk. An online kids champion to fight for their interests.  A levy on tech firms to pay for campaigns and online safety classes in schools.

The five-year-old has been described as a “true rescue dog” after being rescued by the RSPCA in May . It is thought Alfie, a lurcher crossbreed, had a tough start to le - but is seeking a “fresh start with a kind, caring and committed adult family”. An RSPCA statement reads: “I don’t understand why nobody wants me  I have been waiting for someone to offer me a home for three years. “I have seen all my friends find new homes and still here I wait, hoping next time it might be me, but it never is.  “Is there no one out there who wants me  I deserve a home after everything I have been through. I am a true rescue dog”. Alfie loves playing with toys, going for walks and having a “good back scratch”. He walks well on a lead but has not been well-socialised with other dogs and will need help in this area. The RSPCA statement adds: “Alfie has not had a normal le, so his new owners need to be prepared to offer him some professional aposone-to-oneapos training to help improve his socialisation skills around other dogs and settle into a new home and routine. Ideally his new owners should be experienced dog owners. He needs a home with a good sized, private, secure garden with ft fencing where he can be allowed to have free time off the lead. He is not suitable to live with cats, dogs or small furries.” The animal charity would love to match Alfie with a loving family who can devote their time to spoiling him and showing him the world can be a happy place.If you’re interested in rehoming Alfie, or would like to request more information about him, please contact Southrige Animal Centre on    or emailmapsouthridge@rscpa.org.uk .The RSPCA statement reads: “Please before beginning the application process for an animal from Southridge, double check that the home you can offer meets Alfie`s needs. “We would very much like to be able to respond to every adoption application we receive, however at the moment this is just not possible for us to do. “Therefore, unless your application matches the required criteria we will not be able to email you back, similarlywe receive your application after the animal you are interested in has been reserved. “Thank you very much for considering adopting one of our animals.

However, the -year-old from Nottingham was actually having a stroke and ended up needing emergency surgery to remove part of her skull. Helen was working late, doing floor management at an outdoor event in August  when she first noticed numbness creeping up her left arm. The following day, she developed pain in her head, and lost movement in the left side of her body.Helen said: “It scared me because I lost all control of my arm and hand. The pain was like a migraine in the front area of my head.It was excruciating. Helen called  and said she was told it sounded like she had a migraine so she should take strong painkillers.  But, later that day Helen found her symptoms were getting worse and she began struggling to walk. An ambulance was called and she was taken to the Queen’s Medical Centre. The mum of five relied on her aunt and sister to step in to look after her children Dominic, , Kylah, , Alistar, , Izack,  and Miah, . However, when she arrived in AE, Helen claimed that doctors told her her symptoms were down to a hangover.  She said: “When I went to hospital, I couldn’t walk properly, my left leg was completely numb. “I knew something was very wrong but I was told that I was acting drunk and was obviously just hungover. “I’d been at work the night before until very late so I only had a little to drink. I was in no way drunk and take my job very seriously. I also had a ligament injury at the time but I had left my crutches at home and was holding onto seats and the walls, which may have made me seem worse. I was told I just needed rest and rehydration.”  Helen ed home, but was back in hospital only the next day after her pain got worse. This time, she was told that she had suffered a stroke caused by a blot clot and that they needed to operate immediately. She added: I was very confused as I didnapost even know what a stroke was. They had to operate to remove part of my skull as the pressure on my brain was too much. The next thing I knew, I woke up in hospital with what felt like a fuzzy TV in my head. After the operation, she spent three months recovering. She had lost her speech at first but it ed quickly.  She was also being fed through a tube and had intense physio and occupational therapy to help her movement. It was particularly hard for Helen being in hospital during the Covid pandemic. Helen said: I remember walking up shortly after my op and thinking about my kids and worryingthere was enough food in the fridge. Those few months were tough. I was also dealing with changes to my body that I knew nothing of before and the physio was also very hard as I got a blood clot in the back of my knee which caused me a lot of pain.

The hardest part was when my sister bought my children up to see me but they had to see me through the window and were all crying, I couldnapost even give them a hug. That was soul-destroying. My mental health declined after that, I was an emotional wreck. Helen was discharged from the hospital on  November , after spending three long months away from her family. Helen said: “I was allowed to come home in November  and had carers until the following July.  I am still paralysed on the left side but have gained movement in my left leg so I can walk more now with a frame. But I’ve partially lost vision in my left eye and my left arm is still no good. Although it has been dficult, she is glad to be home and is thankful for all the help she has had from family and friends. She added: My dad has been a godsend helping any way he can and my friends have all been amazing. They even sorted out my house out so it was ready for me for when I was discharged from the hospital.  On discharge, we had a team of family and friends to help care for me who have all been amazing. Despite everything, Helen is now able to walk aided around the block and recently managed to walk over , steps. She is now taking part in the Stroke Associationaposs Stride for Stroke campaign by attempting to walk  steps and raise at least £ for the charity. She also wants to raise awareness that strokes can happen to anyone, young or old. Helen said: “I joke with my sister that I feel like Captain Tom walking around with a frame. I’ve been able to walk a couple of thousand steps now, that’s why I wanted to do this challenge for the Stroke Association. I’ll be walking  steps and I want to raise £ at least too.  I’ve lost so much since my stroke but in sharing my story on my ‘Helen’s road to recovery’ page. I’ve had amazing support and been able to provide support to others too.A spokesperson for Nottingham University Hospitals Trust said: “We would like to wish Ms Mullins all the best in her recovery and in her efforts for rising vital awareness and funds for the Stroke Association.We have not been contacted by Ms Mullins surrounding her care however we would encourage her to contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Serviceso we can look into any concerns.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsStroke\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rikki was strangled and posed naked in woods near his Peterborough home in November . His mum Ruth Neave was cleared of his murder following a trial in  but pleaded guilty to child cruelty and was jailed for seven years. Two decades later, a cold case review allegedly pointed to James Watson who was seen with the schoolboy on the day of his disappearance, jurors were told. Watson, who was  at the time of Rikkiaposs death, is now on trial for murder at the Old Bailey. On Thursday, Ms Neave was called to give evidence in Watsonaposs murder trial. She told jurors: I pleaded guilty because I was bullied into it and I did not know what I was pleading guilty to.  Speaking via video link, she said she was living in a three-bedroom house in Redmile Walk with three of her four children at the time Rikki went missing. Prosecutor John Price QC asked Ms Neave when you were askedyou had murdered your son, what answer did you give  to which she replied no I did not. When asked againthat was the truth, Ms Neave insisted positively the truth and nothing but the truth. She went on to say she was jailed for seven years and released in  after being convicted of child cruelty.  Jurors heard that Watson was seen with Rikki on the day he disappeared and that Watsonaposs DNA was found on Rikkiaposs clothes which were discovered in a wheelie bin. They were also shown pictures of the inside of the home, including the bedroom Rikki had shared with his older sister before she went in to care. Ms Neave told jurors that, by the time she was arrested on suspicion of Rikkiaposs murder in , her other children were also in care. The mum described calling  to report Rikki missing when he failed tohome from school on November  .  She said it was .pm the next day when a police constable informed her Rikkiaposs body had been found. Askedshe had been truthful to police, Ms Neave said: I had no reason to lie. What is the reason to lie about your own childaposs death  Ms Neave went on to describe events leading up to Rikkiaposs disappearance and told the court about a disagreement the day before he vanished. She recalled having a conversation with her son after he gave a neighbour some chocolates. The way I understood it he had given [her] a box of chocolates and not me, she told jurors.  I asked him why he didnapost give me any and he said aposwell thereaposs no reason why I would have got you anyapos. On the day Rikki disappeared, Ms Neave said she spent the night on the settee in the living room with her baby, fresh out of hospital after a bout of illness, sleeping nearby in a moses basket. In the morning, she woke Rikki at about .am and told him to get out of bed, get dressed, she said. She told jurors Rikki argued with his three-year-old sister, with the pair shouting and screaming.  He was fighting her, she was fighting him, she said. It p*d me off. It was early in the morning. When Rikki went downstairs, he asked about breakfast and was told it was already on the table, then said hello to Sheradyn, according to Ms Neave. Mr Price asked Ms Neave where she was when she last saw her son alive. I was at home in my living room. I was sitting up, dozing, trying to keep my eyes open, she answered. When asked what Rikki was doing the last time she saw him alive, she said: He was playing with Sheradyn. I was sitting there looking at them both, dozing.  The mum said Rikki was wearing his school unorm, including a white shirt and grey trousers, and later identied them after they were recovered from the wheelie bin. She told the court that Rikki had a Game Boy he was fond of that she thought had been taken by police after his murder. Jurors were shown images of items seized by police, including Game Boy headphones but not the handheld Nintendo console itself. Ms Neave will be cross-examined on Tuesday.

Izabela Kikosicka, , and her kids, five, , and , have been sofa surfing since November after they were asked to leave their temporary accommodation in Erith, Kent. She said she had no idea she and her children would have to pack their things and it felt like a “massive shock” when enforcement agents changed the locks to their home and forced the family out.She accused Waltham Forest Council, who arranged the temporary home for her in the London Borough of Bexley, of having “washed their hands” of her situation, MyLondon reports. She told The Sun Online: “I donapost understand how they can put someone on the streets and not care what is going to happen.” She claimed she was told to go to the council, who told her that she had to go back to Bexley, adding: “Thereaposs just no reply, no nothing. The council has not contacted me. They have washed their hands of me. Izabela, who works as a cleaner while training to be a midwe, was first offered the home when she was made homeless three years ago. Since leaving her temporary home in November, she has been staying with friends every night. All the family have are their clothes, everything  is in storage. She said she was told by the council that she was kicked out of her home because they had discharged their housing duty towards her after offering her a home  miles away in Derbyshire back in . She said she did not accept the offer at the time because it would have meant moving her kids away from their school, family and friends. Izabela said Bexley London Borough Council, the local authority for Erith, also denied any responsibility for her case. In an email sent by Bexley Council, she was told that she had “no local connection with this local authority” despite her children attending school there since . She continued: “The amount of constantly trying to find somewhere is exhausting. I feel like my le is falling apart. I am very worried for my kids. I canapost even really say anything to them because I donapost know myself.” A spokesperson for Bexley London Borough Council said: It is not our policy to disclose or discuss peopleaposs personal circumstances in the media.Waltham Forest Council councillor told Louise Mitchell, Cabinet Member for Housing and Homelessness Prevention told MyLondon : It’s a national scandal that benefits and wages don’t cover the cost of rent in London.We do everything we can to help families find stable homes when they are in an emergency. When we help families at risk of being made homeless, we cannot place them where they can’t afford to pay their rent and buy day-to-day essentials. We are proud of our housing record. The borough is undergoing the largest programme of homebuilding in a generation. We are doing everything we can to get as many new homes built at a rent people can afford. We call upon the Government to do more to tackle this crisis that affects millions up and down the country.

Chloe Pritchard, , says pieces of wall fall off during the day, water seeps in through several windows whenever it rains, there are cracks everywhere, and her three-year-old son is staying at his grandmotheraposs because it is affecting his health. The young mother also described how there is damp in the house and holes in the wall, which are covered up by wallpaper, NorthWalesLive reports. Chloe moved into the two bedroom house in Caernarfon, Wales with her two young children last November.  The -year-old was happy to find a bigger home for her growing family and was eager to move into the house as soon as possible. She says that the house initially appeared to be an improvement on her previous home, but within days of moving in, she says she realised that a lot of work was required to make it a safe environment for herself and her children.  Three months after moving in, she claims that no progress has been made by the social housing provider Adra in remedying the problems, as she keeps on discovering more issues with the house. Chloe said: Living in this environment is horrible, especially with two children and another one on the way. I canapost stop crying, I canapost eat or sleep here - itaposs no way to live. She said that heat can escape from the house easily, which leaves her having to keep the heating switched on throughout large parts of the day.  These issues are affecting the physical and mental health of her young children, she said. My young son lives mostly with my mum because he canapost stand being in the house. Thereaposs dust everywhere form the crumbling plaster which affects him badly because of his bronchitis. We have damp, some of the plaster is wet to the touch and parts of the walls crumble off at random parts of the day. The sockets are also exposed and thereaposs holes in the walls which are obviously dangerous for young children. The children are stressed out living here. My baby girl whoaposs just turned one wonapost settle and my three-year-old boy absolutely hates coming here. Heaposs always got a cold and his asthma plays up because of how cold, damp and dusty it is here. Heaposs missing school because of it as well. He sees me stressed and heaposs at that age now where that affects him and that just builds up, said Chloe. Chloeaposs baby is due in July and she feels that she is getting nowhere despite being in constant contact with Adra. As things stand, Chloe says, they are all staying in the same room as the others are not safe for her children. I canapost let my baby girl crawl around because the floor is so rough andI was to take my eye off of her for a second she could be sticking a finger into loose plaster or a hole in a wall. Weaposre all staying in one room at the moment because I canapost have my kids in any of the other rooms given the way they are at the moment - itaposs just not safe. Iaposm constantly told by people that these are not living conditions but when I bring the issue up with Adra - something Iaposve done many times - itaposs like theyaposre not interested. Weaposve had inspectors over who acknowledge that work needs to be done on the house but they say we just have to keep on living here and wait months on end for it to be done, Chloe said. Chloe said she feels asshe has exhausted all of her options. She says that she needs Adra to act urgently and that her current situation is not tenable for the long term. Dealing with her pregnancy and all it entails on top of living in this environment, she says, is a nightmare, and she has considered handing back the keys on several occasions.The only thing that is stopping her from doing so, she says, is her responsibility to her children. Iaposve come close on so many occasions to handing my keys back to Adra and just sleep on peopleaposs sofas but obviously with the children involved I canapost do that. I donapost feel like I have any options at the moment.  A spokesperson for Adra said: Providing good customer service and making sure our customers feel safe and comfortable in their home is a priority for us. Our customer moved into this house in November as part of a mutual exchange. In January we were notied about the issues involving some of the plastering in the property. To date we have carried out an inspection at the customeraposs home and have identied the work required which will be completed by the end of February. We will make sure the work is completed to a high standard.

It contains  denials as well as  instances in which the team said it lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations. There are also a handful of admissions in the document, in which the Duke demanded a trial by jury. Ms Gufre claims in , she was trafficked by billionaire and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with Prince Andrew in London when she was  - a minor in US law.  She also alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal at Epsteinaposs home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. The mum-of-three is suing Andrew for unspecied damages, which US lawyers say could easily be in excess of £ millionshe is successful. Below are the allegations made of the Duke and his responses.Claims denied by the Duke of Yorkaposs legal team The suit arises out of Defendantaposs sexual abuse of Ms Gufre when she was under the age of -years-old. She was lent out for sexual purposes to the Defendant, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Prince Andrew was a close friend of Ghislaine Maxwell. He has refused to cooperate with US authorities in their investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his co-conspirators. Once in the residence, Epstein and his co-conspirators would work in concert to impress and intimidate the young female with displays of vast wealth and power. They would brag about their connections to very powerful political and social figures, and display photographs of themselves with those figures around Epsteinaposs homes. They would normalize the sexual abuse by displaying photographs and art displaying nude females, and a massage table and spa related products in an effort to legitimize the area where the abuse was set to occur. Once abused, Epstein and Maxwell continued to manipulate their victims, using their financial power, promises, and threats to ensure that the victim ed as directed and remained compliant with their demands. Epstein and his lawyers would even gather information about the victims to use against themthey ever disobeyed him, and his homes were under constant surveillance.

Ferguson was admitted to Brigham and Womenaposs Hospital in Boston, USA in November because he has a hereditary condition causing his heart and lungs to fill with blood and fluid. His mum Tracey, dad David and girlfriend Heather Dawson spoke to Fox News to share their worry on Wednesday night.  David said: He had to get the vaccine in order to get that transplant. His heart deteriorated so much, so quickly, that they had to resort to open heart surgery and doing the L-VADmechanical pump. So now my boy has a pump - heaposs in recovery. He went through seven hours of surgery. Mum Tracey said the family are devastated by the news and explained her son got out of open heart surgery yesterday.  She added everyone is trying to stay hopeful. Tracey spoke to ABC News to say that her son is not an anti-vaxxer as he has all of his vaccines, but itaposs just that heaposs concerned about the Covid jab because of his current cardiac crisis.Ferguson is worried about the risk of inflammation of the heart from the Covid vaccine, although doctoraposs have said the risk of getting coronavirus is a lot more severe than a temporary inflammation of the heart. David Ferguson, however, said that to his son getting vaccinated is kind of against his basic principles, according to the Daily Mail. He said having principles that he really believes in makes him respect his son all the more. Heather, Fergusonaposs girlfriend, said they had been through a terrible ordeal.  She said itaposs a shame because his nurses and doctors have been amazing, but added that it was upsetting to have the possibility of a transplant dangled over her head only to have it taken away. The hospital explained that Ferguson had to be taken off the donor list because vaccines are needed to create both the best chance for successful operation and also the patientaposs survival after transplantation. Heather continued that Ferguson was already in a high risk category for the jab due to his heart problems. She wrote a long update on Go Fund Me on January  to share the latest update on Fergusonaposs health.  After almost  days in the hospital with no answers, DJ was finally seen by some of the best cardiac specialists last week, she said. After running countless tests and scans we learned that DJ is now in severe end stage heart failure, meaning that he is going to need a heart transplant to live. On top of the heart failure his heart is extremely swollen and dilated. The good news is that he went through all the testing to be put on the transplant list and passed with flying colors since heaposs young and healthy aside from the heart failure. With that being said he was accepted to be a candidate for heart transplant.  The bad news is that the transplant board will not actively list him due to his vaccination status. The hospital has protocols including a ban on alcohol and smoking and a requirement for the Covid vaccine for people needing transplants - which is common across the country.You can donate to DJ Fergusonaposs Go Fund Me here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsOrgan donationHeart transplantsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Eight months later, in September , Ceara had more surgery, undergoing a Brazilian butt lt with liposuction  and J Plasma to tighten and refresh the skin.

I love to workout now and Iaposm really into weightlting, running, and yoga. It takes time, dedication, failing, and learning to transform yourself but my biggest piece of advice is to stop chasing quick fixes and focus on smart consistent choices. Keto has been le changing for me personally but everything is trial and error so what works for me, might not work for everyone.

In the caption of the vid, which has clocked up over .k likes at the time of writing, she claried sadly this is very true. Putting on a brave face in the comments section, the disappointed woman joked about her trauma, revealing that the ring is now gone. Many of those commenting completely understood why the TikToker was so dismayed by her discovery, with one person remarking: It’s the fact that it was originally purchased for a dferent girl that would tip me over the edge. Others wrote that they were now rushing to Google their other halves, to which @hreb sighed that she hoped they don’t find anything like I did. When one person attempted to defend the man - remarking that a ring is a ring and that maybe he couldn’tit - others were quick to explain that they were completely missing the point. As one person put it: Regardless, he could have sold it and bought a new ring with the money.

This was back in . Carolineaposs parents bought the ,-year-old property to run as a BB, and the place has seen more than its fair share of unusual occurrences in the decades since. Over the years, the family has come across all sorts of strange and disquieting objects on the grounds of their Grade II-listed home, some of which point towards a dark and violent history. Itaposs understandbale why its earned its reputation as one of the most haunted houses in the world.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Carolineaposs late father, John Humphries was the first to unearth piles of bones, with the first discovery foynd buried beneath the living room flagstones along with a set of daggers. In more recent times, Caroline’s partner Mick discovered more bones beneath the staircase of a ground floor room, including a jaw, spine, femur bones, and a skull. A iner had previously told Carolineaposs father that there were children buried all over the place. After digging, John found the bones and the daggers buried together, a pairing which implied sacricial killing. Caroline, , said: “There was an archaeological report on the daggers and they said the dates of them are  but they were ‘of a great age’. Sadly the daggers, which were in a glass display case, were stolen around  when my father was in the house, showing a group of visitors around. They will be of great value and because of the scribblings on them, they could be linked to ritualistic killings. Following his macabre discovery, John took the bones to a specialist who advised him that they were definitely not animal bones, meaning that, in Carolineaposs words, the mystery of whose remains they are and why they were buried with daggers needs to be investigated.” A few years back, John also discovered a well-preserved -year-old mummied cat inside a wall during renovation work. Caroline believes the dead animal, which was in good condition due to the preserving lime render in the walls, had been placed there to keep any witches away from the home. The inn is said to be built on an ancient Pagan burial ground, making it a hotspot for paranormal investigations and ghost hunters. Countless bizarre happenings have been reported at the sight, including moving objects. Although the ancient inn dates back to , the settlement and building date back even further to at least AD or older. Itaposs believed to have once housed slaves, Catholic monks, and stonemasons who built the local St Maryaposs Church. To make matters even eerier, Caroline harbors suspicions that the two buildings are connected by an as of yet undiscovered secret cellar and passageway. She explained: “The caveat in the deeds from Whitbreads from when we bought it states that the building’s cellars have been bricked up but we still don’t know where they are.Have you got a spooky or unexplained story to share Email us at yourmirror@mirror Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GhostsArchaeology\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, theres a surreal and completely unexpected secret awaiting guests in the bedrooms Image: Inigo RightmoveByJulia BanimJulia BanimEmily Hall:,  Jan |commentsAn initially unassuming-looking townhouse in the northern town of Berwick-Upon-Tweed, Northumberland, is now on the market for £, which, from the outside at least, looks every bit the traditional home. However, the prospective buyer of this magnicent Grade II-listed property will need to have a colourful taste in home decor, with the house boasting two kaleidoscope-esque bedrooms, each with a full-sized art installation.The property is currently owned by Tod Hanson, an installation artist best known for his work with Greenpeace. Back in the s, Hanson memorably suspended an ft cut-out of Earth above the main stage at the Glastonbury Festival.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Hanson is now selling the unique bedroom installations alongside his home which, with walls filled with mesmerising patterns, give the feel of being inside a kaleidoscope.Sharing pictures of the house, which is listed on Rightmove with an asking price of £, by London-based estate agents Inigo, on Twitter, Hanson wrote: “I am selling my house, including two installation interiors.”As per the sale description the magnicent Grade II-listed is understood to unfold over five storeys with the four five bedroom house extending to more than , sq ft internally. The description continues: Principal glazing within overlooks a small green in front of the house, while a well-sized private courtyard garden lies to the side. The current custodian is artist Tod Hanson, who has transformed two of the rooms into truly extraordinary art installations, using the influence of the architecture to inform the optics of the works.” The house - named Waxwing - is understood to have been built around  for a merchant interested in the port and nearby River Tweed. Waxwing backs directly onto the walls of the coastal town, allowing for river views. According to Inigoaposs sale description, “beautul joinery can be found in abundance inside the property with the cupboards and much of the architectural hardware being original. The house includes an impressive hall with large flagstones underfoot, which the agents write are wonderfully patinated from the thousands of footsteps it has received since its original purpose as an external passage through to the city wall. A large first-floor room that runs the width of the building is now said to form the pinnacle of Tod’s installation. Believed to have once been the drawing-room in days gone by, itaposs said that this space could easily be ed to its original use as a drawing-room while serving just as well as the main bedroom. The description reads: “Ascending another level leads to two generously proportioned bedrooms. One of these contains another of Tod’s brilliant installations, focusing on a frame-grid mot that directly interacts with the structure of the room.” Tod, who is said to be painting his home to reflect the outside world, has a number of permanent installations showing in London, with one seven-story mural currently being displayed at the LSE.

Alix Byrne, who lives in a one-bedroom apartment with her partner Andrew, was struggling like many of us to keep on top of her laundry. Despite having numerous clothes airers, she couldnapost find space to hang all of her clothes to dry. But one day while she was putting her bedding out to dry, the -year-old had a eureka moment. As she covered the clothes horse with the bedsheet, placing it near the radiator, she found that the sheet had created a pocket of hot air, drying the clothes underneath within just two hours. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. It was kind of a eureka moment,” Alix, a postwoman, said. I was trying to find where  to hang the bed sheet to dry, apart from over the kitchen door which ends up smelling of whatever you’re cooking. I usually keep my clothes frame by the radiator, especially in winter and I just thought aposwhy not throw the bedsheet over the frame, tuck the ends behind the radiator and under the stands then the hot air from the radiator will dry my clothes in hours.apos I stay in a small, cosy, one bed flat with my partner and we always have two clothes frames at once as we have busy lestyles and go through a lot of washings which takes up too much space.  We have a tumble dryer but to be honest, it costs far too much and doesn’t really leave your clothes smelling the best. I think the reason this hack would benefit people is it saves money on tumble drying. You probably have the heating on anyway as it’s January. It saves up space as your clothes would be dry within hours and the clothes horse can be packed away again and into the cupboard. Instead of the usual  hours and your clothes are still damp – then low and behold, it’s time for another washing! It doesn’t have to be a never-ending cycle anymore.Alix shared the incredible results on Facebook, where her post racked up more than , likes.Thousands of users took to the comments section to share their own experiences and tips. One person said: Done this for years it’s actually brilliant all my clothes dry so quick! Another wrote: Definitely giving this a go, takes about three days to dry an airer full of washing. A third commented: Well this looks like a bloody game changer! Someone  said: “Omg why haven’t I saw this before, constantly wondering how to dry washing faster with all radiators being full, dryer full and clothes horse full. [sic] Alix also shared a few top tips to maximise results. She said: People askdampness occurs, but I use a double bed sheet over a king sheet so it’s not totally covering the whole clothes frame and there’s still gaps for the air to escape and heat the room up – win win! If you’re worried about damp, crack a window slightly or have a dehumidier nearby. People have also askedthis can cause fires but I don’t think a radiator is hot enough,you’re that worried just turn it down on a low heat for longer and keep an eye on it. I’ve found on a medium-high setting, they were dry within - hours and - on low give or take. My clothes also still smell fresh of the fabric conditioner because they dried so quick.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

And for the privilege, Sandraaposs new tenant would have to pay her £ a month - but at least theyaposd get a view of the starry sky. What do you think of Sandraaposs advert  Let us know in the comments...The -year-old woman said that she would like to live with someone  and reduce my rent bit. She added: Thataposs why I came up with the idea of the tent. She also said that she wants to offer somebody the opportunity to live in Zurich on the cheap, adding: In this city, the situation for those looking for a flat is very dficult. Finding an affordable room to rent is almost impossible. Sandra says that she has already received interest from ious parties, saying: Itaposs mostly students who think the idea is cool. Many have written that it is something dferent. Sandra, however, added: I realise that it might be a bit dficult to find a tenant in the middle of winter. Especially since the balcony is not covered.

Lawyer Beat Rohrer, however, is quoted in local media as saying that it is not possible to simply offer a tent on the balcony as a living space, although in principle, it is not strictly forbidden. But first, some basic conditions that are regulated by Swiss law need to be met.There is a right to lighting as well as a right to protection from noise and fire, andthe tent remains in place for a longer period of time, approval from the local building permit authority would also be required.The lawyer also stated that the landlordaposs consent is also required.

The object, first discovered by an Australian university student working on his undergraduate thesis, has been observed to release a huge burst of radio energy for a whole minute every  minutes. The observation is known as a “transient” – which refers to an object that periodically releases brief flashes of radio signals, asit is switching on and off in space. Objects that pulse energy in the Universe are often documented, but researchers say an object that turns on for a full minute is highly unusual.  Natasha Hurley-Walker, who led the team at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Researchat Curtin University, described the discovery as “spooky”. [It] was appearing and disappearing over a few hours during our observations,” she said. “That was completely unexpected. It was kind of spooky for an astronomer because thereaposs nothing known in the sky that does that.”  The team is now working to understand what they have found but ICRAR said they were able to establish that the object is incredibly bright and has an extremely strong magnetic field. Scientists believe the object could be a neutron star or a white dwarf – a term used for the remnants of a collapsed star. More detections will tell astronomers whether this was a rare one-off event or a vast new population weaposd never noticed before, Dr Hurley-Walker said.  Iaposm looking forward to understanding this object and then extending the search to find more.” Curtin University Honours student Tyrone O’Doherty discovered the mysterious object using the Murchison Widefield Array telescope in outback Western Australia – and a new technique he developed.  He said: “It’s exciting that the source I identied last year has turned out to be such a peculiar object.” The findings have been published in the Nature journal.

The -year-old, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, had been diagnosed with endometriosis – a debilitating condition that causes uterine tissue to grow outside the uterus – at just . At the time, doctors had warned this could make becoming a mum almost impossible.Adding to this concern, fertility tests revealed her egg reserve was extremely low for her age. The combination of these two factors prompted Rebecca to make the drastic decision to undergo IVF, with the help of a sperm donor back in August .And after seven emotional months of appointments, injections, and heartache, she was over the moon after discovering she was pregnant in March  - with the mum welcoming her little bundle of joy Noah in November last year. The retail worker described “mum le” as being “amazing”. “I do everything myself and have a routine, it’s tiring but great and I wouldn’t change it for the world,” she said. “I have absolutely no regrets, I would do it again in a heartbeat. “Noah is everything I ever dreamed of and he makes my le complete. Some days are easier than others, but I have eased into mum le quite smoothly. I’ve had people tell me I’m selfish because iaposve brought a child into the world without a father. But I have so much support around me from family and friends, this little guy is so incredibly loved. “Don’t get me wrong, I’d love a partner and hope to find someone in the future. But I’m very independent, so being a single mum wasn’t something that scared me. Rebeccaaposs journey to motherhood was paved with dficulties and heartache, with the mum having been devastated by the news that she may never have been able to get pregnant. She said: “I’d always wanted to be a mum and always dreamed of having a family. But after being diagnosed with endometriosis as a teenager, I knew it might be a struggle to fall pregnant naturally. “In , my ex-boyfriend and I broke up. It was hard, because I’d already started thinking about our future and the possibility of having kids. “When that was no longer an option, I decided to check my fertility just to make sure it would still be possible in the future. “It came back that my egg count was abnormally low for a woman my age. I was deemed infertile by a specialist and was told there was no way I could naturally fall pregnant. “This was heartbreaking, after the appointment I just hopped back into my car and cried my eyes out. The fertility specialist said my first option was to have my eggs retrieved and frozen, which would mean I could wait until I’d found a partner.  “But this could severely compromise the quality of the eggs and there was a chance they could not be used in the future. “My other option was to start the process of IVF straight away with the help of a sperm donor. After a lot of thought, I knew this was my best chance to become a mother.” With her window of opportunity to have a baby getting smaller, Rebecca knew time was of the essence. And with her dream of starting a family close to her heart, she decided to become a single mum with the help of a sperm donor. She said: “I talked to my family and friends about it. I had some people tell me that I should wait until I find a partner and that being a single mum would be too hard. “But I knew that could take another five or even ten years to get to that point, and I only had very little time left. So, I decided to go ahead and become a single mum with the help of a sperm donor.  “There were  donors to pick from and we got it down to . From there we got it down again to three donors, and finally to the one. “I started in February  and ended up with four eggs. Sadly, one died on the first day, so we had three that turned into embryos. “Another one died, so then I only had two left. Then an hour before my transfer, I was told one of my embryos had died. I only had one left but luckily it was doing very well.” Rebecca said all her hopes were wrapped up in her last embryo and was prepared for the possibility that it might not work. Thankfully, the transfer was a success and a blood test confirmed she was pregnant two weeks later. And in November , her son Noah was born after  hours of labour, weighing lbs.  “If any woman is thinking about having a child through sperm donation, I would say do it. We don’t need a man to help raise children or be a certain age, she added. Noah is such a cheeky baby, he is very clever and just like his mummy. “I’m so happy with my choice and love my son more than anything.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Gold CoastPregnancySingle mumStarting a familyTeenagersTeenage pregnancyIVFSperm donationFertility\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tattoo advocate DeeDee Villegasfrom Cebu, Philippines, first got into tattoo culture due to peer pressure. She got her undergraduate degree from the University of San Carlos in Bachelor of Fine Arts where the student population expressed their iniduality in extremes. DeeDeeaposs first tattoo was a tribal design on her neck of no special signicance. However, she got entrenched in the culture when she discovered the rich historical signicance and import tattoos had in the Philippines and worldwide. Over the last  years, DeeDee has spent over , pesostattooing -% of her body including her eyeballs. Her tattoos have taken over  hours to complete and cover her entire body except for her stomach and legs. In addition to her tattoos, which DeeDee considers as one continuing interconnected work of art she also has  facial piercings. Being a heavily modied, gay, non-binary person in the Philippines comes with undeniable challenges. DeeDee was once exorcised of the devil on public transport by a priest and frequently has people quote bible quotes at her for her or their own aposprotectionapos. I got my first tattoo during my emo goth college phase, mainly due to peer pressure, says DeeDee. At first it was a fashion stance and later it evolved into an outlet for me.  When I felt extreme emotion or suffered from bouts of depression or anxiety tattoos became my coping mechanism. It did not last very long, and I underwent rehab to overcome my depression, but tattoos became a permanent form of expression for me. I got permanently invested in them when I did a course on art appreciation and learnt the rich historical signicance of tattoos. However, being a heavily modied, gay, non-binary person in the Philippines comes with undeniable challenges. I have spent my adult le advocating against tattoo discrimination and things have slowly gotten better however, that is not always the case. On one memorable occasion, I had just boarded the public bus in the Philippines, when a priest on board saw me, raised his hands and started chanting. He was trying to exorcise the devil from me and as we were in a bus full of passengers it caused quite a scene. DeeDee claims the Philippines have evolved in terms of accepting heavily modied as well as LGBTQ members over the years. In the Philippines, it is a challenge still, I am to this day regularly verbally abused on the street, she says. However, there is a change noticeable, there are careers that the heavily modied can apply for and thrive in. There was a time when you would not get a face-to-face interview with a visible tattoo and that has changed. There had been incidents where it was dficult to get government IDaposs or apply for the police force. Itaposs tolerated here, but I wouldnapost say that itaposs fully accepted, just as homosexuality is tolerated but not accepted. It is dficult as the Philippines are mostly Catholic conservative population. The stigma stems from the fact that once you are tattooed youaposre either a drug addict or from prison. DeeDee believes social media has been the greatest influencing medium in the journey of heavily modied iniduals being accepted in Philippine society. I havefollowers on TikTok,followers on Facebook andfollowers on Instagram, she says.My social media presence has become so much so that people recognise me on the streets now. I believe the internet and western influence has led to increased acceptance of the modied community in the Philippines.  However, the internet still being the internet I get my fair share of hate on it. I would say % of the comments I receive are positive, however, I do have people quoting bible verses at me. Or negative or nasty comments about me, my parents, siblings, friends etc. Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Fine ArtsUniversity of San CarlosMental healthPublic transportTattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

It#s so heartening to experience the children#s energy, enthusiasm and awe when learning about whales and dolphins.Our sessions are so important as they spark passion and interest in the local environment and encourage conversations about the actions that we can all take to help protect it, now and in the future.Players of People#s Postcode Lottery have supported the charity, raising £, since  to support the development and delivery of new and immersive learning experiences that bring the marine environment to le for children in coastal communities.Our latest creative project, funded by People#s Postcode Trust and Sea-Changers, has been to launch the best of their education sessions online, working with schools and home educators across Scotland and England.Based around the trust#s research expeditions, these digital sessions introduce the amazing ersity of whales, dolphins and sharks in Scotland and give children a glimpse into what it is like to work at sea, studying and protecting ocean giants.Prior to the pandemic, every year school groups would join the charity#s crew on board their research vessel, Silurian, as she was temporarily transformed into a floating classroom.The famous yacht has now visited communities on most of the larger Hebridean islands including Mull, Skye, Islay, Lewis, Harris, Uist, Barra, Coll, Tiree and the Small Isles as well as some of the largest towns along Scotland#s west coast, such as Oban, Mallaig and Ullapool.Raising awareness and aspirations for green careers features at the centre of the charity#s education strategy.Each year the trust runs dedicated research expeditions for - and -year-olds on board Silurian.These young adults gain hands-on experience monitoring marine le, including collecting data as part of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust long-term citizen science project, which informs local and national conservation efforts.Anyone can help the charity monitor marine le, by reporting their sightings of cetaceans – the collective name for whales, dolphins and porpoises – and basking sharks online.The trust also offers guided field trips for schools, so that younger children can take part and experience the thrill of spotting seabirds and marine mammals from land.Local wildle is not only amazing to see, but each species also has an important biological role to play.By protecting whales and giving marine ecosystems the chance to recover, we can improve the health and resilience of our seas and in turn the climate and planet for us all.We#re really proud to support the next generation of ocean ambassadors and look forward to when Silurian can once again become a floating classroom and set sail for island schools.In the meantime, teachers or home educators keen to take part in our online sessions are encouraged to get in touch by emailing info@hwdt.org"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 7 2022","story":"He followed a very dferent path.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

The changes would mean a am opening on Saturday, with a closure of pm, while Sunday would retain its opening time but shut at .pm.Mr MacAskill said: “As a regular user of the station, I share the views of RMT.“It’s a retrograde step.“The staff are helpful and essential, evenI’m often just picking up tickets from a machine.“It’s only Dunbar as others are unmanned but it’s a major station for the county.”Paul McLennan, who is East Lothian’s MSP as well as a councillor for the Dunbar and East Linton ward, encouraged people to take part in the consultation.He said: “Dunbar residents have less than three weeks to make their views known on the proposed changes to the ticket office opening times.“The changes to opening times at the weekends are the most signicant and will likely impact residents who travel to Edinburgh from Dunbar socially in the evening.“Last year, the community response from Dunbar residents was a driving force in the delaying of the proposed changes to rail services in East Lothian as part of the new East Coast Mainline timetable.”ScotRail offered a breakdown on how people purchased their tickets.More than  ticket vending machines have been installed across the country, with more than a quarter of all ticket sales coming through the machines.Internet access also accounts for about  per cent, with the number of people using ticket offices dropping from  per cent in  to  per cent in .According to ScotRail, the proposed changes would impact on  stations across the country.A spokesperson said: “Some locations may see minor changes whilst other locations may see reduced opening hours to align with customer usage.

We face a constant battle against time and the elements.”HES admitted it remained a massive challenge to save the historic sites.“We are taking proactive action now to assess the nature and scale of the immediate challenge and to explore a range of solutions and options,” Dr Mitchell said.“It is inevitable our approach to protecting historic buildings will have to change we need to reimagine how we manage these historic and much-loved places.”Paul McLennan, MSP for East Lothian, said: “I’m disappointed to see the sites in East Lothian closed for a period of time but understand the reason why.“The closure of the sites, along with the cancellation of the airshow, will have an impact on the tourism industry in East Lothian.“I will be undertaking a tour of East Lothians tourist attractions in the next few months to see what support I can bring to them.”Martin Whitfield, MSP for South Scotland, added: “Clearly, it’s disappointing that these important local sites look set to be closed or subject to restricted access for some time.“They are important contributors to our local heritage, tourism and the economy, attracting thousands of visitors each year. However, the safety of staff and the public must be the priority and closures are understandableremedial works have to be completed to make the buildings safe.“That said, nobody will want to see these sites closed to the public any longer than absolutely necessary.“Therefore,it’s determined that additional resources are required to complete the work, I’ll be calling for the Scottish Government to step in and provide more funding.”Local businesses have also been affected due to the closures, with guests being left disappointed to find the sites closed or choosing not to visit at all.Christopher Hansen, co-owner of The Open Arms Hotel in Dirleton, said: “We do have a lot of people askthe castle is open I’m not sure it’s put people off coming to stay but sometimes people aren’t aware that it’s

a sixth waste receptacle to households late last year as it looked to improve kerbside collections.And at a meeting of the council’s cabinet on Wednesday, its head of infrastructure Tom Reid hailed the new service as a success.He told the cabinet that although figures were still not available to compare the impact of the additional collection, the council was producing “industry-leading” material.He said: “While other local authorities are having to pay to have recycling waste separated, we are not.”The council introduced white weighted bags to homes for them to “wash and squash” plastic bottles, tins and cartons into as it increased collections in November.The bags join a food waste caddy, green household waste bin, brown garden waste bin, a blue box for paper and card, and a green or black box for glass bottles and jars.Mr Reid acknowledged that some teething problems had been encountered when the new bags were first introduced, along with new weekly collections, due to the impacts of Brexit and Covid.However, he said that they had quickly resolved issues and the service was now working well, although he said figures for the new recycling service would be unlikely to be available until the end of the financial year.The East Lothian system sees vehicles, adapted to empty the dferent receptacles into separate compartments, introduced to allow more regular kerbside collection and cutting the separation work needed once the rubbish is taken back to centres.Most other local authorities collect dferent recycling materials in one wheelie bin or similar receptacle, leading to more separating work being needed and risking the materials, which can be sold to private firms, being less “clean”.Mr Reid’s comments were made as part of an annual report into the council’s ongoing climate change strategy.It set out a number of key achievements in its annual review, including successfully claiming £.m of Scottish Government funding for energy efficiency schemes, including installing wall insulation and air source heat pumps in areas of fuel poverty and upgrading  central heating systems.A vehicle to grid trial, which sees energy from an electric car battery pushed back into the National Grid when not being used, is also under way at the council’s Penston House base, as well as the installation of  new electric vehicle chargers, taking the number publicly available in the county up to .Councillor Norman Hampshire, council leader, said that the report showed the work which was being done to meet climate targets in East Lothian.He said: “This annual update provides a clear indication of East Lothian Council’s progress as an organisation and employer to reduce its carbon footprint and also identies actions and achievements within our local communities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sigrid-tickets-edinburgh-go-presale-today---get","story":"Sigrid has risen through the charts in the past few years with her standout single Don’t Kill my Vibe and

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion.

Part of Saudi Vision , a masterplan to reshape the economy, tourism presents a vital new source of revenue.Although developments are happening across the country, the biggest hopes are pinned on AlUla, one of the oldest cities in the Arabian Peninsula, located in the north west of the Kingdom.Blessed with fertile soils and an oasis of natural springs, the traditional date-growing region and commercial centre was a key stop along ancient intercontinental incense and spice-trading routes, linking India and Arabia with the Mediterranean and the Levant.The star attraction is Hegra, a collection of around  grandiose burial tombs carved into rocky outcrops rising from the desert. Declared a Unesco World Heritage Site in , its one of the best examples of Nabataean culture, drawing comparisons with Jordans historical gem, Petra.Travelling in a vintage x, we drive through the sprawling, dusty site, admiring towering facades decorated with reliefs of eagles, snakes and stairways to heaven. Encasing the portals, a honeycomb lattice of rock appears to have been melted by the sun like a giant waxy candle.Most tombs belonged to women - indicating females enjoyed an elevated status in Nabataean society - a point poignantly stressed by our local guides.Other archaeological sites of interest in AlUla include the ruins of Dadan, dating back roughly to the first millennium BC, and Jabal Ikmah, an open-air library of ledgers and notes etched into the rocks. Described by our guide as \"the original Twitter\", it was a resting place for weary travellers seeking shade and the refreshment of a waterfall that once flowed, a forum for discussion and  to broadcast thoughts.Less than % of the area has been excavated, making it a living, breathing Indiana Jones adventure for archaeologists like Jerome Rohmer, who have been invited to conduct major digs.\"Ive worked in Syria and Jordan before, but this is completely fresh. Every time we find something, we see science moving forward.\"Jerome is one of several European talents employed in Saudis  mission, joining names like A-list chef Jason Atherton, who has opened Maraya Social in the Ashar Valley, km from Hegra.\"Ive been coming to the Middle East for  years and I didnt know natural beauty like this existed in this area,\" he says, when we meet at the restaurant which occupies the rooftop of the worlds largest mirrored building, reflecting a dramatic landscape of glowing red canyons.The glass conference hall is close to several of AlUlas new luxury hotels. Banyan Tree, Aman and Abercrombie  Kent all have projects in the pipeline, while experiential hotel group Habitas have already opened their -room property, spread across standalone villas.After dark, the fashionable propertys pool is lit up, while music pumps from speakers and canapes and cocktails are served on glitzy platters, making it feel more like a trendy St Tropez enclave than a hotel in a country governed by Islamic law. The missing ingredient is alcohol, although hoteliers are confident rules will be relaxed for foreign visitors in resorts.Change is, indeed, happening at a pace. By the end of , Philip Jones, chief destination marketing officer for the Royal Commission for AlUla, estimates there will be , hotel rooms available - although any development will be carefully controlled. This wont, he insists, be another Dubai.A project to plant . million palm trees is already underway, while oryx and gazelles have been rewilded in the Sharaan Nature Reserve, an area ear-marked for safari-style holidays. Its hoped an Arabian leopard reintroduction will follow.Its a carefully and expertly orchestrated plan. But one part of the process Saudi Arabia cant control is whether people will actually come.\"Our biggest challenge is the perception of Saudi Arabia, outside of its borders,\" admits Philip, acknowledging widespread international scepticism linked to reported human rights abuses. But he urges people to see beyond affairs of state. \"There are a lot of places in the world Ive visited that I dont necessarily embrace their politics. Besides, we have an opportunity and an obligation to help [Saudi Arabia] transition to become a more progressive country.\"One particularly controversial topic is the treatment of women.Mashail Makki, one of Saudi Arabias first female guides, shares her thoughts with me on a tour of the AlUla Old Town, where a citadel dating back to the th century has been restored as an open-air museum, and there are plans to reverse rural depopulation by enticing farmers back to the area.\"They say we dont have freedoms,\" she complains. \"But nobody ever asks us, so how would they know \" No-one forces her to wear a hijab, she insists. She simply enjoys the freedom of going out incognito.Admittedly, hers is only one voice, and while AlUla offers a fascinating window on ancient Arabia, getting a grip on the present is much harder.But does that really matter when there are so many treasures to unearth from the past Saudi is ready to share her secrets, andthe stars are aligning, its very tempting to join the caravan.How to plan your tripAbercrombie  Kentoffers seven nights on their Saudi Arabia: Desert Kingdoms Escorted Tour from £,pp .

These schemes include the Albano Machado and Rio dos Índios projects and the Tambopata-Bahuaja bioersity reserve in Peru.However, Loganair recognises the importance of supporting local communities on their own path to carbon zero, which is facilitated via the GreenSkies Community fund.The fund will be released in three instalments of £,, with applicants able to access a maximum grant of £, per project. The application deadline for the first instalment is st January, .The initiative is open to communities and will help to establish renewable energy projects such as small-scale wind systems, solar , small-scale hydro power, and air source heat pumps. It is not available for funding research or feasibility studies.Jonathan Hinkles, CEO, Loganair, said: “We’ve made our position clear. The transport industry as a whole has a duty to address and reduce emissions from every form of travel, and it’s our responsibility as the UK’s largest regional airline to lead the way.“Our GreenSkies Community Fund will support local renewables projects that not only tackle carbon emissions but also benefit communities by providing power that reduces energy bills. As an airline we are involved in some incredibly exciting and innovative initiatives to decarbonise aviation and we hope our GreenSkies Community Fund will encourage the same pioneering spirit in communities across Scotland.”Readers are reminded that the GreenSkies Community Fund is now open, should you have a project you wish to apply for, but the deadline for the first instalment is approaching soon.

It is a long-term programme consisting of several inidual workstreams, of which the remote towers element is one.#The financial investment in the programme thus far provides a stable  to move forward with the essential modernisation of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands.#The investment is already benefiting the organisation and providing resilience through the recruitment of seven Ab-initio stafffor the modernisation programme and who are supporting operations for Sumburgh, Dundee, Wick and Kirkwall airports.#HIAL has also invested further in the training of our air traffic colleagues by purchasing an air traffic simulator and recruiting an in-house training team, who are currently located at New Century House.#HIAL add that they are #hopeful# of reaching an agreement with Prospect when the HIAL board meet this week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We need to be careful that the national messaging, which currently sits well within larger city areas, does not impact negatively here.“The simple solution is for everyone to maintain the good practices in place that have kept many of us safe to this point. They include the wearing of masks, distancing, sanitising and keeping up the regular lateral flow testing and logging the results online whether positive or negative which help our colleagues in Public Health keep on top of potential community transmission.”The Scottish Government has announced new guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday, January .This will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.Businesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.The requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings # like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties # will be reduced from m to m from January .Face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.OLECG vice-chair and the council’s interim executive director of environmental, property  IT services, Hayley Green, said: “Our business continuity plans are holding up but there remains a fragility and we do not want to react in a manner that could potentially risk services, particularly frontline essential services, by implementing change too quickly # we must maintain a steady as we go approach. We do not expect any signicant changes in the meantime in terms of how we are operating.“We will consider the new guidance carefully and make decisions based on the safety of all and the resilience of our operations.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a few days in the field, I’ll probably be a bit sore. But, yeah, I really want to work on it.”Banton counts World Cup-winning Buttler among his role models and the similarities between the pair are obvious, having come through the same set-up at Somerset while they are both renowned for their clean and powerful striking.⃣⃣ off just ⃣⃣ for Bants! 👏Match Centre: https:t.co JHAFWphCJ🏝 #WIvENG 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 | @TBanton pic BvAscgEgx— England CricketJanuary , Askedhe is looking to follow Buttler’s pathway, Banton said: “It has to be. He’s probably the best in the world.“I’m quite good mates with Jos and it’s weird because I look up to him, now I get to play with him and it’s awesome. Definitely, I want to follow in his footsteps.”Regarded as one of England’s biggest prospects, Banton has also earned comparisons with Kevin Pietersen but the former England batter was left unimpressed after watching the youngster during a Hundred match last August.In his role as a Sky pundit, Pietersen opined Banton was “wasting” his talent, adding: “He needs to rework the way he goes about his batting. There is a big psychological change that needs to happen there.”Banton was stung by the remarks but a phone call with Pietersen the following day smoothed matters over.\" data-title\"Australia v England –   Ashes Series – First Test – Day One – The Gabba\" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"Jason O’Brien\" data-usage-terms\"Editorial use only.

I remember I was sat there after The Hundred game and hearing him talk on Sky while I was eating and then I called him the next day and he kind of explained a bit more about what he meant.“There’s good and bad things being said about every player all the time, more often than not it’s bad. It’s kind of the sport we’re in so you’ve just got to get on with it.”Banton has previously spoken about the dficulties of spending time in Covid bubbles, whether with England or in franchise teams, so will skip the Pakistan Super League and Indian Premier League to focus on the county season.England’s whistle-stop white-ball tour of the Caribbean permits players to eat outside at some restaurants and take part in golf, a far cry from the strict and claustrophobic restrictions Banton has had to adjust to in the last two years.He added: “After a time, it just takes its toll.

He loves everything about him.“He has a collection of toy motorcycles that are his ‘Joe Dangers’ every motorcycle we see on the street is ‘Joe Danger’.“One of the first things I hear everyday when I walk in the door after a long day at work is ‘Come on, daddy, let’s go play Joe Danger!’“Just being able to say that sentence is a MASSIVE deal for a child with autism.”Jack also, his father wrote, used the game as a coping mechanism, as they used the game as a reward for him when he got through stressful and dficult situations.In the letter, he asks the developersthey can bring the game back online.It reads: “I don’t even knowit’s something that would be possible, or,possible, how much time and effort would have to be put into getting Joe back up and runningwith the new versions of iOS, but it would mean the world to at least one little boy.”A secret shame of ours is that the success of No Man’s Sky left our first game Joe Danger unloved. Sadly since iOS culled older games it no longer worked on latest Apple devices 😭This mail broke our hearts and made us want to set things right 💔 pic OzyTjMUK— Sean MurrayJanuary , Writing on Twitter, Mr Murray said the correspondence “broke our hearts”, adding: “As game devs it’s so easy to underestimate the impact even your smallest games can have.”He said the team had undertaken a “hobby project” to bring the game back online, “slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of technology changes”.The updated versions of Joe Danger and Joe Danger Infinity went on sale in Apple’s App Store on Thursday for £. each or £. for both.“It’s sad that games slowly rot and many disappear,” Mr Murray tweeted.“Hopefully this gives Joe the happy le he deserves.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

We went one mile offshore of Ocean City, Maryland and we threw in the bottle.We predicted, me and Wayne, that the bottle would go into the Gulf Stream.”Little did the pair think, that their bottle would make a voyage over two years and , miles across the Atlantic ocean, to be discovered in Ireland.Sadly, Sasha’s friend Wayne died in August  at the age of , but having Rita and Ciaran reach out to the teen has brought back great memories of his time with his favourite fishing partner. Wayne was a good fishing buddy to be around with,” he said.Sasha’s father, Vlad, who is originally from Belarus, said that Wayne “spent a lot of time with Sasha” and that “they became very good friends”.He also explained that the family has set up a fundraising page to help collect money for a flight to Ireland, so that Sasha can meet Rita and Ciaran, and see first hand where his bottle ended up in the north west of the island. Rita told the Belfastthat initially, although Sasha’s letter included a phone number, when she and Ciaran tried to call it, it seemed to be disconnected.They eventually found Sasha and his family through the help of a reporter at an Ocean City newspaper called The Dispatch, who had a friend that knew Sasha’s parents. They then contacted each other through Facebook.“We#re so excited about it. It’s so amazing really, to think that it made that long journey,” added Rita, and said that lots of family and friends in Belfast are “excited to hopefully meet Sasha some day soon. We already have a -year-old west Belfast girl, a cousin, who wants to write to him. It’s such tough times for people, so it’s such a lovely human story.

The fact that they have blocked it from getting onto the paper speaks to this wider issue about not recognising that unionists do not consent to the arrangements that the protocol have put in place.Mr Givan was speaking after he and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill had a meeting with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is leading the negotiations with the EU.On the prospect of Edwin Poots taking unilateral action to halt the port checks, Michelle O#Neill said: Edwin Poots himself has clearly said in the Assembly chamber that he has a legal responsibility in which to administer the checks at the ports, that remains the case today.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up There#s also very clear Executive policy that it is the Daera department, his department, that must administer those checks. So, he is the minister responsible.So, instead of electioneering and stunt politics he should get on with doing his job.Edwin Poots has played this card before, he#s played this hand before and he#s failed. It#s very, very clear, we have very consistently clear attorney general advice.He himself has repeated that claim in the Assembly chamber that he has the legal responsibility to deliver the checks at the ports, as per the Withdrawal Agreement.He was designated by the Executive by all ministers agreed that he was the minister responsible to bring that forward. So, that#s why this is only stunt politics.Mr Givan said he thought not allowing the issue to go to the Executive was a “mistake” by Sinn Fein.Those checks to continue requires the Executive to agree that - that#s why we believe that the checks continuing would be unlawful,” he added.That requires Edwin Poots as the minister to act in a way that will resolve that issue and Edwin Poots is going to act.So, the fact that it#s not on the agenda does not change the legal parameters by which Edwin Poots as a minister has to discharge his duties and he will be taking action.That is something that the DUP have said that we were going to do and we are going to do that.The First Minister also confirmed civil servants would be obliged to follow any instruction from Mr Poots regarding the halting of checks.It#s a ministerial instruction to the civil service, he said.It#s politicians who are elected, they have a democratic mandate, civil servants do not have a democratic mandate to take these decisions and, absolutely, civil servants will have to follow the democratic ministerial instruction of their minister.”It comes after Mr Givan had earlier suggested  February  would be a a signicant date for progress in negotiations with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol..He said there has to be progress on negotiations to remove the barriers to trade caused by the post-Brexit checks “imminently”.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has previously warned he would potentially pull ministers out of Stormontprogress is not made.Mr Givan said: In that update Liz Truss has indicated that she is making progress with the European Union and obviously February  is a very signicant date in terms of what progress will have been made or not made.This the deadline that the UK Government are saying is a signicant date now because the Joint Working Committee is going to be meeting.I pressed the Foreign Secretary about the need to take action in the absence of there being progress and an agreed outcome with the European Union.The Foreign Secretary indicated that the UK Government does stand ready to take action, she mentioned the use of Article , but she prefers to get an agreed position with the European Union.I have emphasised the absolute critical nature of that progress being made, because the protocol is causing instability to these institutions, it is damaging our economy and this is having a real impact on Northern Ireland.So, we need to see that progress, we need to see that imminently and we also need to see action taken by the UK Governmentthere isn#t an agreed outcome.The protocol was negotiated to avoid a hard border with Ireland, by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU#s single market for goods.Unionists have consistently been pressuring for it to be scrapped because of the trade barriers it has created on products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.The First Minister’s party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson warned he could not guarantee Mr Givan would still be in position in the coming days with the DUP demanding changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol.Sir Jeffrey has repeatedly threatened to withdraw ministers from the powersharing Executive - a move that could collapse devolution -major changes to the Irish Sea border trading arrangements are not secured.Related topicsBrandon LewisPaul GivanMost ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenNightclubs buzzing with excitement again after ‘grim’ months of closureDUP to halt Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports, as Sinn Fein accuse party of ‘stunt politics’John Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Top VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly -

The revival of student hotspots have been particularly welcomed, especially by Belfast’s dense university-attending population.Speaking just ahead of opening the doors last night, Jordan Heaney — bar supervisor at the Limelight — said he was excited for the club’s .Despite it being #dry January# he expected the Limelight to be as busy as ever due to its popularity with students and the fact that it has been closed for so long.

Dancing and indoor standing events in general are also now able to resume, and while Covid certication passports are no longer legally required in bars, restaurants and cinemas, they are still needed to gain access to a club .While a lot of venues have opted to postpone their grand reopening until the weekend, restrictions officially eased for nightclubs as of noon yesterday, and many business owners throughout Northern Ireland were champing at the bit to get punters back through the doors as quickly as possible.In Belfast, Northern Ireland’s most popular LGBT+ venue, Kremlin kicked the night off at pm with resident DJ Ryan A, and the city centre’s Thompson’s Garage reopened at pm with their trademark hip hop and urban-themed Funkarama night.Outside Thompson’s, three friends — Adam, Caomhan, Ruairi— were more than ready to be back out #for good#. For Adam, it has been too long since he was in a nightclub with no restrictions. I was in Thompson#s two weeks ago, but it was table service and no dancing. I#d say last time I was in a full-on club was my secondyear, so two years ago.Despite clubs opening briefly back in October, the lads felt it #didn#t feel right to go but find that this time around, things seem more definitive.It felt like you were always waiting to go back into lockdown before, Adam added. But now it feels like you#re more allowed to go out.Caomhan said that the minute they heard last week that nightclubs would be reopening again, his instant reaction was: Right Wednesday night, let#s get out.Ruairi graduated from Queen#s University Belfast in December, but said he is planning to still make the most of his student party le now, adding: I missed my entire final year because of Covid.My entire final year, everything was closed. It was grim!Joe Dougan promotes clubs and events, including Shine Belfast, which owns the Limelight building. It is one of the city’s most renowned concert venues and had been restricted to comedy gigs and limited bar table service for long periods at a time during the pandemic. The nightclub itself has been closed for  weeks over the past two years, and only fully opened for eight, according to Mr Dougan.At pm last night though, it was clear to see how eager many of the Limelight’s lovers have been for theof its ‘UFO’ night. The ticketed event sold out well in advance of its re-launch.A regular midweek destination for students, UFO offers three rooms of tunes, two beer gardens and “insane production”.“Hopefully this is the end of the restrictions and we can get back to planning and back to business,” said Mr Dougan.He said he hopes that that an Executive meeting on February  will remove mandatory Covid certication in all settings, to bring nightclubs and other venues into line with the rest of hospitality. “But it’s going to take a long time to fully recover from the damage for many sectors including hospitality, retail and travel,” he added.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeQueen’s UniversityMore On The Executive Office PremiumUK won’t step inDUP orders halt to Brexit checks at ports, says Foreign Secretary Liz TrussHouseholders face a huge squeeze on energy budgets... and there may be no end in sightTribute: Stormont leaders issue message of tolerance for Holocaust Memorial Day PremiumTranslink cuts put over , bus and rail services at risk PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekMost ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesNightclubs buzzing with excitement again after ‘grim’ months of closureBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenDUP to halt Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports, as Sinn Fein accuse party of ‘stunt politics’John Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Top VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo - Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarks on Bloody SundayLatest Northern Ireland‘Don’t refuse to let us in’: PSNI share photo of destroyed door after forcing entry to detain suspectFirst man shot on Bloody Sunday: ‘I am alive, I can talk… but the families, they have been through hell’First man shot on Bloody Sunday: ‘I am alive, I can talk… but the families, they have been through hell’Businesses in Northern Ireland ‘hopeful’ of UK-EU deal after meeting TrussAmerican boy hopes to meet couple who found his message in a bottle on Donegal beachLatestDeveloper brings back iPhone game after request from parent of child with autismUK won’t step inDUP orders halt to Brexit checks at ports, says Foreign Secretary Liz TrussSurvivors light candles in London to mark Holocaust Memorial DayBarry Cryer wished his grandson the same ‘higgledy-piggledy’ le he hadBiden: Ready for ‘long overdue’ pick of black female justice,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People around the world can see that we’re not prepared to give up. I know some of the families are getting older, and me myself, I could die, you know.“And I have a sister who’s passionate about this campaign and I would hope that she’d carry it on with good health.“That’s the one thing I do worry about, that I don’t make it to see prosecutions, because after that I wouldn’t care.“I just want equality for all those victims, and I mean all over Northern Ireland — equality and to be able to access the law, courts and have your case looked at independently.“Otherwise, the British Government should be taken to The Hague, because successive Governments have covered up those crimes.”The  Saville Report and apology by David Cameron exonerated the victims and vindicated the families’ campaign for justice.The victims, whose reputations were muddied by the Army, Government and sections of the press as “nail bombers and gunmen”, were cleared by the Prime Minister’s admission that the killings were “unjustied and unjustiable”.However, when the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign was launched, families had three clear demands: to have the Widgery Report whitewash overturned and replaced by an independent inquiry to gain a formal acknowledgement of the innocence of all their loved ones, and to prosecute those responsible.The third objective has not been met.Families want prosecutions, but there is a feeling among some that the Saville Inquiry apportioned blame to rogue rank-and-file soldiers while the reputation of military chiefs who directed operations on the day remained untarnished.At Prime Minister’s Questions at Westminster yesterday, Boris Johnson said: “This Sunday marks a tragic day in our history and is one of the darkest days of the Troubles.”He echoed comments made by Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to “learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared, peaceful and prosperous future”.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the Army and the Parachute Regiment to issue a formal apology in the House of Commons yesterday.While he was raising the matter, DUP MP Sammy Wilson could be heard interjecting saying “shame” and “they were protecting the people of Northern Ireland from republicans”.Mr Eastwood said Parachute Regiment flags were flown on the outskirts of Derry and the regiment had rightly condemned the flying of them as a “grossly offensive act”.But, he said, they have yet to apologise and condemn the actions of their soldiers on Bloody Sunday.Mr Lewis said the Government has to accept responsibility for what happened in the past and work to find a way forward.Related topicsColum EastwoodSDLPBrandon LewisBoris JohnsonMore On Colum EastwoodDUP facing ‘public ridicule’ over post-Brexit checks, claims Michelle O’Neill PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekBoris Johnson says Bloody Sunday ‘one of the darkest days’ ahead of Troubles anniversary PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionStruggling DUP will have to claw its way back to topDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight pointsMost ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesNightclubs buzzing with excitement again after ‘grim’ months of closureBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenDUP to halt Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports, as Sinn Fein accuse party of ‘stunt politics’John Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Top VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly -

The department is led by DUP Minister Edwin Poots.Ms Truss, who was visiting Northern Ireland to learn more about the effects of the protocol, said it was “a matter for the NI Executive” to resolve, rather than one for the UK to intervene onthe DUP acts to halt checks. “What I would say is we are working flat out to sort out the issues with the protocol. We’ve having constructive discussions with the EU.“What I’m here to do in Northern Ireland is to really hear from the communities, the businesses, to understand the issues on the ground and make sure the negotiations are as productive as possible.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Everybody knows the protocol is not working. It is creating issues with the flow of trade from GB to Northern Ireland and we need to sort that out.“My number one priority is to make sure that we protect peace in Northern Ireland, that we protect the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“The agreement was on the basis of north south relationships and east west relationships and both of those elements have to be respected and that is why we need to deal with the issues in the protocol.”And she added: “I want to work with all parties in Northern Ireland. I believe there is a deal to be done with the EU. Discussions so far have been constructive. I was in Brussels on Monday meeting Maros Sefcovic, I’m seeing him again next Thursday, our officials are in intensive talks about resolving these issues and what I want to do is make sure we get positive momentum and we move forward. It’s all of our responsibilities to protect the hard-won peace in Northern Ireland and to make it work.” During her visit she met members of the Jewish community, whose supply of kosher foods from Great Britain has been affected by the protocol’s rules.Under the protocol, Northern Ireland is treated as remaining inside the EU single market for goods, in order to avoid a hard border on the island as a result of Brexit.But that has introduced costs and additional checks and affected the availability of some foods here.Ms Truss said the protocol had created problems with sourcing foods for supermarkets as well as becoming an identity issue. She said that on a visit to Green’s Food Fare in Lisburn, she had heard about their dficulties sourcing pies and ready meals from Great Britain.“This is important and an important issue economically and it’s also an important issue from the point of view of identity. We’re all part of the UK, we’re all part of the same market, the same business relationships, the same community, and that is why it’s important that we solve this problem.”She said it was “great”businesses based here could step into the supply gap “but people should have the choice and the choice from businesses in their own country”. It does undermine the constitutional settlementthose goods aren’t able to readily flow.”  She said she hoped there would be “signicant progress” on a deal by February  but that it was slow work.“We are spending time going through all of the details about how to make things work better. That takes time.It’s complex, I visited the port today, I’ve seen the systems and the dferent paperwork being used. This is not easy stuff. So it does take time for our teams to share information, to work it out how to do this better.“I’m very clear this needs to be a shared solution between the UK and EU. We want to protect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the UK, we want the free flow of goods and the EU wants to protect the single market. I understand that that is their aspiration, we need to find the sweet spot that manages to achieve both of those things.“I think that is doable but it does take intense discussions.”She said there was no benefit to considering whether the protocol should have been agreed to at the time. “We now have experience of the protocol having been in place and we should use that experience and the issues that we have seen as a result of the protocol to inform making it better and improving it.”Related topicsNI ProtocolThe Executive OfficeEdwin PootsMaros SefcovicMore On NI Protocol PremiumAlex KaneOpinionResurgent English nationalism has fractured the UnionHouseholders face a huge squeeze on energy budgets... and there may be no end in sight PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekBoris Johnson claims EU enforcing NI Protocol in ‘insane and pettogging way’ PremiumConsiderable unionist support for DUP stance on scrapping ProtocolMost ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesNightclubs buzzing with excitement again after ‘grim’ months of closureBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenDUP to halt Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports, as Sinn Fein accuse party of ‘stunt politics’John Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Top VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly -

He loves everything about him.“He has a collection of toy motorcycles that are his ‘Joe Dangers’ every motorcycle we see on the street is ‘Joe Danger’.“One of the first things I hear everyday when I walk in the door after a long day at work is ‘Come on, daddy, let’s go play Joe Danger!’“Just being able to say that sentence is a MASSIVE deal for a child with autism.”Jack also, his father wrote, used the game as a coping mechanism, as they used the game as a reward for him when he got through stressful and dficult situations.In the letter, he asks the developersthey can bring the game back online.It reads: “I don’t even knowit’s something that would be possible, or,possible, how much time and effort would have to be put into getting Joe back up and runningwith the new versions of iOS, but it would mean the world to at least one little boy.”A secret shame of ours is that the success of No Man’s Sky left our first game Joe Danger unloved. Sadly since iOS culled older games it no longer worked on latest Apple devices 😭This mail broke our hearts and made us want to set things right 💔 pic OzyTjMUK— Sean MurrayJanuary , Writing on Twitter, Mr Murray said the correspondence “broke our hearts”, adding: “As game devs it’s so easy to underestimate the impact even your smallest games can have.”He said the team had undertaken a “hobby project” to bring the game back online, “slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of technology changes”.The updated versions of Joe Danger and Joe Danger Infinity went on sale in Apple’s App Store on Thursday for £. each or £. for both.“It’s sad that games slowly rot and many disappear,” Mr Murray tweeted.“Hopefully this gives Joe the happy le he deserves.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success.

Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend.

It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13410476.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The cocktail bar is all black and gold and it will have a speakeasy vibe to it.ldquoThen there is a rear terrace bar kitchen which is very colourful called Virsquos. It will be much more casual there.Charlottersquos aim for the Elephant Rock Hotel is to make it much more than just a hotel.Luxurious BedroomldquoWe want to run it as a luxury venue where you can go for your dinner and then move into the cocktail bar or the rear bar, her dad continued.ldquoA lot of people have been telling us that the area has been crying out for somewhere like this for a long time and we want to appeal to locals as well as holiday makers.ldquoIt will be a nice environment and a lovely place to go out for something to eat or for a drink.ldquoThe dining area is small but it is all about quality for us. We have the former Head Chef from the Salthouse and the Sous Chef from  at Portstewart Golf Club so the food will be the best quality.With The Open Championship due toto Royal Portrush in , and some of the north#stop tourist attractions on the doorstep, Elephant Rock hopes to become one of the most sought after hotels for golfers and visitors in the months and years to come.ldquoWe are really looking forward to welcoming our first guest on February , added Ian. ldquoWe have some great bookings already including a number of multiple bookings.ldquoThis is a major investment and a vote of confidence in Portrush by Charlotte. There has been an awful lot of thought put into providing much needed luxury accommodation in the area.ldquoWe want Elephant Rock Hotel to provide a really nice venue where people can come and spend an evening and enjoy a fantastic stay."},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaPolitics Johnson still braced for Gray report as police get involved By The NewsroomCrime Bill ‘step forward against stalking’ By The NewsroomOpinion Chief constable’s remarks about IRA role in murder raise questions about NI LettersOpinion Nothing I said should have caused offence to any person who suffered abuse as a Letters leader Doug Beattie during an interview in his Parliament Buildings office at Stormont.\" layout\"fill\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMjcwNjYy.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fill i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"fill\"Politics Doug Beattie gets unanimous support from party officers David Young leader Doug Beattie during an interview in his Parliament Buildings office at Stormont.\" layout\"fill\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMjUxODA.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fill i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"fill\"Politics Beattie implores people not to judge him by his past Twitter posts David Young Cars Self-driving car owners ‘won’t be to blame for crashes’ Matt AllanEducation NI school exams back to normal this year, says minister By The NewsroomPolitics DUP minister seeks Executive approval for continuing NI Protocol checks David YoungPeople RUC GC ‘commitment and sacrice’ to be marked this centenary year Mark Rainey with Economy Minister Gordon Lyons\" layout\"fill\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMjUzMTU.jpg crop:,smartwidth w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMjUzMTU.jpg crop:,smartwidth w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMjUzMTU.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fill i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"fill\"Business Gordon Lyons orders independent review of Invest NI By The NewsroomPolitics DUP man Sammy Wilson: Times come to take back control of NI electricity outfit Adam KulaHealth Tim gets wheels in motion for band event Graeme CousinsPolitics Northern Ireland Protocol: There is a deal to be done says Liz Truss By The NewsroomPolitics Edwin Poots and we issue defamation proceedings against UUP leader Doug Beatti...

Some reviewers have claimed that Belfast lacks sufficient political context. The outbreak of violence in  is not properly explained in the film. Catholics and Protestants just seem to spontaneously start throwing things at each other. Surely Sir Kenny could have added a brief  to  minute prelude to the film outlining basic facts from Irish history starting with the Norman Invasion of . Or,he was pushed for time, maybe from the Plantation of Ulster in . He should at least have provided a comprehensive reading list with every cinema ticket sold. This would allow the film’s viewers across the globe to realise that the trouble in Belfast in  was actually caused by Oliver Cromwell, King Billy, the Pope, and Ian Paisley.Anyway, Kenny —you want to make Belfast , I am available.• My regular readers will be surprised to learn that it actually takes me quite a bit of time to write this column. It’s only around  words long but, dear reader, I can assure you that this is a hand crafted and bespoke newspaper column. Every single one of the words I compose is precious and sacred to me. Each comma and semi-colon is a friend. Every phrase is carefully considered, cogitated, and mulled over. I check and re-check the content. I always ask myself, is there a better way of expressing myself  Is a more pithy phrasing possible  Could the wording be wittier  Are my words open to misinterpretation  It’s only after being fully satisfied that I can stand over every syllable that I will let it be released to the public.If this was my policy, and indeed everyone’s policy when on Twitter, then the world would be a much better place.• Number  in lockdown was like the Holylands on St Patrick’s DayAt the time of writing the whole country is still locked in a bizarre updated version of Samuel Beckett’s classic play Waiting for Sue Gray .By the time you are reading this it will probably have been released so let me make an educated guess or two as to what Sue has found.Basically, during the strictest national lockdown in living memory, Number  was like a street in the Holylands on St Patrick’s Day. Sue will say that she changed her report from an investigation in to when parties took place at Downing Street to listing dates when they actually didn’t take place.There will be photographs of a COBRA meeting doing ‘Rock the Boat’.Sue will reveal that the cabinet were downing tequila shots to celebrate the arrival of Carrie Johnson’s new gold wallpaper.There will be video evidence of Boris holding an impromptu drinks party whilst on a visit to an ICU because it was Larry the Cat’s birthday. Sue will find that you can’t actually be ambushed by a cake.Sue will also allege that she was threatened by Tory Party whips and told thather report wasn’t favourable she’d be going back to running a pub in Newry. To be fair,we all just accept that Boris and his cabinet are permanently on the sauce it would actually help explain Brexit and a lot of other Tory Party policies. For instance, last week, in a desperate attempt to distract from Partygate ‘Culture Secretary’ Nadine Dorries attacked the BBC. I think she’s right. In fact all broadcasters should bow down to the Conservatives and only make television programmes that reflect true Tory Party values. Can I suggest a few suitable name changes of popular shows How about, Come Drink With Me  Strictly Come Boozing  The OneShow  Or a remake of the classic political sitcom Yesh Minishter  Anyway, it’s Wednesday morning and no-one can predict the immediate future. So I’m not saying that Boris is a dead man walking, but I wouldn’t be surprised , on Thursday, several Tory MPs dump him in a Post Office in Carlow.

The PSNI revealed the information in a Freedom of Information request. It explained to the News Letter that the PCTF only fights terror groups which do not post a risk to national security. The PSNI explained that the groups that do pose a threat to national security, PIRA and dissident republicans, are dealt with by the Security Service or MI, working in conjunction with the PSNI Terrorism Investigations Unit .   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Former ACC Alan McQuillan explained how the current policing set up evolved.But the DUP lead on the Policing Board Trevor Clarke, told the News Letter last week that his party and a senior official on the board had never heard of the TIU and never had any briefings from it.Now former ACC Alan McQuillan has explained how the apparent blind spot in the Policing Board oversight of NI policing came to be.He said that as part of negotiations for coming onto the policing board SF demanded that the Policing Board would not have oversight of Security Service activity in order to placate its supporters - that it would not be contaminated by spying on PIRA or dissidents.There was a desire not to put themselves in that position and the government did not want to put them in that position where they would have to supervise the gathering of intelligence against the IRA.“These arrangements have their roots back in the early noughties,” he told the News Letter. “As we moved from the old system where the police led all intelligence, there were two driving forces. The first was that the national [policing] system had changed. The counter intelligence lead on terrorism had shted to the Security Service working with specialist national anti-terrorism command in the police. There was a drive to replicate that within Northern Ireland to make the NI system consistent with the rest of the UK.“And the second issue was that there was a concern that it would be extremely dficult for Sinn Fein joining the Policing Board to step into a situation where they were overseeing the gathering of intelligence against people within the wider republican movement.“And therefore there was a confluence of interest in coming up with this new model which has proved extremely effective - lets be clear - in terms of the impact it has had on dissidents it has really worked. But there was a feeling that, my understanding was, that as part of the negotiations, that these changes were being made as part of the package that led to Sinn Fein joining the Policing Board.”Some unionists complain that there is a constant stream of publicity from the PSNI about successful operations against loyalist criminality, but none about actions against PIRA criminality - with the PSNI having reported that IRA members are still engaged in large scale smuggling, as well as other criminality.Mr McQuillan says that this is “a matter for the chief constable” and adds that it is one thing to gather intelligence but another to get convictions.But he says it is quite clear that while MI is not accountable to the Policing Board, the PSNI’s TIU is, and should appearasked to.“Quite clearly the terrorism groupthat is operating within the PSNI is accountable to the Policing Board and therefore it is open to the Policing Boardthey choose to ask for them, to make themselves of what is going on there. Andthey haven’t it is because the board hasn’t asked for this.”He added that MI has done “a blindingly good job against dissidents here, bringing people before the courts”.“The question is what is happening on the other side in terms of the organised crime  It is about making that visible and making sure that is being done as well as it is being done on the Paramilitary Crime Task Force side.He has previously gone on record to say that his work when heading up the Assets Recovery Agency appeared to be somewhat frustrated.“We were always being criticised that so much of our work was against the loyalists. I think that was fair criticism and I raised it repeatedly but we found it very dficult to get republican cases referred to us. We did get some but I think there was a real issue at that stage and people were desperately trying, I think, to make sure that the peace process was bedded down and I think that we have to look back and say overall and over time, that strategy has worked.“But at the same time we are left with a residue on both sides.”A Policing Board spokeswoman said: “The oversight arrangements in respect of National Security matters, and the oversight role of the Board, were set out in Annex E of the St Andrew’s Agreement.”Sinn Fein was also invited to comment.MORE NEWS:PSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRAPolicing Board ‘not aware’ of existence of PSNI unit monitoring IRA activityRussian naval exercises off Irish coast: Republic is depending on Royal Navy and RAF for defence against Russia, say expertsEx PSNI Chief Constable Sir George Hamilton: IRA Army Council directed Sinn Fein during Kevin McGuigan murderEx-PSNI Chief Constable Hugh Orde: The Historical Enquiries Team was closed down to protect terrorists-turned-politiciansRussian spies are very active in NI says ex-Nato officer, after Russia reveals plans for naval excercise off Irish coastPSNI dodges ex-chief constable George Hamilton’s claim about murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuiganPSNI assessment of IRA Army Council relationship with Sinn Fein remains unchanged says Chief Constable Simon ByrneYoung unionists react to BBC’s Stephen Nolan: Why our peers don’t want to speak out in the mediaA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After a few days in the field, I’ll probably be a bit sore. But, yeah, I really want to work on it.”Banton counts World Cup-winning Buttler among his role models and the similarities between the pair are obvious, having come through the same set-up at Somerset while they are both renowned for their clean and powerful striking.⃣⃣ off just ⃣⃣ for Bants! 👏Match Centre: https:t.co JHAFWphCJ🏝 #WIvENG 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 | @TBanton pic BvAscgEgx— England CricketJanuary , Askedhe is looking to follow Buttler’s pathway, Banton said: “It has to be. He’s probably the best in the world.“I’m quite good mates with Jos and it’s weird because I look up to him, now I get to play with him and it’s awesome. Definitely, I want to follow in his footsteps.”Regarded as one of England’s biggest prospects, Banton has also earned comparisons with Kevin Pietersen but the former England batter was left unimpressed after watching the youngster during a Hundred match last August.In his role as a Sky pundit, Pietersen opined Banton was “wasting” his talent, adding: “He needs to rework the way he goes about his batting. There is a big psychological change that needs to happen there.”Banton was stung by the remarks but a phone call with Pietersen the following day smoothed matters over.\" data-title\"Australia v England –   Ashes Series – First Test – Day One – The Gabba\" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"Jason O’Brien\" data-usage-terms\"Editorial use only.
