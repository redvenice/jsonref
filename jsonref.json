unnamed mariner said in broken English on an open radio channel: \u0027I try to keep them calm but I need immediately, immediately agency assistance.\u0027He added that two of the intruders were on the starboard side near the bridge, although had not managed to gain access.In other radio messages the captain is reported to have said he feared for his life, and those of his crew.The Greek-owned tanker, that flies the Liberian flag, had left Lagos on October 5, where the stowaways \u0027illegally boarded\u0027 the vessel, a spokesman for operator Navios Tanker Management said. The SBS operation was authorised by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel. A source close to the Home Secretary said the 45 minutes during which the situation was resolved \u0027felt like 45 hours\u0027.The heavily-armed troops descended on to the tanker by rope from four Royal Navy helicopters after nightfall.The elite soldiers quickly rounded up the suspected hijackers and ended their mission after just nine minutes.The seven suspected hijackers seized on Sunday night were last night being questioned in separate police stations across Hampshire after the 750ft tanker moored at Southampton.A spokesman for Hampshire Police said: \u0027It was reported that a number of stowaways were on board, and they had made threats towards the crew.\u0027He added: \u0027All 22 crew members are safe and well and the vessel is now alongside in the port of Southampton. Investigators are speaking to the crew members to establish the exact circumstances of what happened.\u0027Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: \u0027I think this has got all the hallmarks of a situation where a number of stowaways are seeking political asylum, presumably in the UK. At some stage they got aggressive. Clearly no one knew at the time how aggressive they were, whether they were armed or not and what their motives were.\u0027In the discussions taking place between the ship\u0027s captain and the authorities in the UK – both police and the military – they will have decided at some stage the least risky option was to board the vessel using the special forces.\u0027The drama echoed a previous case involving stowaways which unfolded aboard a cargo ship in the Thames Estuary in December 2018. Four Nigerians had hidden aboard the Grande Tema in Lagos, and became disruptive as the ship entered UK waters. The four attempted to repel an SBS boarding party by threatening to infect them with HIV, but were eventually arrested and prosecuted. At least one made \u0027throat-slitting\u0027 gestures to crew, CCTV footage played in court showed. However, after an eight week trial at the Old Bailey they were cleared of attempting to hijack the ship and convicted of affray.Two were also found guilty of making threats to kill. They were jailed for a combined total of seven years.That case highlights potential difficulties in securing convictions under the hijacking legislation. "},{"url":null,"title":"Backlog thousands miss stamp duty holiday number mortgage deals halves","story":"Share this article It is currently taking buyers an average of 160 days – more than five months – to go from agreeing a sale to moving in, up from 95 days last year according to property data analysts TwentyCi.And as the stamp duty deadline draws closer, experts fear delays could spiral further.It means an estimated 325,000 property owners with sales agreed between September and January may fail to complete in time as they get caught in the logjam, at a cost of £4 billion to the economy, according to the data firm. At the same time, the total number of mortgage deals available has dropped 55 per cent since January, from 2,477 to 1,099, according to figures from analysts Defaqto.Many high street banks have axed deals for borrowers with small deposits of 5 or 10 per cent altogether.But there is also increasingly less choice for buyers with medium and even large deposits. There are now just 125 two-year deals for those with a 15 per cent deposit, down from 264 in March, according to separate data from Moneyfacts. The number of five-year deals for those who can put down 20 per cent has dropped from 257 to 164.Dominik Lipnicki, of advisers Your Mortgage Decisions, said: ‘Lenders appear to be worried about just how fragile the property market really is and if the current crisis will result in house price falls.‘We have seen a post-lockdown boost, aided by Rishi Sunak’s stamp duty scheme but many agree this may well have been a temporary recovery with darker times ahead.’A spokesman for banking body UK Finance said: ‘Rates offered will be influenced by several factors including the lender’s funding and operating costs, risk appetite and provision for any potential losses over the life of the loan.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Angela Merkel says Germany verge losing control coronavirus","story":"Share this articleGlobal report: Merkel says Germany faces ‘difficult months ahead’ in Covid fight | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c1dec38a4a4b1b5007b92dc1a506e23c9bf31a/0_69_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=eae5faf6323ce9ff6dd39214075f7bf5","title":"portraits of families living together through coronavirus","story":"Photographer Mattia Crocetti’s project COndiVIDendo 19 looks at people living together during the coronavirus crisis, a time when groups have had to isolate and form a variety of family and community units, in Italy and across the worldCOndiVIDendo 19 is a photographic and social project about the cohabitation of Italian citizens during the Covid-19 crisis. The title comes from the Italian conidere, which means sharing, and the images show groups of people living together in isolation, whether they are families, single people or mixed groups.Every picture belongs to two authors, the home-based photographer and the subject, and they share the whole process of creation of the final picture via a video call. The subjects their time, their life, their intimacy and their image, first with the photographer and then with society. This process, in addition to the narration of the day-to-day cohabitation of the subjects, serves the social and community purpose of sharing your own mental and physical condition, from inside to outside, similar to the very human need to interact with the rest of the community.Rudy: “It has been a hard time. We have tried to spend time together dedicating ourselves to our passions in our small house in Florence. We managed to train in the little space we had at home. It was difficult but we succeeded and so we were able to vent our anxieties and emotions of that difficult moment.”Some families managed to reunite after the Italian government imposed lockdown measures on 9 March 2020, while others were separated, with some family members left stranded in remote places. In other cases, single people were forced to cohabit with strangers. During the health crisis, the meaning attached to the word cohabitation has changed, creating new relations from a forced sharing, in particular, of spaces, habits, feelings and fears.Giulia was able to observe at first hand the great love between her parents, who in lockdown celebrated 47 years of marriage. But, for the first time, it was she who took care of them, not vice versa. Maria Vittoria sewed the masks using the online “tutors” (video tutorials), found by Giulia, while she was taught the secrets of the garden.

We heard about the health emergency in Italy, but by then it was too late. So we decided in a meeting that we would continue the journey and when possible we would come back to Italy. We were afraid we could not return home, but we continued our journey away from the health emergency.”Prisca, a photographer, and Val, a stylist and model, live and work in London.

I was very worried about my relatives in Italy and every day I watched the news from my house in Uruguay”.Fulvia: “If before we were planning the next journey, at this moment we were only hoping to be able to see Fulvia’s family in Italy again at some point. Fulvia called every evening with her family back home comparing the numbers in Italy and Germany with the ones of the day before. One of us lost the job, and the other one was lucky enough to be able to work remotely.But yet we were the lucky ones, as we spent our days in our living room learning the things we thought weren’t so important as our job or our life outside. So we practiced singing, playing the guitar, started indoor gardening, creating handmade goods and taking care of each other, in short, we learnt how to give value to our time.”Lucrezia and Oliver have their own company, Oliver Party Express, which rents furniture. They took advantage of the quarantine to work behind closed doors in the laboratory on new projects. The laboratory, located a few metres from both their homes, allows them to produce new objects.

Veronica says: “Even a lay eye can sense that I have an eventful life. I was partying until the night they called the red zones. I was in Trentino. The quarantine has made me rediscover my home ... the peace of an evening in bed reading with a lighted candle or watching a movie with my sister. Now I no longer go out every night. I also rediscovered the pleasure of being at the table with my parents. Working far away, I never came home, and I missed lunches. Emotionally it was a gift, the quarantine. My family has benefited a lot from it.” Martina: “We lived our lockdown locked in our house outside Padua. Walter and I create special effects for the world of cinema. For example, this is an enlarged reconstruction of Rita Levi Montalcini. Luckily we have our own laboratory near home. During the lockdown we were able to work every day and finish some personal projects.”Just before the lockdown, Francesca and her friend Andrea left Milan to join the Della Seta family in Carrara.

But I feel acutely the loss of working relationships and external stimuli – the chance conversations, listening to very different people with very different lived experiences, the exposure to new ideas and experiences.“These losses will grow with time. At some point, they will offset the benefits of avoiding South West Trains.”The government was forced to halt a drive to get white-collar workers back to offices last month as a rise in coronavirus infections grew into a second wave, leading to tough new restrictions. After ordering people back to work following lockdown, in part to help revive struggling city centre economies, the government then told people to work from home if they could.Entering the debate over the longer-term consequences of the shift in working arrangements, Haldane said he believed neither five days a week working from home nor five days working from the office was good for personal wellbeing or the economy.In a speech delivered online this month, published on the Bank’s website on Monday, he said the sheer volume of virtual meetings was harming the capacity for people to share information vital for building trust and new relationships.Although saying home-working provided a quieter, less distracting environment to help with “tunnelling”, or focusing on work – which could aid with generation of ideas – he warned: “What creativity is gained in improved tunnelling is lost in the darkness of the tunnel itself.”The Bank’s chief economist said some productivity and wellbeing gains had been recorded from home-working, but that people were often also working longer hours when they would normally be commuting. Senior staff stood to benefit more than new starters, and women had also taken up a higher share of childcare than men, he said.The rise of Zoom calls and remote working during the pandemic has driven a wedge in society between people who can work from home and those who need to continue travelling to their jobs, putting themselves at more risk.According to official figures, workers in IT and professional jobs are more than twice as likely to work from home than people in lower-paid retail, healthcare and manufacturing roles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f41da14b1ef8634ab27383b9b3be49f246c735/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c866597dfbaaf99f9320719f0b7caf51","title":"government pig headed free school meals","story":"Perhaps No 10 is worried that deeply awkward questions will be asked as to why so many families need help in the first placeWhen in a hole, it helps to stop digging. This government has now so categorically lost the argument over extending free school meals through the holidays that the only way of escaping with any dignity is to give in. When every other small cafe owner in England seems to be offering free sandwiches to kids over half-term, even while struggling to keep their own businesses afloat in a pandemic, then you should know you’ve lost. When lifelong Conservative voters, whose churches make regular collections for the food bank, are dismayed, then you’ve lost. When your own MPs are sending text messages such as the one I got, worrying that free school meals could become this government’s poll tax – well, sooner or later a U-turn becomes inevitable.They may want to call it something different, dress it up not to look like a retreat. But the cabinet can’t keep twisting themselves into the kind of knots Matt Hancock did on Monday morning, telling Radio 4’s Today programme that on the one hand he agrees with the footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to stop children going hungry, but on the other hand – no, they won’t actually do what Rashford wants. The prime minister’s promise a few hours later that no child would go hungry at Christmas, even if he couldn’t actually explain how that would be guaranteed, suggests he now realises the position isn’t sustainable. The only mystery is why it took so long.One answer is the sheer pig-headedness of a No 10 operation that would rather risk Manchester revolting against lockdown rules in the middle of a pandemic than be seen to give an inch to its mayor, Andy Burnham, and which still thinks the only route to a Brexit deal is threatening to storm off without one. The only thing it knows is conflict, aggressively returning fire with fire it prides itself on never being seen to back down, even if that does sometimes mean cutting off its own nose to spite its face. The Downing Street comms mantra is that if it just toughs things out for long enough, as it did over Dominic Cummings’ now notorious road trip to Barnard Castle, the media storm will pass.But what it seemingly failed to notice is that this time the enemy isn’t the media or even the Labour party, which pushed the issue to a vote in parliament. This time Downing Street is up against a footballer rapidly approaching the status of national treasure, and lots of small needy children. Boris Johnson has reportedly now made contact with Rashford, but a smarter, less pugnacious operation would have ensured they’d talked weeks ago, just as it would have sent Johnson to Manchester in person to explain to the city why he wanted to put it into tier 3 against its leaders’ wishes, rather than firing potshots from London in a way that merely inflamed old tensions between north and south.This isn’t just about No 10, however. Rishi Sunak has been mysteriously absent throughout the free school meals furore, fuelling speculation that for once this wasn’t a case of the Treasury refusing to cough up but of Downing Street making a political decision not to surrender. In truth, the Treasury may have been more preoccupied with yet another course correction, in the shape of the multibillion-pound package of extra support for employers it unveiled last week, after widespread complaints that its original job support scheme wasn’t actually enough to save jobs once furlough ends. To the Treasury, focusing on this arguably makes sense saving jobs should in turn stop more children falling into poverty in future. But it’s confusing for voters, who can’t reconcile all those soothing words about the government putting its arms around the nation with stories of parents skipping meals so their children can eat. If there’s money to bail out business, why not for a few lunchboxes over half-term?One explanation, perhaps, for the failure to engage properly with the argument is that this government is quietly worried about where it might lead. It’s a relatively short step from giving out free food vouchers in a crisis to making that the norm even after the pandemic, to asking some deeply awkward questions about why so many families need this help in the first place, even in many cases when they’re working. Might it have something to do with the fact that this country now has among the lowest benefits in Europe, alongside relatively high housing costs and years of stagnating wages?But if that’s the reason they’re shamefully ducking this argument, the Tories have badly miscalculated. Johnson needs to do the right thing on free school meals, and do it quickly. But he should also realise that it won’t be the last such dilemma he faces, as the pandemic pushes more families into poverty. If, as the Tories keep saying, free food is just a “sticking plaster” solution, then sooner or later people will rightly expect to see a cure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a7eae0e444c4f625d6f8aa7da6ccb8f4b13a96/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e9ff06d0d3b532068798cad1c2ed64c","title":"the guardian view on trustbusting google change is needed","story":"Tech giants are not playing according to economic rules set by the market, but by rules they largely set themselves. That won’t washWhen the US Department of Justice filed a complaint against Google last week it triggered the most significant antitrust case since the federal authorities sued Microsoft in the 1990s. Today’s trustbusters argue that Google’s search and advertising dominance goes well beyond consumer preference and into consumer abuse by forcing people to use its services and bending them to its data collection practices.With rivals unable to gather as much browsing data and therefore compete with Google’s search results, the DOJ claims the company has an iron grip on web ad revenue. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, made $34bn in profit last year, almost all of it from online advertising. Consumer harm is conventionally measured by prices. A standard defence is that Google’s users are the product and advertisers are its customers, so who is being hurt? The company says people don’t have to use its search engine but they choose to.Even if Democrats win the White House, the public anger at big tech means the Google case is unlikely to be withdrawn. It could rumble on for years. The company might be broken up eventually. The European commission has found Google guilty of antitrust violations three times from 2017-19, resulting in fines of €8.25bn. But lawmakers and watchdogs are too often dazzled by Silicon Valley. Mathew Lawrence of the Common Wealth thinktank points out, in a forthcoming report, that UK regulators are more bark than bite. He says there was tough talking when Amazon proposed taking a stake in the UK’s Deliveroo platform. But the deal was cleared with barely a squeak. The US is signalling, for now, a tougher approach. Change is needed because technology has become power. That power must ultimately work for the public rather than just the shareholders of platform monopolies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16499a39a0d4fba38780ab6bdf073cee40e88d9b/0_32_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=00f3326445783faee510cf5c7310ffdd","title":"lemon juice legumes and local activism what green habits have you adopted in 2020","story":" supporters around the world tell us about the sustainable lifestyle changes that they have committed to during lockdown – and beyondWe started to order food from the local store for curbside pickup. We went online and bought a freezer. Bought a food vacuum sealer and ordered bulk orders from our favourite butcher and fish monger. Started to stock up on other staples. We have canned and vacuum stored fruit too. John Dorosiewicz, 65, Toronto, CanadaOur biggest change has been switching from supermarket shopping to the local shops. We’re on the Isle of Man, so are dependent on UK-based supermarkets importing goods to the island to stock the shelves of their Manx branches. However, during lockdown, not only did the local Manx shops suddenly start doing home deliveries and setting up websites, but local farms and food producers began to make their goods available both as deliveries and also to island shops they didn’t previously supply. Jean Butterworth, 86, and Kate Butterworth, 53, Isle of Man We have fully committed to growing as much fruit and veg on our allotment and preserving it for the winter. We will be self sufficient in some items and we never use any pesticides. We’ll also eat less meat and far more fruit and veg. Janette Jordan, 63, Cambridgeshire, UKWe used to buy most of our fruit and vegetables from a farmers’ market, but we now get a weekly box and top up from local shops – ideally independent ones. Our second source of fruit and vegetables has become local shops which previously traded as cafes, delis and small restaurants. With these sources of income closed off by Covid-19, they turned instead to selling fruit, vegetables, bread etc – items they would have bought for their original trading business. This option keeps local businesses going and hopefully will encourage some to make green grocery part of their ongoing business model.Judith Russenberger, 59, London, UKThis year, my tenant (who is semi-retired) and I decided to plant as many vegetables as possible. We did a lot of digging and got some compost delivered. It was good to be outside, getting exercise and eating organically. We grew lots of lettuce and swiss chard, garlic and fava beans in the spring. Some of our summer crops have been so prolific that we have been sharing green beans, figs, apples and tomatoes with friends and neighbours. We have also taken up canning and freezing.We have also gotten to know our neighbours better because we were all around our houses more. Then, in June, my tenant and I decided to build a garden shed from scratch, using many found materials from around the neighbourhood. Kathryn Ogg, 71, Victoria, British Columbia In our neighbourhood there is a very nice street-food market where we buy our supplies for the week. The vendors are farmers from the region around, some “bio”, some not. I regularly buy milk from a farm between the woods close by where they raise cattle that have a pretty casual life on the meadows of the valley. When you bring your own bottle you can directly tap the milk from an automat in a little room where you can also buy cheese and sausages. Geertje König, 53, Bonn, GermanyMy main change is that I have tried to grow more vegetables in the garden. I have before grown tomatoes and runner beans and have many productive blackcurrant bushes, but this year as soon as the garden centres reopened I went out and bought some broad and french bean seeds and planted them. The french variety were disappointing but broad were OK. I am also cultivating the tomato plant that appeared in the pot where my husband and grandson planted an acorn!Margaret Elms, 70, Devon, UKWhen lockdown began, we built a chicken coop and run for eight chicks - soon to be hens. We are still waiting for our first eggs. Peter England, 76, British Columbia, CanadaAside from avoiding meat, and anything with too much wrapping, I use vinegar and lemon juice to clean as much as possible with the least possible use of any chemical cleaners. I do not buy beauty products tested on animals and keep purchases of cleansing products down to an absolute minimum. I use cloth shopping bags and avoid using plastic bags at all cost. Finally, I will always go for the organic option if finance allows and look for fair-trade marks and other signs that the producer is considering the environment. Duffy Tomei, 66, Essex, UKI don’t use teabags which often have plastic in them. And I won’t buy sandwiches from shops using plastic-lined sandwich packaging.Caroline Quick, 77, Cambridgeshire, UKThere is a weekly event on Fridays at my local church. We asked people to give a donation to church funds and expanded the range to include plants, as we had already been sharing spare seedlings and young plants using a WhatsApp group. This initiative reduced food miles and gave people access to fresh, usually organically grown, fruit and vegetables. The meeting soon flourished and became a mini social hub.Liz Little, 69, Wells, UKAmid all the chaos and uncertainty of the virus, lockdown was a blissful family time. I truly appreciated for the first time things I have taken for granted – a garden, stable family life, my health. In our local park, Miyah, my youngest daughter, provided me with a moment of total clarity that led me to question my whole way of life: I was trying to stop her picking up a plastic bottle among the litter strewn along the side of the path. She stared at me: “But we can’t leave it here, it’s bad for the animals.” It dawned on me that it really is that simple. I have always felt sad about litter, but never felt it was my job to do anything about it. I felt suddenly ashamed of that attitude and we have since become regular litter pickers in our local park.I also wrote to my MP for the first time, requesting that he support the climate and ecological emergency bill, which was recently brought to parliament and offers real hope for a better future. Talking to people on my street made me realise that many people share these feelings. We started sharing ideas, it was empowering. We have now organised a community recycling project in our street. We collect a range of plastics not accepted in our kerbside recycling collection to take to Terracycle collection points. We hope this idea might spread.Jenny Norbury, 39, Manchester, UKI wanted to tell you about my local Soroptimist club in Chester whose members have committed to not buying new clothes from the start of lockdown until the end of 2020. Buying from charity shops, and essential supplies (underwear!), is allowed, but otherwise we have committed to each other to try to reduce the clothes and shoes we felt we were buying unnecessarily. Geraldine Garrs, 48, Chester, UKI have been involved with climate change for a number of years, most recently spending five and a half years as chair of trustees of Operation Noah, a faith-based charity devoted to climate change. I have used the lockdown to try to reduce domestic single-use plastics even further. I have never purchased bottled water and a few years ago gave up even the very occasional spontaneous takeaway tea in favour of only ever using my reusable cup. I have not bought either hand sanitiser or disposable face masks, relying instead on hand-washing and washable cloth masks. Nicky Lyndon Bull, 66, Hertfordshire, UKThe biggest change we’ve made during lockdown, thanks to a  article on the Money page a few Saturdays ago, is to trade in our old car for an electric car. Now we can look knowingly, but not too smugly I hope, at other electric car drivers when we come across them, rather like we look at other  readers when buying our paper! Mike Smith, 66, Southampton, UKSince July 2020, I decided to share my Tesla Model 3 with our employees – our Italian physiotherapists – so they can visit their relatives without buying a car, and without using air travel.Felix Niedermann, 55, Lucerne, SwitzerlandEarly this year we decided to switch to a more sustainable source of heating. Our house is now heated by an air source heat pump.Wiebina Heesterman, 83, Birmingham, UKWe installed a 6.4kWh solar PV system (heats the hot water, provides power through the day and exports large volumes to the grid, even in the UK!). We had the house cavity wall insulated. And we gave up a passionately loved hobby, skying – powered by fossil fuels unfortunately. Michael Grant, 60 and Alice Grant, 64, Hampshire, UKWe have done lots of little things to help. I set the thermostat low, put on more clothes if it’s cold, have solar and hot water panels to maximise electricity production. In addition, we’ve installed triple-glazed windows to keep heat in and cold out. We also make our own elderflower cordial and of course drink tap water, never bottled water. Caroline Quick, 77, Cambridgeshire, UKA year ago I went all electric, having an air source heat pump installed and replaced the gas cooker with an induction top electric cooker. Six months ago I had a small room super-insulated inside the external walls, insulation under the floor where the boards were replaced by sheets of water resistant fibre board. These were glued together and sealed round the edges so were draught-proof. Finally, the roof insulation was topped up. It is now a warm snug little sitting room, having previously been the coldest room in the house.Nan Howitt, 80, Leeds, UKLockdown meant that the money we usually spent on travel, dining out, concerts, etc built up in our bank accounts. We took a conscious decision to spend that surplus on those goods and services suffering most economic damage, buying much more online and giving work to local builders and tradesmen. John Davies, 79, and Jacqui Davies, 74, Wales, UKI live in Montreal, Canada and during April and May especially we enjoyed wonderful fresh air and quiet in our suburb. The large international airport is about 16km away and the planes don’t usually fly over our neighbourhood, so we hadn’t realised how much noise was emanating from that airport! The peace and quiet set me thinking about other airports and what noise we produced when we took flights going here and there on vacations all over the world. Even though one of our daughters and her family live in Sweden, we have decided to think twice before hopping on a plane.Diane Campbell, 74, Quebec, CanadaLast year, I took 37 flights. I haven’t taken a single flight in the past six months. In short, if I can go by plane, I can also go by bus, for the vast majority of the travels I do. I hope now that 2019 was the peak of my flight fuel consumption. Anna Sawicka, 28, Vilnius, LithuaniaSince the end of March, we have decided to reduce or stop completely travelling by air. We will spend holidays in this country or in places that can be reached by train.John Harris, 80, and Christine Harris, 78, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UKThe footpaths near where I live traverse marshland, so quickly become overgrown. I’ve always been outdoorsy so decided to have a go at mowing with a scythe. It ticks all my boxes – it gets me outdoors into the fresh air, lets me see the wildlife not often observed – such as owls, foxes, mice, frogs, butterflies and wildflowers (which of course I mow around, allowing them to flower), it’s free exercise, provides a great sense of purpose, keeps the public footpaths clear and open, and as an ornithologist I delight in seeing the winter arrivals of geese, ducks and migrant birds.William Hancock, 68, Suffolk, UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d2690c1987d8922015a2d832c76390085feecd/209_128_1711_1026/master/1711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f082468ed045e132f70deb25e4815531","title":"wall of the wild animals on the us mexico border in pictures aoe","story":"Mexican photographer Alejandro Prieto has captured the erse wildlife threatened by Donald Trump’s barrier, winning a number of awards, including the Fritz Pölking prize, with his project Border Wall"},{"url":null,"title":"the guardian climate pledge 2020 environment emergency carbon emissions","story":"In 2019, the  made a pledge in service of the planet.

Then, when he did, slowly, he mixed them. Not so much confused but resourceful when he couldn’t find the word in one language he just used the other, creating Italian and English word-sandwiches, which, despite knowing better, made me smile – or worse, laugh, and he would scowl at me. But no scowl was greater than the one when I told him he was lucky that he was half-Italian and half-English. He scrunched his face up, but didn’t make any noise – just stared – then walked away. A few minutes later, he came back into the kitchen, reinforced with a toy. “I am half nothing,” he told me. “Sono tutto Italiano, and all English.”This was a few years ago now, but I flash back often, especially when something I say or do is met with a dark scowl. Aged nine, he not only speaks two languages, but he is now the one laughing: at my imperfect Italian and Vincenzo’s great but accent-soaked English, but also at himself his intentional mixing, bi-lingual swearing, his choice of two words from both languages.The choosing is particularly noisy around food and at the table, the setting for so much laughter and silent scowling. Also when he helps me cook, which happens less often as I’d like to say, because I am so often impatient, or working to a deadline. In fact, this is not a column about me encouraging my child to cook, but about Luca asking me to let him spezzare (break) the chocolate for the pudding, il budino. Why use only one good-sounding word when you have two?The Vocabolario Treccani notes that budino comes from the English “pudding”, under the influence of the French boudin. The origins are uncertain, but it certainly meant a sausage originally a blood one. In the same way that English black pudding is related to pudding, Italian sanguinaccio – blood sausage – is related to sweet sanguinaccio: a rich, dense budino made with blood and chocolate. While in England pudding signifies a universe of different and wondrous forms, the Italian budino signifies a softly set preparation, which can be made of various things. The Vocabolario Treccani goes on to describe budino as prepared with flour or other ingredients (rice, semolina, potatoes, ricotta, almonds, chocolate, milk, eggs, sugar) and cooked in a mould in the oven, a bagnomaria, or simply over a low heat, which is what I, what we, do.The magazine La Cucina Italiana promises you can make this budino in a mould and invert it on to a plate. It is my failing, I’m sure, that I have never had success in doing this, unless I double the cornflour, which means I lose the soft, tender wobble, which is part of the pleasure of this untroubled budino. And I like it served in a big bowl in the middle of the table, ready to be dolloped into bowls. It is even better served with thick cream. Just remember there are many words, in both languages, to describe this budino or pudding – many of them funny, all good, all whole.In a pan, heat the milk until it almost boils. Meanwhile, in another pan, melt the butter and sugar over a low flame until they turn to liquid, remove from the heat and whisk in the cornflour, making sure there are no lumps.Still off the heat, gradually add the milk to the buttersugarcornflour mixture, whisking constantly.Put the pan back over a low flame and, always stirring, bring it back to an almost-boil, which should take about six minutes. Add the chocolate and whisk strongly for another minute so it melts. Scrape into a bowl or mould, or six inidual glasses or cups, and chill for at least five hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/469b3268f98dffd4a5a3ab6826ceadf74e8bcdf7/0_1536_4080_2446/master/4080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bfffe036e8857df36e72c84a3e7be86","title":"the 20 best sandwich recipes","story":"Pierre Koffmann’s croque monsieur, Rick Stein’s mackerel baguette, and Claire Ptak’s peanut butter and jelly: the recipes to transform your working-from-home lunchA bold boast maybe, but we proudly stand by it.

Son is now the Premier League’s top scorer with eight while Spurs shoot half a dozen places up the table as a result.That was tough for Burnley to take, because despite not registering a goal at Turf Moor this season they were enjoying the better of the chances before Son struck from a set piece. Harry Kane, whose header set up Son’s scoring chance to record yet another assist between the pair, had just cleared a James Tarkowski effort off the line in what amounted to the nearest the game had come to an opening goal. Kane went down the other end to change all that by meeting Erik Lamela’s corner to set up Son’s close range finish, leaving the home side disappointed after managing to hold a side who won their last two away games 5-2 and 6-1 for well over an hour.“Three very important points,” was José Mourinho’s verdict. “This was the kind of match with all the ingredients to drop points, a cold rainy night in an empty stadium with opponents who defend very well. I knew from the start we wouldn’t be allowed to play the way we wanted to play, but we wanted very much to win. We always do. I don’t change my speech. We want to win every game, and when you have a combination like Kane and Son you will always have a chance.”With Josh Brownhill booked for bringing down Tanguy Ndombele with barely a couple of minutes on the clock, Ashley Barnes was lucky not to receive at least the same punishment after catching Toby Alderweireld in the face with his elbow as he jumped for a high ball. The Spurs defender was left with a boxer’s cut just below his right eyebrow, and as medics worked to stem the flow of blood and wrap a Terry Butcher-style bandage around Alderweireld’s head there would have been countless opportunities for VAR to check the incident. The result was simply play-on when the player was fit to continue. Mourinho managed to look concerned and unimpressed at the same time.The Tottenham manager would have been more incensed had his side gone behind when Barnes put the ball in the net five minutes later, though the score was correctly ruled out for offside. There was no need for VAR to check the linesman’s decision either, since Barnes and a couple of his teammates were ahead of the visitors’ back line.Tottenham managed to pin Burnley back in their own half for much of the early part of the game without quite managing to find the telling final ball their snappy approach work merited. The home side had a let-off when Son could not react quickly enough when an attempted Nick Pope clearance went straight to him and when the same player found himself in a similarly threatening situation after half an hour Ben Davies’s pass from the left went behind him.This was the fixture last season when Mourinho was publicly critical of record signing Ndombele’s overall contribution, though now the France midfielder appears to be fully in favour, at the expense of Dele Alli. The England player did not even make the trip to Lancashire, fully fit but left out of the squad, though with Ndombele full of confidence and running and Gareth Bale in reserve on the bench it is hard to argue Spurs are currently short of attacking options. “It hurts me to leave good players out, but we have another match on Thursday, we don’t have to risk everyone,” Mourinho said.When Ndombele was caught in possession by Brownhill on the edge of the area, it took a good save from Hugo Lloris to keep out Ashley Westwood’s low drive. Lloris was in action again just before the break, this time keeping out a Johann Gudmundsson effort. The Iceland midfielder was never likely to score, but at least Burnley were working the opposition goalkeeper. By the time the interval arrived, with Kane frequently deep or wide, Pope was still to face a shot on target despite Spurs enjoying two-thirds of the possession.When Mourinho sent on a substitute for the last half hour it was not Bale but Lamela. Burnley were continuing to threaten at that point, albeit from distance, although it took an alert block from Alderweireld to prevent a Barnes shot from the edge of the area reaching its target. Tarkowski managed to meet Westwood’s corner too, just not in such a way that he could properly direct a header from inside the six yard line. Davies had to block from Westwood as Burnley passed the ball neatly around the Tottenham area, before Tarkowski reached Westwood’s corner but found Kane standing on the line. Burnley probably thought they had done enough to deserve at least a draw, but goals change games and Son’s took Spurs up to the dizzy heights of fifth, while Burnley’s inability to score is as worrying as only having a single point after five games.“I was disappointed to let in a soft goal after defending so well,” Sean Dyche said. “But there are signs we are beginning to play well again, we kept a very good team quiet for most of the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1370ba2e89c9340e7e4a188258cf117c8c160f56/0_560_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4089e490c3ae7c11ce323f7da071a1b5","title":"design review get the newsletter for the way we live now","story":"Sign up to get a monthly dose of creative inspiration, emailed direct to you.

Whichever candidate won there could usually expect to enter the White House. It remains true that no Republican candidate has ever taken the presidency without winning Ohio.

Tech journalist Sarah Frier looks at how it went from a tiny startup to a multibillion-dollar business, and the impact the social media company has had on our livesSarah Frier is a tech reporter based in San Francisco who has watched the meteoric rise of Instagram, from its humble beginnings as a startup with a handful of employees to becoming a $100bn company. She talks to Rachel Humphreys about how the photo-sharing platform has become the most influential app of the past decade.  Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder, was 25 when he started his company with his friend, software engineer Mike Krieger. Systrom realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones, and with Instagram the app would also offer filters that people could use to make their photos – and by extension, their lives – look more appealing. In 2012, with just 13 employees, the company was bought by Facebook for $1bn. With the introduction of Instagram Stories, its growth accelerated, but the relationship between the two companies was complicated and Systrom and Krieger eventually left Instagram in 2018. Mark Zuckerberg now controls two of the most important social media networks in our lives.

While the beneficiary continues to own and profit from the investments, they are no longer involved in its day-to-day management.In theory, blind trusts allow people in public office to continue to own investments in companies, while avoiding the accusation that there is a potential conflict of interest.While blind trusts are mostly used by politicians, other people in sensitive positions such as journalists, charity workers and even religious leaders have placed their personal assets into blind trusts. In the US, President Lyndon Johnson was an early adopter of a blind trust, as he did not want to sell the Texas television station he owned before entering the White House. Donald Trump and Theresa May both set up trusts when they became president and prime minister respectively.Because they can abused. While they allow politicians to appear to be making decisions free of the accusation of personal gain, blind trusts let politicians own substantial investments free of any public scrutiny as their contents are private.While an actively managed share portfolio, held in a blind trust over a number of years, would allow the beneficiary to argue no conflict of interest, campaigners say a newly appointed minister who had recently transferred their assets into a blind trust would still be aware of where their money was invested.While the beneficiary and the trustee are required not to discuss the trust’s investments and the former should have no influence over the latter, there is little to stop this happening on an informal basis, and it is not policed in any way.Some politicians will sell anything that could be construed as a conflict of interest – Barack Obama sold all his stocks shortly after becoming a senator.In 1998, a parliamentary report by Lord Neill found the use of blind trusts to be “inconsistent with the principles of openness and accountability“ and recommended that such trusts be “prohibited as a mechanism for funding political parties, party leaders, members of parliament or parliamentary candidates”.No. The ministerial code says it is up to the personal responsibility of each minister to decide whether and what action is needed to avoid a conflict or the perception of a conflict.When Theresa May became prime minister she did set up a blind trust, but had chosen not do so when she was appointed home secretary. David Cameron did not use a blind trust while Tony Blair set one up after becoming prime minister. It later emerged that his wife, Cherie, had directed the trustees to buy two flats in Bristol – the start of what grew into a £27m property empire.The trust is simply dissolved and the assets are returned to the original owner, complete with any gain or loss accrued while the investments were held in the trust. Politicians who create a blind trust for their assets when elected usually will terminate it once they leave office and any conflict of interest questions are eliminated.Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “The truth with this trust is that the only people that are blind to it are the public. The chancellor only set up the trust 18 months ago but the public has no idea where the money is or whether there is a conflict of interest. With public trust in this government plummeting, greater transparency in all their dealings is essential and the chancellor must show a lead.”Sunak registered a blind trust in July 2019 after he had been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury under the previous chancellor, Sajid Javid. Under a standard blind trust arrangement iniduals can still receive income from their investments but cannot make decisions about how the money is invested.The campaigners and MPs are concerned that Sunak will know where his money was invested before he placed it in the blind trust, and that raises concerns that his decisions as chancellor could be influenced by his personal stakeholdings.The financial transparency campaigners have also called on the chancellor to be categorical on the question of whether any of his wealth is sheltered in offshore tax havens.Abena Oppong-Asare, the shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: “Rishi Sunak needs to be completely transparent with the public about whether any of the funds he invested in a blind trust are held in offshore tax havens. Taxpayers paying their fair share expect nothing less.”Sunak is the only chancellor to have used a blind trust since details of ministers’ interests began to be published in 2009. Seven serving ministers hold a blind trust, compared with 13 in 2015.Richard Murphy, a visiting professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and a self-described “tax justice campaigner”, said: “The problem with this arrangement is that the blindness is for the public. We literally know nothing.”Daniel Beizsley of the financial transparency campaign group Spotlight on Corruption said: “The issue as I see it with Sunak is that unless the trustee was given specific instructions to ersify the portfolio, then Sunak is fully aware of its contents. It’s difficult to see how this could absolve him of conflict of interest claims. Additionally, by placing assets into the blind trust arrangement, the public’s ability to judge potential conflicts is reduced as his ministerial declaration is now empty.”Sunak’s spokesperson refused to comment, but a Treasury source said: “Blind trustsblind management arrangements are longstanding mechanisms for protecting ministers in the handling of their interests. They ensure ministers are not involved in any decisions on the management, acquisition or disposal of items in the arrangement.“Politicians of all stripes have used blind trustsblind management arrangements to ensure they avoid any conflict of interest, including the last Labour government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ae31891ddf2cebfbf7fa6ec324c00ca46d98f8/0_0_4186_2512/master/4186.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=11842b94dcf2596419429b3be633f4b1","title":"journey into a black hole part 1 podcast","story":"They are among the most enigmatic phenomena in the universe, confounding physicists and mathematicians.

Right now, sex trafficking is too profitable and too easy in this country”.Johnson said: “Our government just sits back, allowing sex buyers to continue abusing and pimping websites to continue profiting.“It’s time for Priti Patel to stop Britain being a pimp’s paradise by making paying for sex and online pimping criminal offences, as well as decriminalising victims of sexual exploitation and giving them the support they need to rebuild their lives.”Kat Banyard, director of UK Feminista, which organised Monday’s summit, said: “The UK is a high-value, low-risk destination for sex traffickers. To start winning the fight against sex trafficking, the home secretary must crack down on pimping websites and combat demand by criminalising paying for sex.”The Home Office insists it is committed to tackling human trafficking but it is unconvinced that criminalising sex work and pimping websites is effective.A source said: “The acts of buying and selling sex are not in themselves illegal in England and Wales. However, there are many activities that can be associated with prostitution which are offences.”A Home Office spokeswoman said: “Our priority to protect victims from harm and exploitation, and target those who exploit vulnerable people involved in prostitution.”Laetitia Gotte, the president of Asociatia Free, a group that supports victims of sexual exploitation in Romania, said the UK had become “one of the top destination countries for sex trafficking of Romanian women”. She added: “Taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of Romanian women is unacceptable. Demand must be stopped.”Organised criminal gangs in Romania exploit the desire of some Romanian women to find work in the UK, according to the APPG report.They tended to be targeted by men who begin a relationship with them and then promise to find them legitimate work in the UK, and organise or pay for their travel to the UK. “In every trafficking case we have convicted, the victim’s ‘boyfriend’ has been part of the trafficking ring,” said Peall.When the women arrive in the UK they are told they are in debt to a criminal gang and coerced into prostitution. Tactics include debt bondage, physical threats, the withholding of ID cards, surveillance and violence.Peall said: “Coercive control is a key tactic used by pimps and traffickers to recruit and maintain control over their victims.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dad30598fcc1d11018a39fc99961362691fd0df/0_45_2237_1343/master/2237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db4525204346b914940c2b76f4521618","title":"ecb global silence pakistan ipl exile","story":"The unspoken, unexamined decision of the Indian Premier League to ignore one country has turned the dressing room into a proxy battlefield, the auction into a theatre of warLast week, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced it is in the process of organising the first official England tour of Pakistan in 15 years. This is, self‑evidently, the right thing to do. Since England’s last visit in 2005-06, Pakistan have toured this country eight times for various tournaments and series. From the ECB’s perspective, their decision to brave the pandemic and send a team this summer may well have proven the difference between financial ruin and mere recession.And so naturally the decision to consider the possibility of maybe, potentially, exploring the idea of touring Pakistan for a very short Twenty20 series in early 2021 – subject to all the usual security and logistical caveats – has been spun in many quarters as an act of supreme munificence. Yet if England are genuinely keen on extending the hand of solidarity to Pakistani cricket, then there is something else it could do. It could politely but pointedly use its voice at next month’s International Cricket Council board meeting to ask why Pakistani players continue to be excluded from the world’s biggest cricket tournament.Yes, the Indian Premier League, currently unfolding behind closed doors in the United Arab Emirates: a competition that likes to think of itself as the sport’s ultimate meritocracy, its global melting pot, a place blind to heritage or tradition. The cricketing embodiment of Martin Luther King’s vision, in which your four little children will be judged not on the colour of their passport but on their ability to execute their skills in an elite performance environment.Of the 20 countries represented in the IPL in the past decade – including Nepal, the Netherlands and the US – Pakistan remains frozen out, ghosted since the inaugural season in 2008. (Azhar Mahmood, the sole exception, was technically a British citizen.) We all know why. Or at least we think we do. It’s something to do with security. Or politics. It just hasn’t really been explained, or even properly talked about, in about a decade.Which, when you think about it, is pretty weird. Very few of the practical justifications for excluding Pakistani players hold even the slightest water. This is a competition that has managed to relocate its entire apparatus halfway around the world at a moment’s notice, creating a whole chain of rigid, biosecure bubbles across the Gulf. They could probably find a way of keeping Shaheen Afridi safe if they really wanted to.In reality, this is a decision driven largely by ideology, nationalism and geopolitics: the dressing room as proxy battlefield, the auction as theatre of war. So here we are: an IPL in the adopted home of Pakistani cricket, without any Pakistanis in it. And not by rule or decree, but simply by convention: it has always been and thus will it always be.There are two points to make about all this. The first is that this is how power operates in its purest and most devastating form: unspoken and unexamined, implicit and invisible. You don’t ask. You just know. This, more than any amount of ICC politicking or revenue-grabbing, is the best way of understanding India’s influence over world cricket.The second is that even if you set the principle of the thing to one side, this is so clearly a self-defeating arrangement. Imagine how much richer a spectacle the IPL would have been with the participation of Umar Gul or Shahid Afridi or Mohammad Amir, how much their expertise could have enriched others.This is a sadness that works in two directions: the experience not accumulated, the wealth not earned, the lives not transformed. Indeed, one of the more remarkable footnotes of T20 history is the way so many Pakistanis have managed to bestride the format without the benefit of its pre-eminent tournament: the equivalent of an elite footballer unable to test themselves in the Champions League. Pakistani bowlers make up five of the 13 highest wicket-takers in T20 history. The Pakistan Super League has gradually managed to build itself into one of the world’s leading competitions. All this while effectively being placed under sanctions.You might ask what all this has to do with England. After all, there are many valid criticisms of the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, but a failure to broker a peaceful solution in Jammu and Kashmir is not one of them. At the very least, though, this is the sort of issue that deserves to be raised, not buried discussed, not dissolved that should be part of any conversation on the future of the sport and how its leading nations deal with each other.Because if cricket’s past decade was defined by the question of wealth and how to share it, its next decade will surely be about borders and how to define them. In a world of walls and bubbles, the very concept of international cricket is being imperilled before our eyes. This is, and perhaps has always been, a deeply fragile ecosystem: a loosely strung web of temporary alliances and fleeting friendships, a world based on reciprocity and mutual interest and, above all, the audacity of shifting thousands of people all over the world for weeks at a time.English cricket, as everywhere else, needs to decide whether this is a vision still worth fighting for. Cricket, at its best and most uplifting, can breach borders, forge connections, serve as a window into the world. That only works, however, if the window is open in the first place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba63c6d478bce7917d0e162698e6105eb246a5db/192_308_5001_3000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=78353d4970d6f5516d9f8308cfa3c5d0","title":"apple ipad air 2020 review a cheaper ipad pro for the rest of us battery camera","story":"Pros: modern design, great performance, good battery life, great screen, USB-C, iPadOS, plenty of apps, great speakers, great mics, great video-call camera, long support, recycled aluminium.Cons: no Fortnite or cloud game streaming, no multiuser support, relatively small storage on the starting model with no way to add more, comparatively expensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949383eee27531e97a216d157f88bc655319cd4a/0_62_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aeb17bebde936ed718db8b00580bdac","title":"castles stately homes and monuments eight places where history was made in the uk","story":"Discover the first castle to fall to gunpowder, the first stately home opened to the public and the National Trust’s inaugural acquisitionLongleatThe Elizabethan seat of the Marquess of Bath can boast two big firsts.

They are not cheap, are selling out fast, and booking timed tickets is generally essential (there tend to be more slots available on weekdays and later in the evening), but these festive spectacles offer an hour or so of pure escapism, and we could all do with a bit of that right now.Stately avenues with palatial vistas? Check. Baroque architecture? Grassy slopes and natural-seeming lakes? Picturesque clumps of trees? Check, check, check. The park around Blenheim Palace is one of Capability Brown’s largest landscape designs and the formal gardens at its heart are tailor-made for the mesmerising light trail that winds through them each winter. The lights pick out the sculptural forms of a craggy old oak or elegant cedar, sweep across the lakeside woods and turn the winter-full cascade a spectrum of different colours. There are lasers, pulsing vines, a flaming-torch-lit rose garden and several new installations for 2020, including fire sculptures floating in the water garden and Blue Neuron, a kinetic light sculpture made from recycled plastic bottles, that sends blue light dancing through the branches. And, since the Christmas market is cancelled, this year’s trail ends, for the first time, with a grand light-show finale in the Great Court.• Selected dates from 20 Nov-3 Jan, childadultfamily from £13£19£60 (£1 off for pass holders), blenheimpalaceA rainbow of floodlit trees and sparkling walkways are staple fare for winter light trails, and Westonbirt’s kid-friendly show also has flashing lights, smoke effects and a forest of candy canes.

Other major successes that kept viewers watching to the end include BBC Three’s hit comedy This Country and more niche shows such as Sky Atlantic’s Italian crime series Gomorrah.Although viewing habits are changing fast, putting a programme in a primetime slot on BBC One will still give it a major advantage in raw viewing figures over a programme broadcast on the less-watched Channel 5. This analysis, which looked at viewing figures for scripted programmes shown in the UK since 2018, attempted to strip away this promotional advantage and reveal which channels can commission dramas that attracts loyal viewers.However, the league table lacks information on the performance of shows on leading streaming services, which refuse to release their viewing figures to be audited as they view such information as commercially sensitive. As a result it is near-impossible to tell whether the hype around shows on the likes of Netflix or Amazon Prime Video has actually translated into loyal viewers.As a result many television commissioners at traditional channels complain the streaming companies can make disastrous punts on big-budget shows without having to face the embarrassment of a show becoming a ratings flop in a very public manner. Instead, the only sign that a Netflix show has lost its audience is likely to be when it is quietly cancelled at the end of a series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e4f732e4121785c84e0f882412c5d8ac681272f/1330_129_3670_2203/master/3670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f4f6b6055fcd9e42a5446834c35908","title":"i wanted to show that he was loved yinka bokinni on her neighbour damilola taylor","story":"Twenty years on from a crime that shocked the nation, the radio presenter remembers the life of her friend and neighbour in a new Channel 4 documentary, The Boy Next DoorYou will always remember the place where you spent your formative years. For me, that place was the North Peckham estate in south-east London. It may come as a surprise to people who have heard it described as a notorious place that many of my memories there are happy ones – of never-ending summers and picnics and badminton. However, until last year, I hadn’t been back since 2001, because of something that happened when I was 11. My neighbour, who had in the space of a few months become like another brother to me and my siblings, was killed. His name was Damilola Taylor. Like so many children who die in tragic circumstances, his picture and his story remain familiar across the country.Up until then, I had had what I thought was an idyllic childhood – an urban version of living in the countryside. I was one of seven, and all the kids on the estate went to school together, hung out at home together, ate together. You could eat dinner at anyone’s house. Now that I am an adult, I realise it was probably because a lot of the parents worked nights and everyone was looking after each other’s kids. But when I was younger, it was just a big, extended playtime.I remember the day that Dami arrived, in August 2000. It was common to have new kids popping up from around the world – Nigeria, in Dami’s case – even though the estate was in the process of being demolished at that time. There was an auntie on the sixth floor – not my actual auntie, but we called every older person uncle or auntie. She called down to my friends and I while we were playing on the grass. She told us that her son was coming down and that we needed to play with him. She hung over the balcony with her gele – her headscarf – on and watched him come down to meet us.Dami was 10, a year younger than me. He was loud and very tactile. We got into a few fistfights, although it was never serious – we were just kids, messing around and being naughty. He was definitely the most fearless of our group – he would be the one riding his bike down the biggest hills or walking on the highest balconies. My dad is from Nigeria, too, so there was a kind of affinity between us. I remember when it started to get cold – he was flabbergasted at the weather, because he was from a warm place and was used to wearing shorts all the time. He had that big silver jacket on, the one he was wearing in November, all the way from August. I think he was excited to be here and he had all these kids wanting to be friends with him.I would be lying if I said that North Peckham seemed like a safe place – I had seen police and sirens many times before. But there was just something different about that day – 27 November 2000. The police locked down the estate. I remember our living room was lit up with blue and red flashing lights. My mum told us to get an early night – I think she probably knew someone had been killed, but I don’t think she knew who it was. I was off sick from school the next day and when I came downstairs the morning news bulletin was on. Dami’s photo flashed up. I remember being so confused, because I had seen him the previous morning. The bubble I had been living in was shattered. Between November and April, when we left the estate, I didn’t see my friends again. A lot of people moved out quickly and we were one of the last families to be rehoused by the council.As my life continued, I avoided the truth of what had happened. I had friends from every other area of my life, but I didn’t speak to anyone from North Peckham again. Last year, I decided it was time to confront it. I would make a film about Dami, 20 years on, to show people that he mattered. As with so many cases, from Sarah Payne to James Bulger, people know his picture and his name, but I wanted them to have another view on who he was – I wanted people to know that he wasn’t destined to be a victim. As someone from Peckham who has gone on to have a successful media career, I wanted to show that I am not the diamond in the dirt and that there is light and shade in every situation. I wanted to show his dad that he was loved and that his death wasn’t inevitable because of where he landed.I reconnected with others who had lived on the estate to share our memories. It was cathartic I had buried my head in the sand and built this happy, wacky persona, but there was this dark thing that I had never spoken about with anyone, not even my mum when she was alive. It was therapeutic to have those conversations, although it was tough to relive the trauma. No kid should have to walk past the spot where their best friend was killed for five months. The police left the crime-scene tape blowing in the wind and I would run past it every day.When we first started making the documentary, I found it hard to make sense of the two sides of North Peckham. There were the long summers and the water fights and the games – and then there was this. Looking at the archive footage and seeing cockroaches and remembering how our walls would move – things like that consumed me. I think it was speaking to Francesca, one of the friends with whom I reconnected, and looking through her photos of us there that made me realise that two things can be true at the same time. I can have my nostalgia, my summers and my Christmases while also accepting that terrible things happened there, that is was a violent place. Long before we moved to North Peckham, a major tragedy was considered a “when” rather than an “if”.I often think about what Dami’s life might have been like. When I was at university, I wondered what he would have studied – would he have gone on to be a doctor or a lawyer or another profession expected by our Nigerian parents? Would we have been close? Or would he just be someone on Instagram saying: “Hey, remember me?” I don’t know if he would have been somebody I would have had a coffee with or someone I would have just bumped into. Those are questions we will never answer – and that is where the tragedy lies. “What if?” kicks you in the gut.Hopefully, the programme shows that, for the short time he was with us, Dami was loved by our community. He was a vibrant kid with a life to live – and he was our friend.Damilola: The Boy Next Door is on Channel 4 at 9pm on 28 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4851dab680815654afab8cbe5d47581d1d4b4886/0_248_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=917c1264391f1c8cbf2134a3fe667261","title":"california power outages high winds latest","story":"A power company in southern California says its equipment may have sparked a fast-moving wildfire that has forced evacuation orders for around 100,000 people and seriously injured two firefighters.The Silverado fire sparked early in Orange county on Monday, quickly jumping a highway and exploding to 4,000 acres. The fire had doubled in size within two hours, with strong wind gusts pushing flames along brushy ridges in Silverado canyon toward thousands of homes. In total, 20,000 homes in the city of Irvine, 40 miles south-east of downtown Los Angeles, have been evacuated, according to firefighters.In a report to the state Public Utilities Commission, Southern California Edison said it was investigating whether its electrical equipment caused the blaze. The brief report said it appeared that a “lashing wire” that tied a telecommunications line to a support cable may have struck a 12,000-volt conducting line above it, and an investigation was under way.More than 90,000 people in the fire area were under evacuation orders. A fire in the Yorba Linda area had grown to nearly 4.7 square miles (12.2 square kilometers) and prompted the evacuation of at least 10,000 people, Associated Press reported, citing officials.“It’s one of the hardest things any fire chief can do, to report that one of their firefighter family members had been injured or worse,” said fire chief Brian Fennessy. “This is tough for me, tough for all my firefighters and certainly tough for the families of my two injured firefighters.”The area of the wildfire is experiencing erratic wind speeds of 20 to 30mph, with some gusts up to 70mph. Captain Ben Gonzalez, the spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority, described the winds as “swirling” and “unpredictable”. The wind whipped smoke and ash into frenzied funnels, flickering embers and flames wilder and more chaotic. Trees and vegetation bent and swayed dangerously with every gust.The winds were so strong that firefighting planes, which dump water and retardant on flames from above, cannot fly , Fennessy said.“This is a tough fire,” Fennessy said. “We’re experiencing very high winds, very low humidities. Our firefighters are some of the bravest in the world. This is a very hazardous job.”Meanwhile, much of southern California remained under red flag warning through Tuesday with strong Santa Ana winds underway, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties were also experiencing high winds, with a weather station east of Santa Clarita recording a gust of 96mph and a station in Angeles national forest recording one at 79mph.Southern California Edison had said earlier it was considering safety outages for 71,000 customers in six counties starting Monday, with San Bernardino county potentially the most affected. Across the state, utility companies cut off power to about 300,000 customers in an effort to prevent the chance of their equipment sparking wildfires amid powerful winds and dangerously dry weather conditions.An estimated 1 million Californians were expected to be without power on Monday.Northern California saw gusty winds on Sunday night, with a weather station on Mount St Helena recording a hurricane-force gust of 89mph late on Sunday and sustained winds of 76mph. By early Monday, however, winds had calmed slightly, and no new major fires were reported.Another round of winds was expected on Monday night, and a red flag warning for the East and North Bay mountain areas was extended through 5pm Tuesday.“This event is by far the largest we’ve experienced this year, the most extreme weather,” said Aaron Johnson, the utility’s vice-president of wildfire safety and public engagement. “We’re trying to find ways to make the events less difficult.”This week’s weather conditions were similar to those during devastating fires in California’s wine country in 2017 and last year’s Kincade fire. Fire officials said PG\u0026ampE transmission lines sparked that Sonoma county fire last October, which destroyed hundreds of homes and caused nearly 100,000 people to flee.Los Angeles county urged residents to sign up for emergency notifications and prepare to evacuate, preferably arranging to stay with family or friends in less risky areas who are not suspected to have the coronavirus. Local fire officials boosted staffing as a precaution.“The reality is come midnight and through Tuesday we’re going to be in the most significant red flag conditions we’ve had this year,” said Kevin McGowan, director of the county’s office of emergency management.Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable. Traditionally October and November are the worst months for fires, but already this year the state has seen more than 8,600 wildfires that have scorched a record 6,400 square miles (16,576 sq km) and destroyed about 9,200 homes, businesses and other structures. There have been 31 deaths.Many of this year’s devastating fires were started by thousands of dry lightning strikes, but some remain under investigation for potential electrical causes. While the biggest fires in California have been fully or significantly contained, more than 5,000 firefighters remain committed to 20 blazes, including a dozen major incidents, state fire officials said.It is the fifth time this year that Pacific Gas \u0026amp Electric, the nation’s largest utility, has cut power to customers in an effort to reduce the risk that downed or fouled power lines or other equipment could ignite a blaze. On Sunday, the utility shut off power to 225,000 customers in Northern California and later did the same for another 136,000 customers in a total of 36 counties.PG\u0026ampE officials said the planned outages are a safety measure and understood they burden residents, especially with many working from home and their children taking classes online because of the coronavirus pandemic.Sheriff Kory Honea of Butte county said he was concerned about residents in foothill communities during the blackouts because cellular service can be spotty and it was the only way many can stay informed when the power is out.“It is quite a strain on them to have to go through these over and over and over again,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be005bc1938d74d8f845bfdc9146262d7a33e807/0_185_5551_3331/master/5551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1a49bf14f9e93ab2836bf71adf8573","title":"mike pence tests negative covid surge","story":"Democrat also criticizes Amy Coney Barrett celebration plan at White House, while Trump says Biden ‘doesn’t leave his basement’A day after his own chief of staff said the US had effectively surrendered to the coronavirus, Donald Trump told reporters rival Joe Biden, had “waved the white flag on life”, while the Democrat nominee warned the president about holding “super-spreader events”.“He doesn’t leave his basement,” the president told reporters of Biden, on arriving in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania for a campaign rally. “He’s a pathetic candidate.”Biden, who leads Trump in most national and battleground state polls, did not have any campaign events officially scheduled on Monday. However, Biden unexpectedly emerged late Monday afternoon, also in Pennsylvania, on his way to a campaign field office in Chester, near Philadelphia, and briefly spoke with reporters, by defending his campaign style versus Trump’s.He said: “The big difference between us, and the reason why it looks like we’re not traveling, we’re not putting on super spreaders.”Biden also criticized Trump for planning to hold a White House event later in the evening to celebrate the likely confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court.The Democratic nominee noted several people who attended last month’s Rose Garden event, where Trump announced Barrett’s nomination, later tested positive for coronavirus.“And when the president of the United States puts on these super-spreader events, you saw what happened when she was announced – all the people, including his family -- thank God they seem to be okay – all the people who came down with Covid, I just hope he was willing to have learned a lesson,” Biden said.Biden noted he understood why Trump wanted to celebrate, but he argued it was “not appropriate” given the number of coronavirus infections is surging across the country.The Democrat expressed hope that attendees would wear masks and practice social distancing to limit the risk of coronavirus spread at the event.Some Republican senators have even seemed hesitant to attend the celebration, even though they have championed Barrett’s nomination.Biden added: “Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this pandemic.”The president, meanwhile, repeated his insistence that the US was “absolutely rounding the corner” in the fight against Covid-19, despite rising case numbers across the US and an outbreak among senior aides to Mike Pence.US deaths per day from coronavirus are on the rise again, just as health experts had feared, and cases are climbing in nearly every state.A spokesman said the vice-president and his wife tested negative for coronavirus on Saturday and Sunday. Pence has stayed on the campaign trail.The national caseload of more than 8.6m and a death toll of 225,000 continue to be the world’s highest. El Paso, a Texas border city which is the site of a particularly virulent outbreak, has gone back into lockdown.Battleground states including Michigan and Wisconsin are seeing surging case numbers, health systems creaking under the strain. National new case numbers hit a record high on Friday, at more than 83,000, just missed that mark on Saturday, then dropped to around 60,000 on Sunday. The seven-day average of new cases hit 68,767 – the highest since the start of the pandemic.One influential study has predicted 500,000 US deaths by February.At the White House, the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, sought to clarify a remark he made to CNN on Sunday, in which he said: “We’re not going to control the pandemic.”Asked if the Trump administration was “waving a white flag”, Meadows said: “The only person waving a white flag along with his white mask is Joe Biden. We’re going to defeat the virus. We’re not going to control it.”Meadows added that the administration would “try to contain it as best we can”, and claimed his remark on Sunday had been taken out of context.“We need to make sure that we have therapeutics and vaccines, we may need to make sure that when people get sick, that, that they have the kind of therapies that the president of the United States had. Then we can provide those emergency using authorisations. Hopefully they’ll be coming in very short order,” he said.Trump spent three days in hospital after he, his wife, their son, senior aides and Republican leaders contracted Covid-19, after a White House event held to celebrate the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court.Barrett is due to be confirmed by the Senate on Monday evening. Meadows said the White House would host a celebration, adding: “Tonight we’ll be doing the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible.”After news broke that Pence’s chief of staff and a senior political adviser tested positive for Covid-19, the White House designated the vice-president an essential worker, meaning he did not have to follow federal guidelines and quarantine for 14 days, and could carry on campaigning. Trump is also campaigning at events at which mitigation measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing are not strictly observed.Dr Anthony Fauci, the most senior US public health adviser, on Monday, Fauci repeated his contention that the US is not yet out of the first wave of coronavirus infections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59d1b7fa8572ab3438902d55c95a1c244ac7aeb0/1222_356_7066_4238/master/7066.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=eb65e98afac83a7c97a806e3c1eddca8","title":"mayor of rome says she was targeted by mafia","story":"Virginia Raggi says she was told organised crime groups planned to kill her and her familyThe mayor of Rome has said organised crime groups planned to kill her and her family because she was taking them on in parts of the Italian capital where they hold sway.Virginia Raggi became the Eternal City’s first female mayor when she was elected in 2016 in a breakthrough for her party, the Five Star Movement, which now governs nationally. She is running for re-election next year.She said in a pre-recorded TV interview that the Casamonica family, notorious for its criminal activity, targeted her after she demolished some of their illegally built villas in 2018, forcing her to live with a police escort.“We have been informed that they were planning an attack against me and my family,” she said, without giving further details.Raggi said she was also fighting other powerful mob clans, such as the Spada family in the seaside neighbourhood of Ostia and the Marando family in San Basilio, on Rome’s eastern outskirts.“There are parts of Rome where people come close to me to tell me to keep on fighting but then they move away because they are afraid of being seen by the clans,” she said in the interview on Canale 5.Raggi has had a rocky time as mayor. Her first years in office were dogged by legal difficulties and numerous defections from her city government. In 2018 she was found not guilty of charges that she had lied over the appointment of the city’s head of tourism, a job that went to the brother of one of her closest aides.

Forty-one are named, many from former “red wall” seats, plus two from north Wales and one from Scotland, while 14 are anonymous.More than 2 million people in West Yorkshire could join them by the weekend after local leaders met ministers on Monday to discuss further measures to combat soaring cases. A further 20,890 UK cases and 102 deaths were confirmed, with a further 1,142 taken to hospital – though weekend numbers are often lower.The letter published on Monday expresses concerns “that the cost of Covid could be paid for by the downgrading of the levelling-up agenda, and northern constituencies like ours will be left behind”.The MPs write: “We believe this would threaten to undermine the government’s hard-won mandate in December, at a time when the political and economic case for the levelling-up agenda we have been elected to deliver has never been more essential.”They argue that the north of England has seen a level of disruption unparalleled with other parts of the country. “The virus … threatens to continue to increase the disparity between the north and south still further. Northern parts of our country were among the first to be significantly adversely affected by the Covid outbreak and now many communities have been put back under severe restrictions,” they add.The group asks the prime minister to create “a pathway down the tiering system” and to accelerate key road, rail and social infrastructure projects, and job creation. He should develop “a tailored economic recovery plan” for the north, they say.The MPs remind Johnson of a speech he gave on 30 June in Dudley in the West Midlands, claiming: “We must use this critical moment to address the problems we have collectively failed to tackle for decades.”All are under significant pressure from constituents furious that the government refused to extend free school meals over half-term, though only one signatory (Jason McCartney, MP for Colne Valley) voted against the government on the policy last week. Jake Berry’s Rossendale and Darwen constituency has been under local lockdown measures for months and is now under tier 3 along with the rest of Lancashire. He said: “Our party’s return to government in December was won on the back of hard-working people in constituencies like ours who backed the Conservatives for the first time in a generation, and who did so on the promise that they would not be forgotten.“We cannot forget that we must deliver on our commitments made during that election, to level up northern communities and create opportunity across our region.”Another signatory, William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Stockport –\u0026nbspwhich went into tier 3 as part of Greater Manchester last week – said: “We have long needed a good deal for the north from the government, and the virus has only exacerbated that need.“This isn’t about giving government a tough time – the prime minister shares our collective priority. But there are compelling and constructive arguments we, as a group of northern MPs, can make to government about how it delivers on its promise to level up the north.”Tier 3 restrictions will come into force at 12.01am on Tuesday for Warrington in Cheshire and 12.01am on Thursday for Nottingham and its commuter suburbs of Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowe, it was confirmed on Monday. The rest of Nottinghamshire will remain in tier 2.The new measures mean all pubs and bars must close unless they are serving “substantial meals”. Alcohol can be served only with food. Additional closures include betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos and soft play centres.Infection rates in Warrington are among the highest in the country, with case rates at 361 people per 100,000 – double the England average of 180.6.Leaders in West Yorkshire met senior government ministers and the deputy chief medical officer on Monday to discuss whether their region should also enter tier 3. In a statement afterwards, they said: “The latest data on infections and hospital admissions shows a continued rise, and we have repeated our calls to government that further local action needs to be taken, including strengthening community engagement and test and trace. There will be further discussions with government in the coming days.”A No 10 spokesman said: “We are absolutely committed to levelling up across the country and building back better after coronavirus. We stood at the last election on a solemn promise that we would improve people’s lives, and although the pandemic has meant 2020 is not the year we all hoped it would be, our ambitions for the country are unchanged.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d4d465bda0bba41284de65df83762a8f613930/0_87_2608_1564/master/2608.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e0141a0171f913e95a1e65bb2ff1909b","title":"uk residents tell us about the impact coronavirus is having on your household","story":"We would like to hear how your livelihood and income have changed since the start of the pandemicA joint report has called for a “family stimulus” package to help parents and children from falling below the poverty line this winter.The IPPR thinktank and the TUC have said hundreds of thousands of are at risk with more families being forced to rely on food banks.We want to hear about the impact coronavirus is having on your household.

It followed last week’s approval of a $1.8bn weapons package sale, including missiles, rocket artillery, aerial reconnaissance sensors, and an August sale of 66 F-16 fighter jets.Lockheed Martin said foreign arms sales were “government-to-government transactions” and all of its international sales were “strictly regulated by the US government”. It said its China presence was limited.A spokesman for Boeing said the company remained committed to its partnership with China’s aviation community.Zhao called on the US to stop selling weapons to Taiwan or having military ties with it.“The US arms sales to Taiwan severely violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, and seriously undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns it,” he said.“We will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests.”The three China-US communiques were signed when the US cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan to recognise the People’s Republic of China more than four decades ago. The US does not formally recognise Beijing’s claim over Taiwan, and recently declassified Reagan-era cables detailed security assurances given at the same time, committing to continued arms sales with Taiwan without Beijing consultation.US relations with Taiwan have grown as they have soured with Beijing. This year the US has sent two government delegations to Taiwan, prompting Chinese threats of countermeasures. Washington adjusted its one-China policy in response to “the increasing threat posed by Beijing to peace and stability in the region” and its targeting of Taiwan.Taiwan’s foreign ministry welcomed the defence sales and said: “In the face of China’s military expansion and provocations, Taiwan will continue to strengthen the modernisation of its defensive capabilities and accelerate the improvement of its asymmetrical capabilities in order to maintain regional peace and stability.”Taiwan is building up its defence capabilities to discourage any possible cross-strait conflict. It has spent more than $1bn this year in scrambling jets to respond to increased Chinese military drills and sorties over the so-called “median line” in the Taiwan Strait.Dr Ou Si-fu, vice president of the Taiwanese defence think tank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said Taiwan won’t receive the defence materials for years, and the military needed time to train its personnel and in some cases build the infrastructure to house the assets."},{"url":null,"title":"what s it all about online learning terms explained","story":"The arrival of coronavirus to these shores prompted a swift pivot away from the traditional face-to-face style of teaching most students were familiar with since the first day they attended primary school.Students nearing the end of their time in college had their finals to look forward to while others had essays, assignments and end-of-year exams to contend with. That all changed with the lockdown.“The move to emergency remote teaching, learning and assessment was a huge challenge, but one which all academic staff engaged in overnight. The response by both the staff and students, to such a dramatic transition to remote online space, was phenomenal,” says Dr Mary Fitzpatrick, head of the Centre for Teaching and Learning at University of Limerick (UL).As colleges began moving their programmes online for the final semester, educational priorities quickly changed. Gone, all of a sudden, were the classes, lectures, tutorials, trips to the library and group-work meetings.In came video conferencing, online quizzes, virtual learning platforms, specialised simulations, asynchronous and synchronous teaching.The shift to online does have its benefits.“Some of the benefits of course delivery online include flexibility: students can work at their own pace, supporting independent and self-directed learning, and allowing them to fit learning around the rest of their lives and unlimited access to practice and revision resources,” says Dr Alison Hood, dean of teaching and learning at Maynooth University.Many will be unfamiliar with some of the terms associated with distance learning, blended learning and remote learning but this is likely to change in the coming months and years as these learning strategies grow in popularity. Many of these concepts are interrelated – and they all involve learning – but what do they mean inidually and how do they relate to each other?Distance learningA 1960s Australian children’s television series might not be the first thing that springs to mind when we consider the merits of distance learning. Yet for many, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo is where they first came across the practice.The series told the story of a young boy called Sonny and his adventures with his pet kangaroo friend Skippy. Sonny lived in a remote national park and had to use a two-way radio to connect with his teachers in order to receive his education. Thanks to the development of internet technology, distance learning has advanced quite a bit since then. The tools and methods traditionally associated with it such as correspondence courses, educational television and, in the case of Sonny, two-way radios, have now largely been replaced by online learning platforms. In many cases, the interactive online learning environment used to deliver distance learning courses is now the very same platform used by students who attend the face-to-face courses traditionally associated with third-level education.Colleges and universities have improved their ability to deliver distance learning programmes while at the same time offering comprehensive support for students. In short, distance learning is when students don’t attend classroom lessons in person. Instead, they receive instruction, and learn and study from home.Classes are usually conducted over the internet and students can submit assignments remotely. As distance learning offers students the flexibility and convenience of not having to be physically present in the learning institution, the advantages are numerous. Students can access class resources from a single location, they can save substantially on transport and fees as courses offered through distance learning are usually significantly cheaper than traditional classroom-based pedagogy.Blended or hybrid learning This is where the traditional form of face-to-face learning converges with the newer methods of remote and online instruction. Blended learning uses technology to improve the learning process and is the model most likely to be adopted by third-level institutions as ongoing social distancing requirements limit the possibility of traditional in-person lectures taking place in the medium term.Blended learning is customisable and, as a result, a wide range of approaches to the method means the balance between in-class teaching and the use of technology varies from programme to programme. Advocates say it offers the best of both worlds. The curriculum is usually delivered through a combination of classroom-based lectures, online lectures and the use of other online resources. Ideally, these course components complement each other to strengthen the overall outcome.Blended learning also offers students the benefits of in-class engagement with instructors with the flexibility of online learning. The degree to which the course is blended depends on the course programme and the institution in question. Most Irish colleges and universities offer a suite of blended learning courses across undergraduate, graduate and professional level categories. This is likely to continue even when social distancing measures are in place.eLearning Short for electronic learning, eLearning is a term that essentially means learning with the aid of digital tools. It has its roots in distance learning. The internet has contributed greatly to a marked growth in the use of technology for the delivery of education over the past decade and has helped the development of new models of teaching, improved instruction methods and the possibility of better student outcomes.Technology is at the centre of eLearning and without it the programme could not be delivered. Students use computer and internet technology to access the curriculum from outside the traditional classroom.It is widely seen as a flexible and efficient way of delivering the curriculum as most people with a stable internet connection can access these tools and participate in some form of online learning.It is also efficient. Students no longer have to worry about attending a lecture or class at a set time, they can review lecture videos as often as they like, there is no commute time and it can help develop time-management skills. Unsurprisingly, it is often the preferred option for students who are working or who have other constraints on their time.This form of learning is also used in a wider context. In recent years we have seen a sharp growth in demand for online digital courses. Courses called Moocs (Massive Open Online Courses) first appeared in the late 2000s and were seen as a disruptor which would widen access and lower the costs associated with traditional modes of learning.Critics sometimes cite poor student engagement as one of the greatest drawbacks of eLearning. In traditional classroom settings, students can raise their hand and engage in face-to-face interaction with their instructor but it is not as easy to raise the hand digitally in an eLearning environment.The very nature of the approach means students will invariably spend a lot of time on their own in front of the computer screen and the lack of social interaction can lead to a sense of isolation.Tools do exist to facilitate better communication however and the development of video software now means students can interact directly with instructors through video-link. Depending on the type of course undertaken, practical assessments can be difficult to cater for well.Emergency remote teachingNot to be confused with distance learning or online learning, emergency remote teaching is a measure that is adopted in response to a crisis where the curriculum has to be rapidly moved to a virtual online setting.The unintended consequences of emergency remote teaching can include a failure to meet the expectations that students had at the outset of the course. Simply broadcasting a lecture with the aid of a video conferencing tool or uploading a presentation to a virtual learning environment is not the same as presenting course content that has been planned, developed and designed for delivery via a framework that best enables learning to take place.The sudden change in delivery model can mean a change to how course material is absorbed by students and it can also mean a change to the assessment model which can be disruptive for those students who had prepared for another format entirely over a lengthy period of time.The needs of all students might not be met by sudden change, and unexpected barriers such as the digital ide and other inequities can arise. There is also the danger that in the absence of a coherent emergency plan that teaching objectives can shift from the achievement of pre-defined learning goals to enacting a crisis management approach instead.While the process of moving from an established teaching method to an unfamiliar new platform can be difficult, emergency remote teaching can be a useful learning experience as instructors quickly learn to apply what works and discard what doesn’t.Synchronous learningSynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at the same time but not in the same place. Synchronous learning usually involves the use of online tools such as chat and videoconferencing where students and teachers can interact in real-time during class. Class activities typically take place through the use of dedicated virtual learning environments (also known as learning management systems) such as Brightspace, Moodle or Canvas.Asynchronous learningAsynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at different times and locations. Asynchronous learning often utilises elements such as email, pre-recorded video and other tools such as online discussion forums that facilitate the sharing of information.Learning management systemSometimes referred to as virtual learning environment or virtual learning platforms, learning management systems are web-based software platforms which facilitate the delivery of course content. Platforms provide teaching tools and supports but also allow course instructors to track student performance over time.Multiple formats such as video, audio and text are catered for and students can be assessed through tools such as online quizzes and questionnaires.They are in widespread use at third level and can be used to deliver asynchronous or synchronous-based courses. Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Virtual classroomA virtual classroom is an online learning environment where students interact in real time with the instructor and with each other. Usually delivered via videoconferencing tools, virtual classrooms are also a feature of learning management systems. Students can also usually interact and ask or answer questions by using a chat window. Presentation tools such as PowerPoint or whiteboard tools can usually be utilised by the teacher during class. It is also possible during a class or lecture to operate break-out rooms where students can work together or where the instructor can interact directly with an inidual student.WebinarA webinar is a class in which participants view the same screen at the same time. Very useful in a classroom setting, the instructor controls proceedings and participants can communicate through the use of interactive features such as chatrooms, polls and quizzes.Collaborative toolsThis is usually a reference to materials such as PDFs, slideshow, spreadsheets, presentations, images or text documents. These tools are usually found as a feature within the learning management systems.Flipped classesA feature of some blended learning approaches where lectures are replaced by classes or tutorial-type settings. Students consume content – perhaps by viewing a lecture video or completing an assignment – at home before engaging in analysis and discussion in the live class setting. The practice results in more face-to-face time and affords the instructor greater flexibility in being able to engage directly with students during class, and it can help increase student engagement as they are required to prepare material ahead of the class."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Legislation will require financial advisers to ask for environmental and social preferencesF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland has \u0026lsquoserious concerns\u0026rsquo about siting and scale of proposed development\u0026lsquoWhat often gets overlooked is positive and tangible change occurring at farm level\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Co Kerry is notable for exotic species escaped into the wild from \u0026lsquobig house gardens\u0026rsquoThe Hidden Lakes of Connemara offers \u0026lsquoa tribute to a fascinating landscape\u0026rsquoYoung author and his family live as \u0026lsquoclose as otters\u0026rsquo at the foot of the Mourne MountainsMichael Viney: Mola mola, with its appetite for jellyfish, are in warmer Irish watersClimate change has \u0026lsquogreatly enabled\u0026rsquo a national surge in the range of deerMichael Viney: Despite the threat of disease, Ireland\u0026rsquos living elms can still surpriseMichael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockIreland has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world, with only two out of three women initiating it before leaving the maternity hospital, according to a new report.In one smaller maternity unit, just one in three women try breastfeeding their newborn during their stay, according to the Irish Maternity Indicator System 2019 national report.Nationally, 63.8 per cent of woman initiate breastfeeding at their baby’s first feed, compared with rates of 90 per cent in Australia, 81 per cent in the UK and 79 per cent in the US, the report points out.On discharge, just 37.3 per cent of mothers are breastfeeding, with one maternity unit recording a rate of under 20 per cent, the 2019 figures show.Last year, only 19,076 out of 51,152 babies born in 18 out of 19 maternity units were being exclusively breastfed on discharge from the maternity hospital.Prof Michael Turner, clinical lead, HSE national programme for obstetrics, described the figures as disappointing.According to a World Health Organisation target, half of all newborns should be exclusively breastfed after six months. According to the most recent figures, 13 per cent of Irish babies are breastfed after six months, compared with a European average of 25 per cent and a global average of 38 per cent.Decrease in birthsThe total number of births in Ireland has fallen by almost 12 per cent since 2014 and almost 20 per cent since 2008. Last year, there were 59,352 births, down from 61,084 the previous year.“The decrease in births over the last decade may reflect a fall in immigration from eastern Europe and a fall in family size,” said Prof Turner. “This has implications for the maternity services but also, in due course, for class sizes in schools.”There were 1,068 multiple births last year, or 1.8 per cent of all births, with the highest rate of multiple deliveries occurring in large maternity hospitals in Dublin and Cork. The report says this has “serious” implications for the provision of services at these sites.Last year, there were four maternal deaths, defined as death during pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of the pregnancy. Two of them occurred in the same hospital. There were six maternal deaths in 2018.Miscarriage misdiagnosisThe report says it is disappointing that two cases of miscarriage misdiagnosis were reported, the same as in 2018. “While miscarriage is common, estimated as affecting one in five pregnancies, incorrect diagnosis of miscarriage may result in some pregnancies being terminated unnecessarily.”It says an increase in the incidence of swabs being unintentionally retained in women after delivery is concerning. Two of the six cases occurred in the same hospital. In one unit, more than half of all women having their first baby were delivered by Caesarean section.The overall rate of Caesarean sections increased again, to 34.3 per cent of all births. Rates varied from 27 per cent to 41 per cent across different maternity units.The number of perinatal deaths, which includes stillbirths and early neonatal deaths up to six days, increased by 19.7 per cent year on year, though Prof Turner said the rise may be due to “random variation”. Some 73 newborns were sent for whole body cooling, a technique used to minimise the risk from oxygen deficiency during birth.There was a significant fall in eclampsia cases, from 21 to 11, while 68 cases of maternal sepsis were recorded."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4388162.1603353440!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"life under level 5 where can i go who can i see what is closed and what is open","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced that the entire country will move to level 5 for a period of six weeks.

Two blocks are on Dominick Street in the north inner city, with one on the North Circular Road and another on Grangegorman Lower, close to the TU Dublin campus. The southside complex is the Tannery on Mill Street in the Liberties.The applications for the change of use stated that while students continued to live in the schemes, demand had “significantly declined” and the units could provide “an attractively priced alternative in the hospitality accommodation sector” or housing for “employees requiring accommodation on a temporary basis”. Student and non-student residences would be segregated within the development.Two-month restrictionThe council approved the use up to May 31st with a condition that short-term lets would be restricted to two months.However, Ms Sherlock said continuous short leases could turn student facilities into co-living developments and “dumping” so many additional beds into the tourism sector would have a crippling effect on hoteliers “already having to cope with a dramatic collapse in demand”. There was no evidence of any attempt to lower prices to attract more students she said.The Irish Hotels Federation said it had “serious concern” over any developments that could “undermine the viability of the hotel and guesthouse sector which has already been disproportionately impacted by Government restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic”.

spend big","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump: His team spent $11 million on a 60-second ad during the Super Bowl in February. Photograph: Saul Loeb “Can you donate $25 to make history?” That’s just one of the emails from Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris flooding into inboxes across the land, as candidates in the US election aim to shore up their cash position before next Tuesday’s election.Money has always been the oil that has helped fuel American politics. This year, experts are expecting fundraising figures to break records.“We are seeing a lot of money pour in,” says Ellen Weintraub, a commissioner at the Federal Election Commission. The Centre for Responsive Politics, an independent group which tracks money in US politics, estimates that $11 billion will be spent in the 2020 election – a record-breaking number. Approximately $6.5 billion was raised and spent in the 2016 election.The last decade or so has seen a fundamental shift in the way money is raised in US politics. The advent of the internet opened up new avenues for political candidates, and made it easier for ordinary donors to contribute to campaigns. Rather than open up their cheque-book, motivated voters could donate to their candidate of choice with a simple click of a mouse.ActBlue, a website based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has become the powerhouse of Democratic fundraising efforts. Most people who donate to candidates now do so via the ActBlue site. Republicans soon established their own version, WinRed, which allows people to donate using technology.But while technological advances have led to an increase in small-dollar donors – Joe Biden likes to say that his average donation is $43 – big-ticket contributors continue to play a major role.Though election fundraising and expenditure in the United States is highly regulated – candidates must report their finances to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and foreign iniduals and entities are banned from contributing to any candidate – there is still space for significant private money in the US electoral system.Legally, a candidate is only permitted to take $2,800 from an inidual (though they can accept $2,800 for a primary contest and the same amount for the general election). But additionally the Democratic and Republican committees can accept donations. They also run “segregated accounts” that can raise money. In addition, state party committees have their own fundraising capabilities. The result is that inidual donors can contribute to their choice of candidate through a variety of means.\u0026nbspBut it is the power of political action committees – or super pacs – that continues to exert an outsized influence on the US election. The committees can raise unlimited sums of money from big business, unions and iniduals. Although they are prohibited from contributing or co-ordinating with parties or candidates, they run political and election ads across the country.To take one example in South Carolina, where Republican incumbent Lindsey Graham is facing a strong challenge from Democrat Jaime Harrison, the Senate Leadership Fund – a super pac that aims to preserve and expand the Republican majority in the Senate – is running anti-Harrison ads.Super pacsEllen Weintraub of the Federal Election Commission explains that various court rulings, particularly the landmark supreme court “Citizens United” ruling of 2010 which allowed corporations and other donors to spend an unlimited money on elections based on the constitutional right to freedom of speech, have impacted on campaign finance laws.“I’m not a supreme court justice. I am merely a humble election commissioner, so I can only administer the law as it’s been interpreted by our supreme court,” she says, adding: “There’s a reason why the super pacs raise and spend so much money. It’s because there are no limits on how much money they can raise and spend, other than the fact that they too are not allowed to accept money from foreign nationals.”As election day approaches, TV and social media ads are blanketing news and internet channels across the country, particularly in swing states. Just as Biden is ahead in the polls, he is also well ahead in terms of fundraising.Recent figures from the FEC showed that the Democratic candidate began October with $177 million, compared with Trump’s $63.1 million. The Biden campaign has splashed on TV and other media ads and at least one innovative campaign spend – chartering an Amtrak train for a six-city tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, in a nod to Biden’s “Amtrak Joe” moniker after he spent years commuting to and from Washington from Delaware by train.Biden’s cash-rich position marks a big turnaround from earlier in the year. The Trump campaign, which began amassing a huge fundraising haul to finance a second-term campaign almost immediately after Trump was inaugurated, outpaced Biden in terms of fundraising as recently as the spring. But once Biden emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee the money came pouring in.Super Bowl adThe Trump campaign, in contrast, has already eaten into its significant cash pile this year, including dropping a cool $11 million on a 60-second ad during the Super Bowl in February, to compete with a similar ad by billionaire Mike Bloomberg, then a Democratic candidate.The Republican candidate may also be losing money to the Lincoln Project – a high-profile group of anti-Trump Republicans that has been running effective ads, including a controversial billboard campaign in Times Square featuring Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, which prompted threats of legal action from the couple. \u0026nbspThe Lincoln Project has raised about $60 million since launching late last year, though some of its fund may come from traditional Democratic supporters. \u0026nbspIn recent weeks there have been reports that the Trump campaign cut back on ad spending and cancelled campaigns, just as Biden ramps up spending in the final stretch of the campaign.But the campaign has hit back. This weekend, officials announced that $26 million was raised for the president in the hours after the final presidential debate. The campaign plans a heavy ad buy in Minnesota, a state that hasn’t voted for a Republican president since Richard Nixon in 1972 but which Republicans are hoping to flip.Officials also point out – correctly – that Trump was vastly outraised by Hillary Clinton in 2016 but still won the election.The president himself has also raised the issue in recent public appearances. During last Thursday’s debate he again claimed that he could raise “millions” from corporations and big-money donors if he just made a few calls, but to do so would mean he would be compromised. \u0026nbspInvesting in votesBiden’s big cash advantage has seen him plough money into the Republican-leaning state of Texas and invest heavily in Florida, thanks to a Bloomberg-run super pac. Whether it pays off will be revealed on election day.Whatever the result, this year’s election is a reminder of the role money plays in campaigning. As Fischer of the Campaign for Legal Reform notes, the impact of this level of money is not about corruption in the classic sense but about influence.“The impact of money in our political system very rarely manifests itself in political contributions in exchange for votes. Most voters and politicians are too sophisticated for that. What it does do is buy access and buy influence.“Contributions are made with the expectation that, down the road, the donor will be able to go back to the elected official and at a minimum get a meeting and be able to push their agenda, though not in so many words.”He adds: “Polls shows that the policy preferences of wealthy donors are different than the preferences of the US population as a whole.”More fundamentally, it also influences who runs for office in the United States.“In order to mount a viable campaign for office, a person needs to have a network of wealthy friends and associates who can support their campaign.“That has a limiting effect in the first instance about who can ever run for office.”Although a Democratic-controlled Congress may try to implement some reform of the campaign financing system, ultimately the courts may play a crucial role. As another justice is appointed to the supreme court, that is a reminder of what is at stake.Trump v Biden: who will prevail on November 3rd?

Thousands were arrested, and hundreds were later tortured in custody.The investigator, who did not wish to be named, quit five days later. “Everyone was appalled by the atrocities that were happening,” he said.“I would tell them, ‘There’s a solidarity chain outside. Let’s put on our uniforms and join in’, but everyone was too scared.”Belarus’ security services have inherited a rigid top-down hierarchy from their Soviet predecessors, as well as a high tolerance for violence and an intricate bureaucracy that discourages initiative, former security officials said.Mr Lukashenko has since tethered security officials to their jobs with financial tie-ins that make defections costly and highly complicated. Students at state-funded colleges (including police academies) have to work in a job designated by the state for at least two years unless they want to pay back as much as £10,000 in tuition fees, in a country where an average monthly pay is around £380.Security officials typically work on temporary contracts, and any early termination can set them back an equivalent of several thousand pounds.The 30-year-old criminal investigator from Minsk, who has a wife and a young child, had to pay back about £2,300 when he quit his job in August.Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 26 years, has made no secret of how crucial security services are to the survival of his regime.He spent two weeks before the elections touring military and police bases. In a highly symbolic gesture, he reportedly donated half of the potato harvest from his personal farm to riot police officers.Unlike their counterparts in Russia, law enforcement officers are generally well paid and have access to subsidised loans and housing.Reporting by The  as well as accounts in Belarusian media indicate that law enforcement officials typically make twice as much as the average Belarusian, with riot police receiving hefty bonuses for working overtime at protest rallies.For Yevgeny Babak, quitting his job as an assistant district prosecutor in Minsk was easier since he does not have a family to support.Mr Babak, 29, was on duty all day and night on August 9 and was receiving constant updates from a friend when the internet went dark across the country: police snatching passers-by, shooting rubber bullets, throwing stun grenades at unarmed protesters.Sitting at the district prosecutor’s office in Minsk’s north-east, Mr Babak and many of his colleagues openly cheered on the protesters to fight back. For several days, Mr Babak would leave work and stand with a group of demonstrators outside the metro station before heading home.As reports of police atrocities snowballed, the prosecutor’s staff kept on pressing their bosses: when can they investigate the blatant crimes everyone witnessed in the streets?Encouraged by his colleagues, Mr Babak filed a formal request for an investigation into a series of violent beatings of motorists in his district. When his request was stalled, he quit.Supervisors at the prosecutor’s office, the Investigative Committee and police stations have been holding “two minutes of hate” sessions for their employees since early this summer to mock opposition leaders and press the message of President Lukashenko, according to three security officials who were present at those meetings.In private, however, staff would make fun of those “political updates.”More than 700 security officials who quit in recent weeks have reached out to grass-roots initiative BySol which offers legal advice, training and financial aid to civil servants, security officers and workers at state-owned factories, said Andrei Strizhak, BySol’s co-founder.The actual number of the officers who have stepped down in protest is much higher, he believes. Belarusian news outlet Tut.by has reported several high-profile resignations at the Prosecutor General’s Office, including a senior prosecutor.The August atrocities have also taken a toll on officers’ families. Last week, the wife of a riot police officer who was pictured taking part in the August crackdown told local media that she orced him because she could not handle the hate messages she was receiving.A large number of security officials who “stay in the system are sabotaging its actions,” Mr Strizhak said, quoting recent leaks of personal data that named and shamed officers involved in police atrocities.Sympathetic officials inside the security apparatus have also helped a number of opposition figures and activists flee Belarus in time before they were formally charged and put on a wanted list, according to Mr Strizhak. Belarusian security services continue to carry out Lukashenko\u0027s orders.But protests have become a way of life for many in Belarus. Residential neighbourhoods have turned their local playgrounds into protest venues, students stage daily sit-ins during their lunch break, and the elderly march across Belarusian cities every Monday, chanting “Grandmas are with the people!”On Sunday, demonstrators flooded Minsk ahead of an ultimatum set by the opposition for Mr Lukashenko to leave office.Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on Mr Lukashenko to resign, halt violence and release political prisoners, warning he would otherwise face a crippling general strike on Monday.She set off last week with another member of the congregation, discussing whether it was better to take a shower curtain instead of a raincoat in case police use water cannons.The retired translator went to a pensioners’ anti-government march earlier this month and saw a stun grenade go off a few feet away after riot police tried to disperse the crowd of health care workers rallying nearby.“Going to the protests is scary but it’s not scarier than living with this violence” she said. “You can\u0027t feel safe anywhere now.”While protesters carry on marching in the streets and baking cakes, Mr Lukashenko and his security services insist that there can be no room for compromises, which, to some observers, makes the regime too fragile.“This system is too rigid to survive,” said Mr Strizhak of the BySol foundation. “If Lukashenko begins to make concessions, it’s going to fall in a flash.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrities must prove cant use public transport avoid driving","story":"Celebrities facing driving bans will have to prove they can\u0027t take public transport if they claim “exceptional hardship” in their bid to keep their licences, under new court rules.New sentencing guidelines stipulate that magistrates must have evidence from anyone facing a ban that other modes of transport are not viable before accepting any claim of “exceptional hardship” from disqualification.The move follows claims that the controversial defence of “exceptional hardship” to avoid a driving ban has been exploited by celebrities and other wealthy motorists with the money to hire expensive lawyers.Celebrities who have successfully used the defence include comedian Steve Coogan, the TV chef Tom Kerridge, former England cricket captain Andrew Flintoff, and pop star Gareth Gates.The most controversial, however, was a property millionaire facing a driving ban who said that having to hire chauffeurs would be an “exceptional hardship.”He claimed that during a previous ban he went through “five or six” drivers who would not pick him up during the anti-social hours he worked.The new sentencing council guidelines, which come into effect this month after a consultation, say magistrates must be strict about defining “exceptional hardship” for anyone facing a ban after totting up 12 or more points on their licence, irrespective of their wealth or background.They warn that a ban can\u0027t be an “inconvenience,” or simply “hardship,” but must be exceptional and the motorist must prove that on oath, and with evidence that meets the civil standard of proof, that is beyond the balance of probabilities.The guidelines acknowledge that everyone who is disqualified and their immediate families suffer hardship but tell magistrates that this is the “deterrent objective.”It extends to using the absence of alternative travel as an excuse.“Courts should be cautious before accepting assertions of exceptional hardship without evidence that alternatives (including alternative means of transport) for avoiding exceptional hardship are not viable,” said the guidelines.Some celebrities and singers who, like freelancers, can rely on short-term contracts for their earnings have managed to escape bans by claiming that being unable to drive could jeopardise these.However, the guidelines state: “Loss of employment will not in itself necessarily amount to exceptional hardship.“Whether or not it does will depend on the circumstances of the offender and the consequences of that loss of employment on the offender andor others.”Even the specialist motoring solicitor Nick Freeman, known as “Mr Loophole,” has called for the use of the defence to be tackled after it was revealed one unnamed driver from the west Midlands was still allowed to drive after clocking up 54 points on his licence.Mr Freeman who has successfully defended celebrity clients including Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Paddy McGuiness and Andrew Flintoff, has said it was inappropriate to allow the “exceptional hardship” defence when bundling together multiple offences.“There should be one exceptional hardship argument for one offence. What we have now is not a loophole. It’s bad law and it’s why the legislation sorely needs redrafting,” he said.\u0027If successfully argued, the offender is back on the road despite the vast number of points on his licence. \u0027It\u0027s so simple.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nasa definitively confirms water sunlit surface moon","story":"Nasa has confirmed for the first time that there is water on the sunlit surface of the Moon.The discovery opens up the possibility it could be used by humans setting up a lunar base to drink, or to manufacture rocket fuel for an eventual mission to Mars.Nasa scientist Casey Honniball said: To be clear, this is not puddles of water. It is water molecules so spread apart they do not form ice or liquid water. These water molecules are not interacting with each other.If we find the water is abundant enough in certain locations we may be able to use it as a resource for human exploration. It could be used as drinking water, breathable oxygen, and rocket fuel. Something is generating the water, and something must be trapping it there.The water molecules were present at about 100 to 400 parts per million, which was equivalent to a 12oz bottle of water spread across a cubic metre of lunar soil, she said.Paul Hertz, director of astrophysics at Nasa Headquarters in Washington, said: We had indications that H2O - the familiar water we know - might be present on the sunlit side of the Moon.Now we know it is there. This discovery challenges our understanding of the lunar surface.Until about a decade ago it had been thought the Moon was bone dry, but observations then indicated ice in permanently shadowed craters.A separate study released yesterday suggested 15,400 square miles of lunar terrain, including penny-sized nooks and crannies, could hold frozen water in cold traps. That was a much larger area than previously thought.It had been previously unclear whether molecules detected on the sunlit lunar surface were H20, or its close chemical relative hydroxyl, an ingredient in drain cleaner.Nasa said they had now definitively determined it to be water using observations from The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), a Boeing 747 jet equipped with a 106-inch diameter telescope.It was the first time SOFIA had been used to look at the Moon and it flew at 45,000ft over Nevada, while observing Clavius Crater in the Moon\u0027s southern hemisphere.Ms Honiball said: Prior to the SOFIA observations, we knew there was some kind of hydration. But we didn\u0027t know how much, if any, was actually water molecules - like we drink every day - or something more like drain cleaner.Nasa said there were several ways the water could have originated.One was that it arrived as part of micrometeorites, which on impact melted into what was described as glass beads.The water molecules were stored inside, protecting them from the harsh conditions on the lunar surface.Another possibility was that it could be hidden between grains of lunar soil, and sheltered from the sunlight, or it could have originated from past lunar volcanic eruptions.Nasa will in future use rovers with drills to see how much is under the surface, and expect they could find even more water there.The space agency\u0027s Artemis mission is intending to land the first woman and next man on the Moon in 2024, establishing a sustainable human presence by the end of the decade.The current destination is expected to be near the South Pole, but Nasa said the latest discovery could change that,Libby Jackson, UK Space Agency human exploration programme manager, said: Using a small amount of the Moon\u0027s natural resources could make it easier for astronauts to explore the Moon and the hope is that these pockets could be used to create drinking water and rocket fuel on the lunar surface.Paul Hayne, assistant professor of space physics at University of Colorado Boulder, who took part in the cold traps study, said: If you can imagine standing on the surface of the moon near one of its poles, you would see shadows all over the place. Many of those tiny shadows could be full of ice.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford covid vaccine produces strong immune response among elderly","story":"The Oxford University coronavirus vaccine produces a strong immune response among the elderly, the latest data shows.Analysis of the Phase II stage of the trial process reportedly found similar responses across all age groups, in findings that have been hailed as a milestone in the fight against the pandemic.It comes as Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said he expects a vaccine to be rolled out in the first half of next year, although he said it was possible some people could get access before New Year\u0027s Eve.While they face the highest risk from respiratory infections, elderly people often fail to mount a sufficiently robust response after being vaccinated due to their less active immune systems.In the field of influenza, this has forced authorities to commission a boosted adjuvanted vaccine in recent years designed specifically for pensioners, after the normal jab was found to be ineffective.Similar fears have dogged the development of a vaccine against Covid-19. However, on Monday both Oxford University and its industry partner AstraZeneca confirmed that the vaccine appears to boost both immunity in the form of antibodies and T-cells.The candidate drug is currently undergoing a much larger Phase III trial across several countries to try and establish how well it protects against coronavirus in a real-world setting.As part of a vastly accelerated logistics operation, doses of various candidate vaccines are already being manufactured, even before the results of final studies have been submitted for approval by regulators.A spokesman for the university said: These early results covering trial volunteers from the UK in the 56-69 and 70 plus age groups have been submitted to a peer-review journal, and we hope to see their publication in the coming weeks.Our ongoing trials will provide further data, but this marks a key milestone and reassures us that the vaccine is safe for use and induces strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system in all adult groups.AstraZeneca said it was encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults. The company also said it was pleased to see lower levels of side-effects in older adults.The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222, a spokesman said.The Phase II results have not yet been peer reviewed and published, but Professor Andrew Goddard, one of the architects of the vaccine, has discussed them at an academic conference.Earlier on Monday, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today Programme that the vaccine programme was progressing well.Asked how soon NHS staff could be injected with a vaccine, he said: Well, we\u0027re not there yet. We\u0027re in very close contact with the leading candidates. On my central expectation, I would expect the bulk of the rollout to be in the first half of next year.When asked if there could be some this year, he said: Well, I don\u0027t rule that out, but that is not my central expectation.Whilst promising that preparations were under way to roll out a vaccine as quickly as possible, Mr Hancock added: But, you know, preparing for a rollout and actually having the stuff to roll out are two different things.It\u0027s obviously something that we want to happen as soon as safely can be done and as fast as safely can be done, but we are not there yet.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pilot meant fly footballer emiliano sala britain pleads not","story":"David Henderson has pleaded not guilty to two charges relating to the aircraft crash which killed footballer Emiliano Sala in January 2019.Henderson, 66, was charged after the single-engine Piper Malibu aircraft crashed north of Guernsey in January 2019, killing its pilot David Ibbotson and passenger Sala.The body of the 28-year-old Argentinian, who was involved in a multimillion pound transfer from FC Nantes in France to Cardiff City FC, was recovered the following month, but the body of Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, has not been found.On Monday, Henderson, wearing a blue suit, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court via a video link to deny two offences under the Air Navigation Order (2016) brought by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The court heard he was charged with endangering the safety of an aircraft, as well as attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation.The court heard the details of the first allegation related to Ibbotson, who was contracted to fly the aircraft, not having a commercial pilot\u0027s licence at the time of the flight, with it having expired in November 2018.It also related to the bad weather which was forecast for the fatal return journey from Nantes to Cardiff, with the pilot not being competent to fly in such weather.Stephen Spence, defending, told the court he would raise the issue of whether Cardiff would be an appropriate venue for a fair trial, considering Sala\u0027s link with the Welsh capital\u0027s football club.Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke told Henderson his trial date had been fixed for October 18 2021.Henderson, from Hotham in the East Riding of Yorkshire, was granted unconditional bail until the trial date.A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) previously concluded that the aircraft carrying Sala and Ibbotson suffered an in-flight break-up while being flown too fast for its design limits, and that the pilot lost control while attempting to avoid bad weather.It added that Ibbotson was probably affected by carbon monoxide poisoning.Investigators found that a contributory factor in the crash was Ibbotson having no training in night flying, and a lack of recent practice in relying only on cockpit instruments to control a plane.And they found that he held a private pilot\u0027s licence that did not allow him to conduct flights for reward.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tanker captain had exemplary response suspected hijackers may","story":"The Greek captain of an oil tanker, which came under attack by suspected hijackers, locked himself in the bridge and maintained control of the vessel off the coast of the Isle of Wight for ten hours during the tense standoff.As seven stowaways ran amok on the 228-metre Nave Andromeda, allegedly threatening to kill the crew and overthrow the ship, the captain called authorities on an open radio channel pleading for immediate assistance, and kept the ship steady, allowing elite commandos could rappel down from helicopters and capture the suspects.The audio of his mayday call (see video below) has now been released, where he said he was trying to “keep them calm” but some of the intruders had climbed up five flights of stairs and were outside the ship\u0027s bridge.In heavily accented English, he said ... the stowaways go outside, I see four person port side, midship, near to the manifold, and I have two of them starboard side on the bridge, but cannot coming inside.I try to keep them calm but I need immediately, immediately agency assistance.The captain ordered the rest of his crew – made up of Greek officers and Filipino support workers – to a safe ‘citadel’ on board. The chief engineer, who is also from Greece, maintained his station in the engine room during the dramatic mission.When darkness fell, the captain switched off the lights and turned the tanker onto a westerly course, into the wind, to make it easier for the Wildcat and Merlin Mk 4 helicopters to hover.It is understood that the Royal Navy’s Special Boat Service team split in two and enacted a ‘pincer’ movement on the boat to trap the stowaways.They used dazzling lights to disorientate the men, who gave up their fight almost immediately. Reports claim they had sharpened objects or even knives. The operation lasted just nine minutes (see video below). The captain was lauded for his “exemplary response and calmness” in a “difficult” situation by the ship’s owners, Navios Tanker Management.The stowaways have been arrested on suspicion of seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force” and could face life sentences if charged and found guilty.However, there are fears that the suspected hijackers could seek political asylum in the UK now that they have made it to shore.Tony Smith, former director general of the Border Force, said he would be “very surprised” if the group did not claim asylum, but said law enforcement authorities needed to take a tough stance to deter others from taking similar action.“We have got to get the message out that stowing away is not going to work and you will find yourself in prison,” he said.The men are currently being held at police stations across Hampshire.The mission came just two weeks after more suspected Nigerian stowaways were found on an oil tanker coming out of Lagos.A remarkable picture (see below) shows three men sat on the rudder of the Norwegian tanker “Champion Pula” having spent ten days hiding just metres above the ship’s propellers.The ship was reportedly denied entry to the Canaries by Spanish authorities and after a two day stand off, it set course for Herøya, Norway, Bergens Tidende reported.“A Spanish boat put the headlights on the rudder, then we saw the men sitting there,” said Karl L. Kvalheim, CEO of Champion Tankers.They were brought on board and eventually arrested on October 17 by Norwegian authorities.“We will probably check our ships more thoroughly before they leave Nigeria from now on,” Mr Kvalheim added.The men suspected of sparking trouble on the Nave Andromeda could face a long legal battle to stay in the UK, but their deportation is not guaranteed.David Wood, director general of immigration enforcement at the Home Office until 2015, warned that even if the men were jailed for more than three years, they could still fight deportation under Article 3 of the Human Rights Act.“If you get a substantial term in prison, the human rights act allows for asylum status to be removed but it doesn’t overcome Article 3,” said Mr Wood.The other problem would be securing the consent of Nigeria to take the stowaways back once they had served any prison sentence, notwithstanding any Article 3 claim, added Mr Wood.“At the end of the day, they don’t say we are not taking these people back. They prevaricate,” he said. “They say, \u0027We are not satisfied that this person is Nigerian’ and don’t engage in any debate about it.”It comes as ministers attempt to counter a surge of migrants crossing the channel (see video below of migrants arriving on Kent beach in September) which have hit 7,500 already this year, almost four times the 1,900 in the whole of 2019.A number of deportation flights have been grounded by last minute appeals on human rights grounds.Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, is understood to be looking to curtail the use of Article 3, which has been exploited by murderers, rapists and other serious criminals. Strict limits will be placed on the types of asylum appeals which can rely on Article 3 as part of Ms Patel’s plans to fix what she claims is a “broken” asylum system.Two years ago, four migrants from Nigeria and Libya sparked trouble on a container ship during a 14-hour stand-off in the Thames Estuary in December 2018, waving metal poles and lobbing faeces, before claiming asylum in the UK.The group’s immigration status is due to be “reviewed” by the Border Force upon completion of their jail sentences.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"week planet normal now winter discontent","story":"The lockdown consensus is cracking. Until recently, to criticise anti-Covid restrictions was to be cast out from polite society. Those questioning conventional wisdom were “nutters” or “Trumpian” – selfish libertarians only out for themselves.When lockdown was first imposed in March, we worked from home and clapped for the NHS on our doorsteps – it was “only for a couple weeks”. Then restrictions were extended... but the weather was good, we saved money on train fares and so many were able to treat it as “family time”.The contrast with today’s lockdown is stark. The rule of six, and now this wildly incoherent three-tiered regional clampdown, is fuelling simmering discontent. The public is getting angry at what the political class is doing to them, and also with mainstream broadcasters who seem asleep on the job.Lockdown One (March to June) seemed broadly coherent. Deaths “from Covid” were rising, peaking at over one thousand a day. No-one knew how deadly this virus might be. The economy was suffering, yes, but the furlough scheme was generous, our public finances in reasonable shape and it made sense to “flatten the curve”.Lockdown Two (from September onwards) could hardly be more different. Daily coronavirus “cases” are four times higher than in April, but testing is up more than ten-fold. We now know the overwhelming majority of Covid fatalities are among the elderly with other life-threatening conditions – deaths “from” and “with” Covid aren’t the same. And almost everyone neither elderly, nor otherwise vulnerable, is either asymptomatic or recovers fast after minor symptoms.And yet here we are, compounding the steepest economic nosee in 300 years with more self-imposed damage. We’re banning events, hospitality, curtailing the arts, sport and countless other activities, crushing the untold numbers of firms that clung on through Lockdown One but are now throwing in the towel.But the trashed economy and decimated tax base is just the start of it. Because deep downturns – spiralling unemployment, related depression, despair and domestic abuse – cost lives. The ongoing go-slow of non-Covid NHS treatments – 1.2 million missed breast cancer scans, countless other life-saving operations delayed – costs lives.And what of children and students, almost entirely unaffected by the virus –  the precious education and youth of millions cruelly upended? And why this mind-numbing application of rules? Planet Normal listeners have wept at the plight of 83-year olds Robert and Josephine, teenage sweethearts turned life-long companions, she now with dementia in a care home, he forbidden to hug or even touch her.Then there’s the dying mother in Wales, “unable to choose” which of her four children should be her “sole permitted visitor” in her final days, so felt her only option was to opt to see none of them. What have we become?Back in September, government scientists warned of 50,000 new Covid cases daily by mid-October. The outcome was well under half that, despite much higher testing capacity – a fact broadcasters have barely reported. Total fatalities this month have been in line with the average over the last five years, before Covid – again, I’ve yet to hear that on the TV news.The occupancy of intensive care unit beds is just a fraction of what it was in early April, the peak of this pandemic – and that’s before we crank up now well-rehearsed emergency measures. ICU usage across the country is at 60 per cent, well below average, suggesting no danger that the NHS can’t cope.As the economic and human costs of lockdown escalate, the public is increasingly sceptical of “second wave” warnings. A lockdown imposed by well-heeled politicians and state-paid advisors is hitting poorer households hardest, not least those in cramped homes.In March, as the start of this Covid pandemic began, over 90 per cent of us backed lockdown. Now four in ten now say the rules do more harm than good – and that’s against a backdrop of government fearmongering, with many reluctant to speak their minds.Growing numbers of scientists now want age-specific shielding, with society helping the elderly and vulnerable take precautions if they want to, while the rest of us build immunity by getting on with our lives. Yet, amid scant evidence Covid causes any excess deaths, we have regional restrictions so isive there will soon be another national lockdown by default.Maureen Eames, an 83-year-old from Barnsley – who captured what many people were feeling when she said she “didn’t give a sod” about coronavirus rules, complained that Britain is supposed to be “a free country” and “life must go on” – is now a media sensation. Countless millions agree with her and must now find their collective voice. Join us on our metaphorical rocket of right thinking, our capsule of common sense, by listening to the Planet Normal podcast – out every Thursday. It’s free – at telegraphplanetnormal or via iTunes, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts“Dramatic” is how Anthony Bamford describes the impact of Covid restrictions on his business. The chairman of JCB – the iconic manufacturer of those ubiquitous yellow diggers ­– recalls what happened when much of the world entered lockdown earlier this year“We had around a billion and a half dollars’ worth of orders in early March, then almost nothing by the end of the month,” he recalls, appearing on the Planet Normal podcast. “That focuses the mind.”JCB is 75 years old this month, as is Bamford himself. He took over this thoroughbred British company from his father – Joseph Cyril Bamford – back in the mid-Seventies. Bamford Senior started out after World War Two, making agricultural trailers out of scrap metal salvaged from air-raid shelters. His son has turned a one-factory Staffordshire manufacturer of excavators into an empire, with 22 factories worldwide (half in the UK).Bamford sees signs of recovery. “Our markets in India and the US have remained remarkably strong,” he says. “Russia has also been a good market, Brazil, too – if a little fragile”. The desire by governments everywhere to keep economies going is now driving house building and infrastructure development. “Worldwide demand for our machines is rising – and is now back at the same sort of levels as this time last year,” he adds.A long-standing Conservative donor, Bamford says Boris Johnson is doing well in tough circumstances. “I don’t envy the Prime Minister one bit – going through this pandemic and negotiating with Europe at the same time,” he says.Bamford reckons “it looks like a Brexit deal will be done” but can’t be sure. After all, he says, “common sense doesn’t necessarily come into politics”.“Johnson is out of his depth - he can’t read data, has little feel for how science works, so doesn’t know which arguments to believe.” Andy “Maureen from Barnsley should be given immediate honorary citizenship of Planet Normal.” Stephen “This whole lockdownfire breakcircuit breaker thing has got out of hand.

Commissioned by the Department of Health, it is part of the largest piece of a research programme informing Government policies.Its findings showed that by June, after the first wave of the pandemic, just six per cent of the population had developed antibodies, which suggest some level of protection against the virus. Three months later, that figure had dropped to 4.4 per cent, with most of the decline happening within just six weeks. The sharpest fall was seen in those most in need of protection, with antibody levels among the over-75s reducing by close to 40 per cent between June and September. Scientists said the findings showed Britain is miles off achieving herd immunity, which they warned might never be reached without a vaccine. However, the research did not examine the role played by other forms of immunity. Some scientists believe the part played by T-cells – a type of white blood cell that helps the immune system fight off viruses and is linked with prior infections by common colds – could be more crucial in fighting the virus.Scientists analysed home fingerprick test samples from hundreds of thousands of adults to establish detectable antibody levels over a period of three months, and found levels fell by 26.5 per cent overall. The largest fall was among those most vulnerable to serious illness from Covid. Among those aged 75 and over, antibody levels fell by 39 per cent, while a drop of only 15 per cent was seen in those aged between 18 and 24.Researchers stressed that it is not yet known what level of antibody response is required to protect against reinfection – meaning it is possible that even levels of antibodies that were not found by the tests were offering some protection.  But they said the findings suggested a significant rapid decline in immunity, raising the prospect that those infected by Covid could suffer repeat infections in further waves.  The possibility that a vaccine may have to be administered as often as every six months increases the scale of the challenge ahead.  However, the researchers said vaccines may prove more powerful than natural immunity. On Monday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said the NHS and the Army were working on plans to roll out the vaccine programme as soon as a breakthrough is achieved. He said he expected the bulk of the rollout to occur in the first half of next year, although he had not ruled out the possibility that some jabs might be administered before Christmas. NHS workers are expected to be among the first to be offered vaccines. On Monday, the researchers warned that Britain is a long, long way from anything approaching herd immunity. Helen Ward, a professor of public health at Imperial and the lead researcher, said: I think what we are showing is that there is a really big challenge to that, which is that immunity is waning quite rapidly. After three months, we\u0027ve already shown a 26 per cent decline in antibodies.When you think that 95 out of 100 people are unlikely to be immune, and therefore likely to be susceptible, then we are a long, long way, from anything resembling a population level protection against transmission. Professor Wendy Barclay, the head of the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial, said the findings suggested Covid is likely to work in the same way as the common cold, meaning it can reinfect regularly. She said: Seasonal coronaviruses that circulate every winter and cause common colds can reinfect people after six to 12 months – and we suspect that the way that the body reacts to infection with this new coronavirus is rather similar to that. We don\u0027t yet know what level of antibody is needed in a person\u0027s blood to protect them from infection or reinfection from SARS-CoV-2,  but of course that level is a crucial thing to begin to understand. Most of the vaccine strategies are aiming to produce that level, and that level will feed into whether or not a population becomes immune or has any level of immunity.Prof Barclay warned that Britain was miles off herd immunity. Graham Cooke, professor of infectious diseases at Imperial, said: The big picture here is that, after the first wave, the great majority of the country still did not have evidence of protective immunity.So although we are seeing a decline in the proportion of people who are testing positive, we still have a great majority of people who are unlikely to have been exposed. So the need for a vaccine is still very large if you want to try and get a large level of protection in the population.People are starting to think about what we will need to do to boost vaccines periodically to keep levels of protection high, depending on what happens with those vaccines and what sort of strength of immune responses will be developed and how long they\u0027ll last for. The health minister Minister Lord Bethell said the study was a critical piece of research, helping us to understand the nature of Covid-19 antibodies over time and improve our understanding about the virus itself. He added: We rely on this kind of important research to inform our continued response to the disease, so we can continue to take the right action at the right time.

The inking is of a small child playing with a ball beneath a cherry tree. In the background is the neat terraced home where the England and Manchester United striker lived as a youngster. Children still play on the patch of the grass where he practised day and night and where his skills began to blossom. And in the surrounding houses, neighbours speak glowingly to the Mirror about the local boy made good who is now waging war on poverty. Kate Jenner, , lives in Marcus’ former family home with her we Lizzie, . The couple had no idea about the famous ex resident when they first moved in. Kate said: “We used to get taxi drivers dropping us off and they’d say ‘you live in Marcus Rashford’s old house’.” And she soon realised how much the down to earth footballer is admired in the community. The HR manager said: “People are aware he has got those roots in the local area and they increasingly ask about it, which is good. “His old primary school is just down the way and he visits there regularly. “And with all the work he has done recently with food vouchers for the kids, it has gone down really well around here.”Kate does not have children but thinks his campaign is “absolutely fantastic”. “It is a cracking thing and it is only right as far as I’m concerned. Parents should be able to put food on the table for their kids. “He recognises that some parents struggle to do that and they need some support. “If they are getting food vouchers in term time, why not extend that to make sure it is not a struggle for parents ” She added: “He is a good lad, he really is. He just gets it and he understands. We are not struggling to put food on the table but we absolutely understand that other people across the country are. He understands that. He has been brought up with that as his lived experience and wants to do what he can and use his voice and his influence to improve things for those that are struggling.” The house in Wythenshawe, Manchester, is owned by Marcus’ mum Melanie and he has ed on a couple of occasions for photo shoots, to the delight of residents. Next door but one lives Jan Garvey, , and her husband David, . And at the mere mention of his name, Jan reaches for one of her proudest possessions, a photo of her and Marcus leaning against the cherry tree. Jan said: “He has actually got a tattoo of that tree.”  And she added: “He is a fantastic man. Everybody around here is so proud of him. He is a lovely lad. “When we moved in Marcus had just moved out but he does come back and I had my photo taken with him in his England kit.” She added: “He was here with a film crew and he came, I think they were doing a documentary about him. “I went out and said ‘can I have my photo taken with you’.  “He was kicking a ball about with the local children on the front. “I think he is just wonderful. And he has not forgotten his roots.” Jan added: “He is a real inspiration for young people. It shows you can grow up around here andyou work hard you can do well. “He is a very kind person to do what he is doing. He does not to have to do it does he ” Jan is one of more than , people who have signed Rashford’s online petition demanding an expansion of the free school meal holiday scheme into next year. “I’m fully behind it. I’m very proud of him” she said.  And she smiled: “I think with Marcus and Andy Burnham, we can’t really complain around here.” Another neighbour, Anson Stephen, , used to watch the young Marcus kicking his ball for hours on end on the same turf where his two young sons, Jake, nine, and Dominic, five, now play. “He was very dedicated. Marcus always had a football, at night time, in the morning time. He was very focused on his football. “He was a very nice lad. All the family were lovely” he said.  Anson, a legal executive, also backs player’s efforts to help children across the UK. “My children do not have free school meals but I think it is a really good idea. “Marcus has experienced struggles so he understands what sort of struggles other children have and he is trying to do something that will really benefit them.” He added: “People around here are very proud of him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"covid infection rates should shown","story":"NewsCovid infection rates should be shown on weather bulletins, say expert groupEXCLUSIVE: Cross-party MPs are backing the new Covid-Secure UK plan, which aims to imitate New Zealand’s successful virus control strategymirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  OCT NewsInfection rates y across the UK, with Liverpool City Region the first area to be plunged into Tier  lockdown due to spiralling cases \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Broadcasters would be asked to display local infection rates on regular news and weather reports as part of a new blueprint for suppressing the virus. Cross-party MPs are backing a new Covid-Secure UK plan which aims to imitate New Zealand’s successful virus control strategy and end the cycle of lockdowns. The proposals include bolstering test and trace, widening screening to people in transport and other public facing roles and improving communication through regular No briefings and weather reports. Testing should be in place at UK entry points and transport hubs, with masks and sanitiser provided for free. Professor Martin McKee, a public health expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Independent SAGE, said: “The UK government’s approach is based on a  choice or ‘balance’ between saving lives and protecting jobs and the economy. “This has given us the worst of all worlds, with some of the highest death rates and greatest decline in GDP anywhere. “We are doing too little to break the chain of disease transmission while hitting people’s jobs and incomes.” He said the plan provided an “achievable alternative” for the UK. The move has also been backed by cross-party MPs, including Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, Tory MP Dr Dan Poulter, the SNPaposs Dr Philippa Whitford, Green MP Caroline Lucas MP and Labouraposs Clive Lewis.

So, aged , she started a charity to provide them with meals and toiletries.She didnapost ask who they were, how they voted, orthey were good parents. She just did what was needed to alleviate, a little, the problems of people she did not know. A sick child feeding anguished parents. A rich footballer pointing at child poverty. Both Emmie and Marcus Rashford, her fellow Pride of Britain award winner, are the sort of people who, in a crisis, look at the world and ask themselves how they can improve it for others.  And then we have the sort of people who look at a crisis and ask how they can improve it for themselves. Those who see a vote to feed hungry children as an attack on their right to feel successful. People who see a backlash against that vote as a political problem, rather than a moral one. The sort who, realising they are wrong, want things to look better, rather than be better.Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said the government had misunderstood the mood of the country. Former Childrenaposs Minister Tim Loughton said it was politically a mistake. And Mansfield MP Tory McTwatface said he was taken out of context when he agreed that food vouchers equated with £ a week on crack.It all rather ignores the fact that itaposs about morality, not mood people, not point-scoring and that food vouchers canapost be traded for drugs, for the simple reason that dealers can afford to feed themselves. Letaposs get this clear. Voting against feeding hungry children is a vote FOR making them go hungry. The money local authorities are using to plug the gap is cash that was intended for other hardships. The issue is not one of politics, or popularity, but about whataposs right and whataposs wrong.And to whinge about being taken out of context when even your excuses reek of an over-promoted adolescent with all the wit and personal charm of ear wax just makes it clear, to the world at large and your constituency voters in particular, that weaposd all be better offyou stood down to spend less time in your orices. Wonderingto feed children during school holidays is not about subbing irresponsible parents, or crackheads, or paying for other peopleaposs lestyle choices. Itaposs about why, exactly, anyone has to wonder about it. Itaposs about MPs who just voted themselves a rise to £, giving the equivalent of . minutesapos worth of those earnings to the kids who in the years to come will have to pay for their bad policies.Itaposs about parents furloughed on % pay through no fault of their own having to pay % of the rent, council tax, and fuel bills and suddenly finding thereaposs little left for anything . Itaposs about millions of working families who were already struggling on a minimum wage of £. an hour, or £. for a full dayaposs work, with the prospect of getting just £. a day on the dole. Itaposs about the fact those people in this crisis are more likely to be mums, or pregnant, or young, or nearing retirement.A furloughed minimum-wage mum gets just £. an hour. An MP gets  times that, infor screwing her over. And sheaposd have to wait  years to earn the £, her Prime Minister once described as chicken feed. If that mum got a £ food voucher, sheaposd have £. a day to feed her child. Over a week, that might stretch to a bag of frozen chicken nuggets, a packet of Weetabix,  pints of milk, and some wonky veg. A child would still be malnourished on that, still lose weight, still risk growing up a little wonky themselves, but itaposs better than nothing. It is equivalent to less than half of the £. pan-seared mackerel with heritage tomato ceviche, elderflower gel, horseradish and charred cucumber available as a starter in the MPsapos subsidised dining room. The vote they held was the same as asking themselves whether theyaposd be prepared to allow just one forkful of their mini sirloin of beef, with mini steak and kidney pudding, roasted baby carrots, savoy cabbage and potato terrinefind its way into the mouth of a skinny -year-old. And the debate theyaposre having now is no dferent to asking themselves, before they do so, whether that childaposs parents are virtuous enough to merit their offspring receiving this square mouthful of charity. Those who question whether the poor should get help do so because they fear it will move the poor a little closer to them. Societyaposs isions are beneficial,your sense of self-worth comes from the belief you are doing better than others. Alleviating hunger means there is less space in which to be such an arsehole. Confronted with widespread anger over ordering his MPs to vote against feeding vulnerable children, Boris Johnson is not slapping his head and saying Gadzooks! If only Iaposd known! Heaposs delaying the u-turn until he can find a way to blame Rishi Sunak for it, and Rishi is probably delaying Treasury agreement until he can blame someone . So when that u-turn comes, it wonapost be because the government realised it was wrong. It will be because the likes of Marcus Rashford - and the thousands of people nationwide now offering their own neighbours and customers a packed lunch for youngsters - embarrassed them. They have not, unfortunately, managed to educate them.

She said she wanted to set the record straight, adding: I’m not speaking out for the first time to dismiss the fact that antisemitism reared its head among a small minority in the Labour party. It did. It was wrong and the party as a whole was slow to deal with it effectively. That failure, combined with a relentless and highly politicised media campaign had a serious impact: it hurt Jewish people and disturbed and confused many in our movement. Could more have been done earlier  Yes, of course. But what was done – including changes to the party’s rules and instituting detailed guidance on antisemitism for an expanded complaints team – unquestionably made it easier and swter to remove antisemites from the party."},{"url":null,"title":"obama campaign manager says joe","story":"NewsObama campaign manager says Joe Biden doing better than they were in David Plouffe, who helped engineer Obamas historic victory in , said of Bidens poll lead: \"Its real.\"mirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  OCT NewsObama campaign chief stratagist David Axelrodand campaign manager David Plouffe\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The supermarket giant told a Twitter user who was refused sanitary pads that we have been told by the Welsh Government not to sell these items. But it rowed back minutes later after the Welsh Government made clear sanitary pads and tampons are allowed - along with anything  normally sold in a pharmacy. Tesco apologised and agreed tampons could be sold after all. The supermarket giant confirmed the tampons aisle had been cordoned off in one store in St Mellons, Cardf, which appeared to have sparked the row. However, Tesco said the aisle was cordoned off due to police investigating a break-in, not perceived government rules, and it was an isolated incident. It comes as Walesapos Labour government faces mounting anger over the non-essential goods policy during a two-and-a-half-week aposfire-breakapos lockdown. Non-essential shops in Wales have been closed like in the first UK-wide lockdown in March. But unlike the first lockdown, shops that remain open have been explicitly banned from selling non-essential goods. That prompted supermarkets across Wales to put up barriers and plastic screening across forbidden products. The policy prompted a storm with critics saying it would drive people into web giants like Amazon, and be impossible for small corner shops to enforce.  Meanwhile baby clothes in supermarkets have been screened from view while alcohol continues to be sold freely. Walesapos Health Minister could mount a U-turn when he gives a press conference at .pm today. The latest row erupted when Twitter user @kt complained to Tesco.  She said: “Can you explain why I was told today that I can’t buy PERIOD PADS as I’m sure they are essential to women !!! “But I can buy alcohol it doesn’t make sense”. Tesco replied: “Hi Katie. We understand how frustrating these changes will be for our Welsh customers. “However, we have been told by the Welsh Government not to sell these items for the duration of the firebreak lockdown.” The Welsh government then intervened on Twitter, saying: This is wrong - period products are essential. Supermarkets can still sell items that can be sold in pharmacies. Only selling essential items during firebreak is to discourage spending more time than necessary in shops. It should not stop you accessing items that you need. Welsh government guidance says supermarkets and other big stores can continue to sell goods that would be available in the following:food and drink retailersnewsagents building supplies and hardware stores pharmacies and chemists bicycle shops petrol stations garages and vehicle hire businesses post offices, banks, building societies and similar pet shops agricultural and aquacultural supplies shops and livestock markets and auctionsTesco later tweeted: Good Morning Katie - thanks for getting in touch and please accept my apologies for the confusion caused by my colleaguesapos earlier reply. This is a response weaposre using when challenged on products that we have been asked to restrict by the Welsh government. However, clearly sanitary products are an essential purchase and Iaposm so sorry to see that one of our stores has them restricted at the moment. Can you please DM us to let me know when you were in store and which store this was, so I can look in to this further. A Tesco spokesperson said: “Of course sanitary products are essential items and are available to customers in all of our stores, including those in Wales.

Warrington will become the fourth area of England to join Tier  at midnight tonight, with pubs and bars forced to shut in the town of , people. And parts of Nottinghamshirewill change to the highest alert level on Thursday after local leaders met the government this afternoon. Meanwhile, Tier  talks are ongoing with West Yorkshire , and were reopened with the North Eastbut the status is unclear. Leaders in the North East said on Monday that they would resist moves to Tier . The government finally confirmed Warrington will enter Tier  this afternoon, days after the news was confirmed by MPs and the council. Pubs and bars will be forced to shut unless they can operate as a restaurant, and can only serve alcohol with “substantial” meals.People will be banned from meeting those not in their household or bubble, either indoors or in private outdoor spaces like gardens. Travel in and out of the area will be advised against in the restrictions, which last  days before a review. And on top of normal Tier  rules, betting and gaming shops, casinos and soft play centres in Warrington must shut. The change means .million people are now in Tier  in Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Warrington. Parts of Nottinghamshire will become the fth region to enter a Tier  lockdown this week, meaning .million people will be under the tightest restrictions. A further .million are in Tier  lockdown. Nottingham City Council confirmed that Nottingham, Broxtowe, Gedling and Rushclfe Council areas would be placed under the toughest restrictions at midnight on Thursday. Further measures specic to these areas of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire will be announced tomorrow. Council leaders in Nottinghamshire had been pushing for a decision on entering Tier  today. But sources said talks hit a road-block over the decision to involve just four of the county’s eight boroughs - Nottingham, Gedling, Broxtowe and Rushclfe. Talks last week were thought to have focused on those boroughs but since then infection rates in three of the other four areas - Mansfield, Ashfield and Bassetlaw - have been “rising by the minute”, a local source said. Yet the councils for those areas were not involved in the initial talks. The eighth borough is Newark - constituency of the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick who has led Tier  lockdown talks.  Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood said case rates were falling in the city and rising where in the county. She said she had had no formal meetings since Friday and was trying to figure out why talks were dragging on so long. She told the Mirror: “I’m a bit in the dark,I’m brutally honest. I don’t really understand why - it didn’t seem like there was much to discuss when I spoke to them on Friday. So I don’t know what’s changed.” Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome said local officials had been “asked to sign last-minute agreements” to enter Tier , without knowing what funding they’ll get. She told the Nottingham Post: “Nottingham City Council has already had to spend more than £m from its own reserves to cover the cost of the pandemic. After years of cuts, council budgets are already badly overstretched and this canapost go on for any longer.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tier 3 lockdown rules what","story":"NewsTier  lockdown rules: What you can and cant do in very high risk areasWarrington and parts of Nottinghamshire are entering Tier  lockdown restrictions.

Local leaders in the Cheshire town have agreed for Warrington to move to the aposvery highapos alert level from . on Tuesday. They will be followed by parts of Nottinghamshire  hours later. The Government moved to a three-tier lockdown system earlier this month. Officially called the Local Covid Alert Levels, it has placed every village, town, city and region into one of three tiers. The lowest level is Tier  , Tier  is high risk while Tier  - the highest with the most severe restrictions - is very high. Liverpool was the first area of England to be hurled into Tier  restrictions on October , and they were joined a few days later by Lancashire. Now, Manchester has been plunged into the most severe level, with restrictions taking hold from Friday, and South Yorkshire will follow suit  hours later. It means a total of .million people will be living with Englandaposs most severe restrictions from Saturday. Local leaders, Public Health England and the Joint Biosecurity Centre will work out when areas will move from one tier to another. Previously they have looked at the growth rate of the disease and number of people in hospital, as well as infection levels. Measures will be reviewed every four weeks, the three-tiered system expected to remain in place for six months. A new online postcode checker has been provided by the Government, allowing people to check their local restrictions. Tier  lockdown rules The government will set a baseline of the minimum measures that need to be in place in any areas that go into Tier . These measures include: Pubs Pubs and bars will close unless they can operate as a restaurant and serve substantial meals. Alcohol can only be servedit’s with a main lunchtime or evening meal. Bags of crisps or nuts are unlikely to count as a substantial meal. Officials in Liverpool confirmed to the Mirror that pubs that serve substantial meals will be allowed to remain open in the city.  Social mixing People living in an area that goes into Tier  cannot mix inside at all, including private homes or any kind of hospitality or ticketed venue. The same goes for meeting in private domestic and beer gardens. The only place people can see friends, family and anyone  outside their household or social bubble is in an open public space, such as a park, forest or beach. In these areas, the Rule of Six still applies. Support bubbles remain in the top tier, allowing people to meet those who are part of their extended household. Wedding receptions Wedding receptions are not allowed in towns and cities placed into Tier  restrictions. Travel The number of journeys inside a Tier  area should be kept to a minimum. Travel in and out of the area will be advised against, but not illegal, with the government advising against leaving or entering aposvery highapos risk areas. However travelling for work, education, accessing youth services, to meet caring responsibilities orthey are in transit, is allowed. The Government also says overnight stays in other parts of the country should also be avoided. That means anyone living in a Tier  area shouldnapost stay where, and people from other parts of the country should stay over in a aposvery highapos risk town. Bespoke additional measures The Governmentaposs chief scientists - including Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - have said that the baseline measures on their own would not be enough to get the all-important R-rate down to an acceptable level. However, each area can negotiate additional measures on top of the baseline. Warrington: On top of the baseline measures, betting and gaming shops, casinos and soft play centres must shut. South Yorkshire: Soft play centres, betting shops, casinos and adult gaming centres will be closed. Leisure centres and gyms will remain open, however organised fitness classes will not take place while Tier  restrictions are in place. Manchester: Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres, and soft play areas will all close in Greater Manchester while the region is in Tier . Lancashire: Adult gaming industry, casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers and betting shops and soft play areas are closed in Lancashire as well. Care boot sales are not permitted. Gyms and leisure centres can remain open. Liverpool: After initially being told they must close, gyms and leisure centres in the Liverpool region will be able to reopen later this week. Soft play areas can remain open, and car boot sales can continue. As in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, adult gaming centres, casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers and betting shops are also closed. Tier  shielding For anyone in a aposvery highapos risk area who was previously shielding, extra advice has been issued. People are encouraged to work from home and stay at home as much as possible, only traveling when itaposs essential. However, people can still go to workthataposs not possible, and children can still go to school. Shopping trips should be signicantly reduced and replaced with online deliveries or people in your household, support bubble or volunteers collecting food and medicines where possible. Those who had to shield before are also encouraged to go outside for exercise. A small number of people may need additional support, and are advised to contact their local authoritythey need assistance.

Research by Imperial College London estimated just .% of adults had some form of immunity against Covid- in September, when cases began to increase again. This is compared with % found to have antibodies between June  and July , and .% between July  and August . The number of people with antibodies fell by . per cent over three months, according to research commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care. The study involved more than , randomly selected adults in England who used finger prick antibody tests at home. Between  June and  September, the proportion of people who tested positive for antibodies dropped from six per cent of the population to . per cent. This suggests antibodies reduce in the weeks or months after a person is infected, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Health Minister Lord Bethell said the study made it clear people are not immune from coronavirus just because they have tested positive for antibodies.He added: “This study led by Imperial and Ipsos MORI is a critical piece of research, helping us to understand the nature of COVID- antibodies over time, and improve our understanding about the virus itself.We rely on this kind of important research to inform our continued response to the disease, so we can continue to take the right action at the right time. “It is also important that everyone knows what this means for them – this study will help in our fight against the virus, but testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to COVID-.“Regardless of the result of an antibody test, everyone must continue to comply with government guidelines including social distancing, self-isolating and getting a testyou have symptoms and always remember Hands, Face, Space.”  Antibody responses also appear to y over time depending on a person’s age and symptoms. The study suggested that people who did not show Covid- symptoms are likely to lose detectable antibodies sooner than those who had signs of the disease. The findings also show the loss of antibodies was slower in  to -year-olds compared with those aged  and over. Professor Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme, said: “Our study shows that over time there is reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-. It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts.  If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab testthey have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required.” Helen Ward, one of the lead authors of the antibody report, said: “This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time. We don’t yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others.” The study results indicate the first wave of the epidemic took place over a short period in March and April.  It appears there was then a steep decline in the proportion of people who reported having Covid- symptoms and who tested positive for antibodies from early April - two weeks after national lockdown. While positive antibody tests declined in the general population, the number of health workers who tested positive for them did not change. Researchers believe this could be because of higher initial or repeated exposure. There was a decline in positive antibody tests in people across all age groups, although the smallest was among people aged between  to  years.

This comes as Tesco was embroiled in controversy over its classing of non-essential items.A man who was spotted shopping in his underwear around Tesco in Newport, Wales, said he did so to prove something is essential to everyone. While Tesco apologised on Monday after wrongly saying it canapost sell tampons in Wales.Stephen started his own protest today while his we Joanne, , was upstairs looking after their two daughters when he raided the fruit bowl and taped the bunch of three bananas to his crotch. In the clip, the -year-old can be seen stood on a work trestle with his tools in hand. He appears to pause his plastering to speak to the camera, with only the bananas covering his manhood. Stephen then proclaims that he blames the embarrassing outfit on the First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford, in reference to the uproar over what items were classed as “non-essential”. The video has since been viewed , times and shared more than , times, with , reactions - as he warned viewers “no close-ups”. Stephen, from Aberdare, Wales, said: The non-essential thing has gone crazy really - I hope the government turn around a bit. I thought Iaposd try and put a smile on peopleaposs faces and make a funny video. I didnapost want to go down the political road. My we was upstairs trying to get the kids out of bed because theyaposd had a lie in and I had the idea in my head before I told her. She came down the stairs and I had these bananas strapped to me. She said aposwhat the hell - youaposre crackersapos. Bananas were the only thing I could find really. I restricted myself with a bit of tape and I couldnapost use any other fruit because I didnapost have any. All my clothes were in the wash and I had my shorts on. I thought Iaposd have a bit of fun, whipped the shorts off and stuck the bananas on. I couldnapost have bought any replacements and my clothes were in the wash.  I had a bit of pain taking it off though because it was stuck to the hairs on my legs. Since going viral, Stephen claims he has been stopped in the street while his friends on the buildersapos yard also joked about the video. Stephen said: I didnapost think the video would take off as well as it did.

The Shih Tzu was found abandoned in a cemetery by a shocked member of the public near Bury, Greater Manchester, on Sunday. Her badly matted fur was so overgrown that she was unable to see and had caused a gruesome infection in one of her eyes. A grim photo shows her left eyeball protruding from its socket. The woman who found the animal, thought to be ten years old, took her to a vet and RSPCA inspector Demi Hodby was sent to the scene.The animal charity, which has named the pooch Boo ahead of Halloween, is appealing for information about who might have dumped her.Boo was given emergency treatment at the vets then taken to Greater Manchester Animal Hospital for further treatment. Her eye was so severely infected that she had to undergo an operation to have it removed. Now Boo is recuperating from her ordeal in RSPCA care, as an investigation to trace the person responsible for abandoning her begins. Demi said: Poor Boo was so terried she was trembling and was in a terrible condition. She couldnapost see anything because she was blind in the infected eye and the other one was covered in matts.  She couldnapost see where she was going and was frightened when anyone went near her. Her eye was so swollen and badly infected it was bulging from her head and must have caused her a lot of pain and suffering. There was also crusting round her face from where the infection was coming from her eye. But following treatment Boo seems to be making good progress and when she is fully rehabilitated we will be able to look for a new home for her. Shannon McCall, the vet who treated Boo at GMAH, said: Boo came into our care in a state of neglect.  She had suffered an injury to her eye that was traumatic in nature, her entire eye was prolapsed out of her head and she had no vision left in it. There was a lot of bruising and blood around the eye and it was very swollen and painful. The other eye was also severely infected. The condition of her coat was dreadful, with lots of matts present and she had an underlying skin infection. Her nails were very long and had started to curl into her pads.

Earlier this month Julie Cooper, who runs The Don bar in Stockton, County Durham started to feel seriously run down and began to have dficulties breathing. The -year-old was forced to stay overnight at the University Hospital of North Tees when she struggled to take in air, Teesside Live reported. Julie, who hopes to open a new pub, The Last Post, on Rembrance Sunday, said the virus is the worst thing she has ever had to contend with. She said: Itaposs frightening, you donapost know whether you are going to get through it. I have been in bed for nine days. I have got quite a high pain threshold so it really has hit me. I canapost breath and when I get out of bed I feel faint. When I manage to get to the toilet, I have coughing fits and I canapost breathe. Itaposs like you feel yourself suffocating and you canapost do anything about it. Itaposs an awful feeling. Youaposre just there for hours and hours on your own trying to breathe. You either get better or you get worse and end up in intensive care. You just have to sit and wait, thataposs all you can do. Julie, who suffers from bronchitis, believes she may have contracted coronavirus from somebody who came into her bar.  During the first few days of her illness she called for an ambulance twice because she could not breath. The first time the ambulance arrived she was told she was not ill enough to be taken to hospital. The following day she was forced to call them again and was transported to University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton. While staying at the hospital overnight, she underwent tests and was found to have a shadow on her lungs. Julie said: When the ambulance man first came out he wished me good luck. I thought aposoh god, is that itapos. Itaposs true - thereaposs nothing they can do about it. They havenapost got a cure for it. They canapost give you oxygen unless your body is ready for it. It can do you more damage than good. When I was on the ward with coronavirus patients it was very quiet and very serious. There was nobody talking, most of them had masks on.

For example, there is a new list of items we’ll need to declare when travelling to and from Europe. To keep us in line with CITES, an international agreement that protects endangered animals and plants, permits will be needed to move protected species between Great Britain and the EU, and between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, from January , . All species of animals and plants listed under CITES will need a CITES permit and or an import notication. Here are some items to look out for:Guitars  Guitar – it could be made using protected wood such as rosewood. Exotic pets Exotic pets – animals such as parrots and tortoises will need a CITES permit. Taxidermy  Taxidermy – dead animals can be protected under CITES too. Orchids and cacti Orchids and cacti – some types will need a certicate to move in or out of the country. Antique jewellery  Antique jewellery – check that necklace from your nan doesn’t contain ivory, tortoiseshell or coral: you might need a permit just to bring it on holiday. Skin cream Skin cream – even low-end brands can contain caviar, which means you’ll need CITES documentation to take them in or out of the UK. Other personal items Check out items such as jewellery boxes or photo frames: these items and furniture might be made with materials like rosewood, and buying it from abroad or selling it on could mean you need to apply for CITES documentation.

An extensive study by scientists at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine unearthed widespread disregard for the government rules.Two thirds of the thousands of people they spoke to said the rule of six - designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus - had limited their social movements.A quarter admitted that they had actually seen more people on average every day since the rule came into force. Overall the rule of six had zero effect on the number of social contacts for the group as a whole, the study found. The pm curfew was also judged to be largely redundant by the scientists. While it had made some people reduce their contacts, their efforts had been cancelled out by others increasing theirs. If neither policy is stopping house-to-household mixing, then they are likely failing to slow the pace of the diseaseaposs spread. Contrastingly, local lockdowns do seem to have had an impact on peopleaposs socialising. On average measures introduced regionally, such as pub closures, have led people to reduce their social contacts by less than one each per day. However, the full national lockdown which began in March reduced the average daily contacts from about . to .. We determine that the ‘rule of six’ and encouraging people to work from home has seen the average person reduce contacts but these reductions are likely small, part of the paper reads. There was little suggestion that the pm closure has affected the number of contacts that participants make outside home, work and school. In contrast to national restrictions, there was a strong suggestion that local restrictions reduced the number of contacts iniduals make outside of work and school, though again, this effect was small in comparison to the national lockdown.

It comes after the SBS stormed oil tanker Nave Andromeda off the south coast on Sunday to tackle seven violent stowaways. The Mirror can reveal refugees are ghosting on to boats on inland waterways – adding to the risk of terrorists travelling to Britain through people-smuggling routes. A security source said of the Nave Andromeda raid: “Special forces have been practising for an event like this for many years but lately their training has increased as it is thought to be only a matter of time before there is a more serious taking of a ship, possibly by terrorists. Were you affected by the oil tanker incident at the weekend  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story “The Nave And­­romeda mission was textbook and a huge success but the worry was there was a chance it could have been more sinister than an attempt by illegals. “From the moment news broke that a ship may have hostile illegals on board it was always going to become an armed counter-terror mission, just in case. “With limited information coming from the ship at the time the Home Office realised it had to end the stalemate and deploy the SBS to retake the ship.  It ended well butthey had been armed or carrying explosives it would have been a very ­high-risk operation.” The Nave Andromeda ­stow-­­­­­­ aways had apparently boarded in Lagos, Nigeria, where a group with links to Islamic State has grown in recent years. After a -hour stand-off the Home Secretary agreed to hand over to the military and the SBS used five helicopters and rapid attack boats to retake the tanker off the Isle of Wight.  Hampshire Police arrested all seven stowaways “on suspicion of seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force under the Aviation and Maritime and Security Act ”. And we can reveal four migrants were also taken off a cargo ship near Brighton on Thursday after boarding in Rouen, France, a port  miles inland. The craft, called Alessandra Lehmann, sailed along the Seine river into the open sea and the ­stowaways were only spotted when it reached the UK.  The group were then taken to a police station. Thousands of migrants have crossed the Channel in flimsy dinghies this summer but this is thought to be one of the first times on which a group boarded a ship inland to get here. Asked for a response to the Alessandra Lehmann incident, the Home Office said: “We are fixing our broken asylum system. An asylum system should provide safe haven to those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny."},{"url":null,"title":"three areas facing tier 3","story":"NewsThree areas facing Tier  restrictions where Covid infections are falling - full listNottingham enters Tier  restrictions on Thursday but has seen its rate of new infections fall, while hard-hit Liverpool and Knowsley also saw new Covid- cases dropmirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByJoe GammieJoseph WilkesReporter:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start inCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-news-headlines-more-areas-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

She told the Mirror: “I’m a bit in the dark,I’m brutally honest. I don’t really understand why - it didn’t seem like there was much to discuss when I spoke to them on Friday. So I don’t know what’s changed.” Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome said local officials had been “asked to sign last-minute agreements” to enter Tier , without knowing what funding they’ll get. She told the Nottingham Post: “Nottingham City Council has already had to spend more than £m from its own reserves to cover the cost of the pandemic.

The same experimental treatment was given to Trump when he was hospitalised in Washington earlier this month, Wales Online reported. The US President was released a few days later. Mrs James received the transfusion as part of the Randomised Evaluation of Covid- Therapyclinical trial. She is now recovering at home. Mrs James said she was breathless and receiving oxygen at the point when she received the transfusion, but then her symptoms started to improve. “There was never any doubt in my mind about taking part in this research trial,” she said. “I felt very poorly and had deteriorated very quickly, and I wanted to get better and to help other people to get better. We’re in the dark about Covid- and I wanted to give something back. Mrs James praised the care she received and how thoroughly informed she had been prior to the treatment being started.  Everyone was so caring and kind so it made me feel really pleased to take part in the research, she continued. “I started to feel better the day after the transfusion, and I only had a small amount of oxygen during that night. Although I’m still recovering, I already feel much better than I did a week ago.”The aim of the trial, which is the world’s largest randomised controlled clinical trial in the battle against coronavirus, is to discover the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies.Scientists hope they can prevent Covid- from entering humans cells in a bid to stop them becoming seriously ill. Cardf and Vale University Health Board has played a signicant part in the trial and since March it has recruited  patients to it. Dr Stuart Walker, executive medical director of Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: “Our research teams have made an outstanding contribution throughout the Covid- pandemic, and I would like to commend their efforts in implementing this trial so proactively.

It is a syndrome found in children under  around three weeks after they contract coronavirus. Rachelle told KAMC  she knew something really wasnapost right with Zechariah before taking him to University Medical Center on October , where he spent five days in an ICU ward after suffering heart failure.  Every single organ had inflammation in it, she said. They were all enlarged so the heart stopped because the heart couldn’t pump right.

Thankfully, the weekendaposs change is the good one - meaning we got an extra hour kip rather than hearing that dreaded alarm clock even earlier as we do in the spring. But for some it plays havoc with their bedtime routine, and can leave them struggling to nod off or wake up for days. In a bid to tackle this, the clever people at blind and curtain company Hillaryaposs have come up with a calculator which works out exactly what time you need to go to bed depending on what time you need to wake up the next morning. We sleep in -minute cycles, and we should aim to get either five or six of these cycles every night. While the extra hour means itaposs likely weaposll get an extra cycle, it can confuse our bodies and they have to get used to the extra sleep - which sometimes leaves us feeling sluggish. The companyaposs sleep expert, Lucy Askew, tells : It is so important to get a good night’s sleep as this can really affect how youthe next day. Getting decent sleep helps with your productivity, concentration levels and your cognition so it affects almost every aspect of your le. Not only this, but sleep can lower your risk of things like heart disease, helps keep your immune system strong and it is vital for supporting your mental wellbeing.  Lack of sleep has a bigger impact on your health than you may realise. Not only can it affect the way youthe next day, but it can also change your appearance and age your skin quicker. Being sleep deprived can also cause your skin to break out. More serious health problems associated with not getting enough sleep include high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attacks. There are also studies that link not getting enough shut eye with depression.

Poveglia Island, off the coast of Venice and Lido, Italy, was used as a quarantine station for people with the killer disease. People were dragged kicking and screaming to the islandthey showed even the slightest symptoms of the Black Death, according to legend. The -acre plot was also used as a mass burial ground where some , victims are thought to have been burned to stop the spread of the disease. And it has been said that even to this day, human ash from these cremations make up more than % of the islands soil. Now British urban explorers Matt Nadin, , and Andy Thompson, , have shared the extraordinary footage after sneaking into the most remote parts of the island. The video shows a former psychiatric hospital where gruesome experiments, including lobotomies, were alleged to have taken place in the s. A doctor at the hospital eventually committed suicide by throwing himself from the iconic bell tower. The incredible footage also shows the rotting abandoned buildings and vast mass burial ground and items, including old beds and baths, as well as several large containers which look like they may have been used to burn bodies. Matt, a salesman from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, posted the extraordinary footage to his You Tube channel, Finders Beepers History Seekers, where he can often be found exploring abandoned and historic places of interest with Andy. He said: It was really, really eerie.  You could tell even the taxi driver was scared, not just of the police but of the place itself, he couldnapost get away quick enough. The island is so full of dark, dark history, a hell of a lot of people died there and you really get a sense of the horrors that took place there while youaposre walking around. They burnt all the bodies and left them where they lay. The island has never really been cleared properly or anything so everything has just been left. Later on, when it was turned into an asylum, because people were shoved there out of the way of prying eyes, they started to do experiments on them, horrible, horrible stuff.Whilst we were there, we heard the bell toll and that was quite spooky, that did actually freak me out a little bit. It was like an omen or something. The whole place was just really weird and eerie although you could tell from the tiles and the archways it would have been a beautul building originally.

Incoming were goalie Calum Ferrie, midfielders Shaun Byrne and Declan McDaid and attackers Danny Mullen and Jonathan Afolabi.Jack Hamilton, Paul McGowan and Fin Robertson dropped to the bench while Osman Sow missed out completely and Jordon Forster has broken a bone in his foot.Captaining Ton was former Dee favourite Jim McAlister.Last week, Dundee were behind after three minutes. This week they were ahead in five as Afolabi marked his first start with a goal.After McDaid#s cross was headed out, Jordan Marshall worked his way down the left before crossing low for the Celtic loanee to smash home.Afolabi almost added a second on  minutes after a run in behind from McDaid before Ferrie was tested for the first time three minutes later. The young keeper had struggled with his kicking but was down well to stop a Cammy Blues effort.Ton came into the game more as the half progressed denying Dundee any easy possession but couldn#t create any telling chances.They did, though, go close minutes after the restart following a disputed corner award from the referee. Morton weren#t fussed, however, and it took an Adam header in front of Ferrie to stop Markus Fjortoft equalising.Afolabi was almost in from McDaid#s throughball before Robbie Muirhead smashed over from outside the area.The former United man#s day would end early with  minutes to go as he earned a red card for continued dissent. Seconds after being given a yellow card for mouthing off at the assistant referee, Muirhead#s sarcastic applause earned an early bath.That didn#t stop Ton threatening an equaliser, however, and Fjortoft again went close with a header from a corner before Aiden Nesbitt#s low shot was gathered well by Ferrie in stoppage time.Chances, however, had been at a premium all afternoon for both sides and Afolabi#s fth-minute strike proved to be the dference.Dundee: Ferrie, Kerr, McGhee, Ashcroft, Marshall, Byrne, Dorrans, Adam , McDaid, Mullen , Afolabi.Subs not used: Hamilton, Robertson, Anderson, Blacklock, D Strachan.Morton: McAdams, Ledger, Fjortoft, McLean, McGinty, Jacobs , McAlister, Muirhead, Orsi , Salkeld , Blues.Subs not used: McGuffie, Strapp, Colville, Omar.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Further consideration is also being given to the interaction between Dundee and neighbouring areas within the Tayside Health Board area.”From November , Scotland will be moving to a five-tier structure for lockdown restrictions, with dferent measures in place across the country.No final decisions have been made, and further discussions will take place with local authorities in the coming days.The letter also states: “At this crucial stage in suppressing the virus, with higher case numbers, the winter approaching, and the introduction of a new strategic framework, the public health advice to Ministers is that it would not be safe to move any area straight to the lowest level, Level .”The letter also states that according to the framework, levels, once introduced, are likely to remain in place for two to four weeks but will be reviewed weekly and that levels will only be applied where it is #justied, necessary and proportionate in the face of the threat of the virus running out of control, and only kept in place for so long as that remains the case.#Local authorities and directors of public health across Scotland are expected to discuss their thoughts with the Scottish Government on Tuesday, before final decisions are reached and implemented in the days leading up to November .Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It wasn’t pretty but it doesn’t need to be, we got the three points.“I’m delighted for the players, as a group they needed that. We all needed a pick-me-up from last week and you can talk about performance but sometimes in football you just want the three points and Saturday was one of them.”McPake rang the changes from the defeat at Tynecastle with five new faces coming into the side.That saw an immediate impact as Jonathan Afolabi smashed in after just five minutes on his first start for the club since joining on loan from Celtic.Also impressing after ing to the starting XI were Declan McDaid, Danny Mullen, Shaun Byrne and young goalkeeper Calum Ferrie, making his first league start in three years.The Dens gaffer said: “Afolabi is a handful and technically very good. It was a really good finish, he’s got a great left foot.“Again he’s behind where we’d want him to be, him and Danny Mullen. Afolabi will get us goals but his all-round play was really good and I’m delighted for him.“Calum was great. He’s waited and been very patient to get his chance. I worked with him at U s and he is really reliable. The clean sheet will give him a boost.”He added: “I thought Shaun Byrne was excellent coming back in after being out a while. He’s also missed a lot of pre-season so to come in and play  minutes and control the middle of the pitch, I was delighted with him as well.”The victory gets Dundee off the mark in the Championship this season with another home match against in-form Raith Rovers to come next week.With Hearts making a fast start to the promotion race, McPake was delighted to see his sideto winning ways so quickly.“Maybe last year that would have been a game we lost, particularly after a big defeat,” he added.“It was a tough week for the players and they were hurting, as was everybody.“The important thing was to get the three points. We need to be better and we will be better but Saturday was just get the three points and get out of there.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretlEsHZIFr\" data-secret\"lEsHZIFr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

You saw a team that was organised, wanted to play football and the back five were dferent class from set-plays. We dealt with everything they had.“When we went down to  men, you couldn’t tell which team had  men.“We should have scored, Gary Oliver and Nesbitt when they came on and Markus Fjortoft has a free header and should score.“I thought we looked the better team, we looked fitter, we looked organised and caused Dundee problems.“I’m devastated we got beat because I don’t think we even deserved a draw, I think we deserved three points.“Dundee looked out on their feet at the end andwe had got one I think we’d have gone on to win the game.”Chasing an equaliser, Morton’s cause wasn’t helped by former Dundee United forward Robbie Muirhead picking up two yellow cards within seconds for continued dissent.Hopkin, though, wasn’t happy with the reaction from Dundee players and staff.“It was poor,” he added.“It was a throw-in to us with the linesman two yards away but Robbie shouldn’t react.“You’ve got players and coaching staff from Dundee shouting for a second yellow which I thought was really poor. It’s a situation where I wouldn’t do that to any other club so I don’t see why they did it to our player.“It makes the referee take the decision to send Robbie off.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretQALJbdio\" data-secret\"QALJbdio\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Hewas terric.#I gave him a special mention in the dressing room there because I don#t think we could#ve got the result without him.#That shows how important he is and he needs to feel that importance.#McInnes went on to praise both Wright and fellow sub Sam Cosgrove for the pace and counter-attacking threat they gave the Dons up top late on.Wright#s speed certainly caught out beleaguered Celtic centre-back Shane Duffy, who # facing his own goal near the left corner # was robbed before he could get a long ball up the line under control.With the score at -, the Dons attacker, who#d only been on the park less than  minutes, squared the ball to fit-again striker Sam Cosgrove, whose shot was saved by Scott Bain before partner-in-crime Hedges turned home the rebound.Of course, from - up, Aberdeen then found themselves - down going into stoppage time and fighting desperately to take something from their performance against the champions.Their dramatic late penalty leveller again started with an electric moment of attacking from Wright, who took the ball from the halfway line to the edge of the Celtic area, beating four players in the process, before feeding Hedges. Hedges# cut-back found Connor McLennan, who was wiped out as he sidestepped Callum McGregor to win the spot-kick, which Lewis Ferguson converted.Wright#s two goal-making interventions can be seen at : and : of the clip below, as well as a moment at :, where he nearly played Cosgrove in to put the Reds - ahead:Opta stats reveal, over the course of Wright#s  regular minutes and three injury-time minutes on the pitch, he had  touches of the ball, completing  of  passes he attempted and creating two chances for the Dons.Jonny Hayes was the only other player in the Reds# ranks to create two opportunities against Celtic # and he played the entirety of the Premiership clash.Here#s a map of Wright#s touches once he was sent on:As you can see, Wright was not just getting himself on the ball, but finding possession around the Celtic box or in areas where he was able to run at the opposition defenders down the left-hand side.Over the course the second period, the majority of which Wright played, almost % of Aberdeen#s attacking play went down the left and, as a result, involved him. vw, px\"  His link-up with left-back Jonny Hayes saw Wright complete five passes to the Irishman, while he also linked-up successfully with Lewis Ferguson , as well as Hedges and Cosgrove .Impressively, at a moment where Aberdeen were first chasing the lead and then chasing an equaliser as the clock ticked down, Wright#s passing accuracy of .% was the highest of both teams, as was his passing accuracy in the opposition half .Despite his relatively short time on the field, Wright also won possession for Aberdeen five times, beaten by only Ferguson and Hayes, while he lost it four times # the lowest figure for a Dons player.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome press reports this week on plans for an alternative A route may have been on the optimistic side.

My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Volunteer helpers including Patrick Gibb from Strachur, Martyn and Robin Webster, Terry Muirhead-Smith and Derek Anstee of Inveraray.Early October is expected to see a big event – the -foot hull finally turned right way up, marking the half-way point in its construction.The wooden sections came largely pre-cut and shaped by Jordan Boats of Somerset, ready to be assembled locally around a #hog# template using woodworking tools and an epoxy binder. With the main build phase over, she next requires seats and gunwales, not to mention a paint job and a set of oars.When complete the skf will likely be launched at Strachur. It is to be crewed by a team of four rowers and a coxswain.The boat will be named #Mrs McPhun# after the Strachur woman who thought she was widowed by the hanging of her husband Archie McPhun for murder at Inveraray. As Mrs McPhun, their child and the body were being rowed back to Strachur for burial, Archie’s ‘corpse’ groaned, and he was resuscitated. He lived on for some years, albeit with a crooked neck!In recognition of the expected funeral that happily never happened, the skf will be painted black.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club was set up in Inveraray two years ago with the aim of building and operating a St Ayles skf on the upper reaches of the loch.The club is a member of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association , which encourages boat building, rowing and racing of coastal rowing boats around the Scottish Coastline. Most follow the design of the St Ayles skf, which emerged in Anstruther based on the traditional Fair Isle skf, and the Scottish community rowing regattas that were traditionally popular.The kit-built boat greatly reduces the cost to a community and, as they are a standard design, they can be fairly raced in rowing against one another. It quickly became a remarkable success, attracting worldwide attention and creating its own boating class association, St Ayles Skf International . There are now over  St Ayles skfs operating around Scotland’s coast and abroad, including over a dozen in Argyll and others in the Netherlands, USA and Australia.The SCRA now has over  member clubs around the Scottish Coast and on large freshwater lochs.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club, which aims to promote community spirit, learning and purposeful activity for young and old, is open to new members – to help maintain the boat, and potential rowers and navigators keen to learn nautical skills.For further information about the rowing club please contact Martyn Webster at martyn@martynwebster .For club membership or purchasing a share in the boat please contact Terry Muirhead-Smith at terrymuirheadsmith@hotmail .PICS:. no-a_LochFyneSkfNeil Wilson at work on the keel, watched by Robin Webster. no-a_LochFyneSkf. no-a_LochFyneSkf"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor october 2 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSirThe fiasco that is the A   Rest and be Thankful is an apt metaphor for the ineptitude of the Scottish government and its handling of issues as erse as transport, the economy, education and health matters.R Finlay, ArdrishaigSir,With regard to your interesting article on routes into Argyll proposed by transport Scotland I see no mention of a tunnel. Surely the simplest solution would be a tunnel from Arrochar to Butterbridge, or from Ardgarten to Butterbridge. From Arrochar may be better as the route is more of a straight line.As a former resident of Tarbert now living in Taynuilt I now live less than  miles from a tunnel into and below a hillside at Loch Awe, Ben Cruachan. I refer of course to the tunnel constructed in  with less sophisticated tools than available now.I have also seen an article on the building of tunnels for carrying water from Loch Katrine to Glasgow, much earlier than , again using more primitive equipment. In addition to those tunnels look at the construction of the railways during the railway early years. There are examples of tunnelling all over the world where knowledge could be given to the Scottish government.Cost should not be an issue, as it seems none is being spared at present to no avail.Dugald McDougall, TaynuiltSir,Many years ago I suggested, to an MP, option seven in the list of options being considered in the list released by the Scottish Government.I also pointed out that the bridging of the Loch Fyne narrows at Port Ann could be used to generate hydro power by incorporating hydro tunnels at the base of the crossing and thus provide income to alleviate costs, while the same time reducing travels costs for commercial and private users and consequently help the environment by reducing pollution.I received favourable opinion from a prominent firm of civil engineers and a #like# from a government official. To give that person credit, however, there were very many more pressing problems.I also note that the simplest idea I have since offered – that of a tunnel through the saddle to connect the ends of the existing military roads below and on each side of the Rest and thereafter, upgrading the old military road to A road standard is not even considered.This begs the question why is  Government in such a mountainous region of Scotland so averse to tunnels In the time since I made such suggestions, more than enough money has been drained away in making repairs.Capt Jim Currie, former Tarbert harbour masterScotland has around , older military veterans and Age Scotland believes that many go without the assistance available to them, such as priority healthcare for conditions linked to their service, help with dental and eye care, housing and financial support.We have launched a revamped version of our popular free #Veterans# Guide to Later Le in Scotland#.The guide features information about support and opportunities available to every older person in Scotland, plus content specically for British Armed Forces veterans including regulars, reservists, National Servicemen and merchant navy who have sailed in support of a British military operation.It is most relevant to veterans aged  plus, but much of the content will be of interest to veterans aged -, regardless of how long ago, or for how long they served.If you are aged  or older, live in Scotland and have served in the armed forces, the guide will be most relevant to you. It doesn’t matter how long ago, or for how long, you served: you may have had a military career, a short period of national service, been a reservist, or even supported a military operation with the merchant navy.Many people we’ve met through our Veterans’ Project left the armed forces with little or no support for readjusting to civilian le. Today, the military is more proactive in supporting that transition, but older veterans it seems were, by and large, left to it.Our guide aims to ensure veterans have a better experience when making the transition to later le.Veterans and their families can request a free paper guide by calling Age Scotland on     or visiting www.age.scot veteransguide.

That ambition must be tempered with a degree of realism – Argyll and Bute needs a solution to be delivered as soon as possible and the delivery timeline is a key issue in considering all the options.#That is why the council supports option one as offering realistic solutions which will increase resilience on the A and provide the uninterrupted year-round access that Argyll and Bute needs and deserves.#This route corridor appears, on the face of it, to offer the most deliverable set of solutions within an option, although these remain engineering projects of considerable signicance and which will be complex to progress.#Six of the other  options will not be supported by the council, while options two to five are not ruled outthey can be delivered sustainably.Of those, the council rates option five as its preference. The route would make use of existing roads while new crossings would be built over Loch Long between Whistlefield and Barnacabber, and Loch Fyne between Otter Ferry and Port Ann.Option two goes through Glen Kinglas, option three through Glen Fyne, and option four starts the same as option five from Arden, but moves north from Barnacabber to Cairndow.On those four options, the council said: #These ambitious proposals have signicant transformative potential for Argyll and Bute, increasing resilience as well as enhancing connectivity to, from and for all of Argyll and Bute, including opening up more direct connections to the central belt for communities like Mid Argyll and Kintyre.#If any of these options can be delivered or substantially progressed within an acceptable timeframe, then the council will support them.##The opportunities arising from more direct access to and from the central belt could be truly transformational. The scale and ambition of these corridor options would suggest that they are longer term options.#Councillor Rory Colville said: #Whilst some of the options put forward are to be welcomed, option one is the only one that can be delivered in a realistic timescale. I also believe that option five needs further deliberation as a longer term solution to unlock the historical link our area previously enjoyed with the central belt.#Argyll First Councillor Donald Kelly added: #This has a long way to go and, like everyone, I just want to see a permanent solution delivered. The front runner appears to be option one and,this proves to be feasible and affordable, we will need to maintain pressure on the Scottish Government to make sure it delivers as promised. I am sorry to sound sceptical but only when I see the first turf being cut will I finally believe that a new road will become a reality.#"},{"url":null,"title":"districts october 23 2020","story":"The Scottish Wildle Trust and Royal Zoological Society of Scotland is hosting an online event on Wednesday October  on the Scottish Beavers Reinforcement Project.People will be able to hear about the latest fieldwork, which took place in September, as well as the strategic successes of the three-year project. There will be talks about the impact of beavers on local wildle tourism, the future of Knapdale Forest and an update on the national approach to beavers.The project began in , aiming to bolster the population of beavers released during the Scottish Beaver Trial.Twenty-one beavers were introduced from Tayside to increase numbers and genetic ersity in the Knapdale beaver population. All animals were screened by qualied vets prior to release to ensure they were healthy and disease-free.Annual surveys show many animals released through the project have successfully established territories and bred. It is hoped the new kits will eventually form breeding pairs with beavers descended from the Norwegian beavers released during the Scottish Beaver Trial increasing the overall ersity of Argyll’s beaver population and giving it the best chance for future success.The project is led by Scottish Beavers, a partnership between the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and the Scottish Wildle Trust, created to continue the work of the Scottish Beaver Trial. It is taking place on land managed by Forest and Land Scotland and has been licensed by NatureScot, which is also co-ordinating monitoring requirements at the site.To register for the event, hosted on Zoom from .pm on Wednesday October , visit scottishwildletrust.org.uk or email enquiries@scottishwildletrust.org.ukISLANDS:Scotland’s islands could lead a revolution in the way people shop with financial support being provided to eradicate wasteful packaging.Zero Waste Scotland will administer £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower shops, from Shetland to Arran and all the islands in between, to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.Single-use grocery packaging, from tubs and trays to bottles and bags, account for around  per cent of all household waste across the country.Finance from the Islands Green Recovery Plan – Refillery Fund will be provided for dispensing and other equipment that enables customers to obtain grocery products in reusable containers brought from home.This includes dispensers for dry goods such as cereals, pulses, grains, herbs, spices, pasta and rice, liquid items such as milk, fruit juices, oils and vinegars, and other products such as laundry detergents, washing up liquids, fabric softeners and liquid soaps.Some pioneering shops have already started using package-free dispensers but the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: #Island communities have to bear the double burden of dealing with imported single-use items and then the shipping-off of waste.#This scheme gives shops on the islands the chance to be ahead of the game and at the forefront of a positive change. The financial help we are making available will enable outlets to make this signicant positive step.#There is an understanding among communities about the damage done by single-use packaging as they see the effects in the countryside, beaches and seas around them.#As well as reducing waste, by opting for reuse we also reduce our carbon footprint by eliminating the need to extract, transport and manufacture materials to make new products.#The scheme is part of a larger £ million programme designed to inspire locally-led green projects as part of the recovery from the Covid- pandemic.Across Scotland, around kg of packaging per household generates an estimated , tonnes of global production emissions per year. Single-use grocery packaging also creates litter.Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: #The Islands Green Recovery Programme will stimulate new economic activity across our islands – helping to create a sustainable green economy.#We are aware that mitigating the effects of climate change can be more expensive for those living on our islands, which is why we are delighted to announce this funding.#This investment with Zero Waste Scotland is available to small and medium enterprises – who wish to offer customers a packaging-free shopping experience, where they are encouraged to use their own re-useable containers to purchase a range of foods and household groceries.#Applications for funding are open until pm on November  .

Our family used a product called ‘pipe clay’ to keep our steps gleaming white.However, they didn’t always stay in that pristine condition! Early one morning, at about .am, a small herd of cattle was being driven down Longrow en route to the steamer when one cow decided to make a dash for freedom and ended up climbing our stairs!Eventually, one of the herders manoeuvred the very scared beast to ground level and peace was restored, but that left many hours of scrubbing and cleaning to be done. Never to be forgotten!At the Grammar School, romance must have been in the air because four of our male teachers chose local shop assistants to woo. These charming ladies would each become their respective wives, but we enjoyed the gossip as their stories developed.Campbeltown had no fire engines until after the Second World War, but they used what was jokingly called ‘The Ice Cream Barrow’ which was a two-wheeled barrow loaded with fire-fighting equipment and pushed by untrained council workers.

I knew one of them, Roddy MacLeod, from Glebe Street, but, unfortunately, I cannot recall the name of the second one.A huge crowd had gathered in the Main Street to give them a warm welcome home. I had never before seen so many people assembled in one place, and as a MacBrayne’s bus, carrying the men, slowly made its way to the Post Office, the cheering began and resonated throughout the whole town.People were laughing and crying with the sheer unrestrained emotion of the day.

He said after the meeting with Mr Noble: #He’s with us. We had a long talk with him on the trawling problem. He said that he would do all he could. He couldn#t commit himself but he gave us a fighting chance.#The fear for the safety of the Clyde herring stocks is a recurring anxiety of the Clyde fishermen.

The original £, awarded for improvements related to town centres was topped up by a further £, funding. There was also an additional £, to improve walking and wheeling access to schools.After fully analysing responses from the consultation, local area committees have agreed to go ahead with a number of projects across the authority area.According to the council, the consultation identied that Campbeltown#s town centre already has sufficient space for physical distancing and maintaining all existing car parking spaces was seen as a priority.Instead, work will focus on providing a cycleway and improved pavements on the section of Ralston Road between Campbeltown Hospital and Campbeltown Grammar School which is bounded by playing fields and therefore will not require any space to be taken from the existing road.The council is also looking at the Esplanade to confirma segregated cycleway can be accommodated without losing any existing on-street parking.Councillor Colville said: #I believe the analysis and participation in the consultation was excellent, the results from which, when linked to the new Traffic Regulation Order now in operation, will greatly improve access to town centre shopping.#I would also thank officers in gaining funding to improve social distancing on the narrow pavements leading to the Grammar school, something both myself and Councillor Armour were keen to achieve.#Councillor Armour added: #The result of the consultation is exactly what I was hearing from local businesses and the public, that there was enough space in the middle of the town to social distance.#I think the idea of a cycleway and improved pavements between the hospital entrance and the school bus turning area is an excellent idea and something Councillor Colville and myself pushed hard for during the consultation.#The pavement in that area is far too narrow when pupils are coming and going from school so opening up the area and including a safe cycleway should allow a safe distance for those walking on the pavement and a new option with the cycleway.#However, Councillor Kelly said: #Every grant and tranche of funding must be used to gain maximum benefit for the community.

Its constables included several Lauders of the Bass. Their writ ran south of the Tweed to include Ancroft, Kyloe, Norham, Belford, Elwick and Tweedmouth, as well as present-day Berwickshire.At a time when the sea was the highway for commerce in heavy goods, South Berwickbecame the richest city in the land, thriving on trade with the Low Counties and Hanseatic Ports in timber, wool and produce from the Merse.English kings coveted its strategic location. While the English were embroiled where, Berwick blossomed. At other times, Berwick changed hands  times until, in , it fell to Richard III. Elizabeth I secured it with massive fortications, which survive intact.With the Union, most of its hinterland stayed in Scotland. For five centuries, this made scant dference beyond legal issues. However, re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament created disparities ndash in free personal care, prescriptions, tuition fees, etc.Resentment at this in Berwick itself was compounded when Berwick District Council was abolished and the town became a remote appendage to Northumberland.The northward bulge of the border between the Cheviots and the sea remains a defensive throwback. This modern anomaly of Berwick and the disparity between its residents and those in its hinterland could be resolved by a plebiscite among the , residents to decidethe border should be shted south from Lamberton Toll to around Lindisfarne, ing the town and southern villages to Berwickshire.Satisfactory as this might be to locals, Westminster is likely to block such a move.

The important role of plants in reducing pollution is now so widely recognised that many nations are actively promoting large-scale planting of trees.Whilst most of us would be upset to think that there might be poor air quality in our homes, the reality is that common airborne pollutants such as CO, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds and phthalates from new materials and furnishings are quite normal, and that is exacerbated where the building, furnishings and decoration are new.Working from home offers an opportunity to optimise the air quality in which we work and live, ensuring best conditions. Although therersquos no substitute for opening the window and circulating the air, we live in Scotland and sometimes thatrsquos simply not possible! Cue houseplants to help improve the air quality, reduce noise pollution and generally create a more relaxed, natural environment.Our top  indoor plants:. Chlorophytum Possibly our best-selling indoor plant, this green and white iegated plant is very simple to care for.With research showing that the spider plant is capable of removing up to  per cent of household air-borne toxins in just two days, itrsquos easy to see why itrsquos a customer favourite.The graceful arching habit of the spider plant makes it suitable as either a hanging plant or in a pot on the desk.One interesting feature of the spider plant is that it produces little lsquoplantletsrsquo on stems which can be easily rooted to create a new plant.. Spathiphyllum The peace lily is also a very easy plant to care for, and very attractive with glossy green leaves and pure white flowers. It is an excellent air purier and is particularly good at removing mould spores and household vapours such as benzene, ammonia and acetone.Depending on the iety, the peace lily can range in height from around cm to over one metre.The peace lily is happy in medium to low light levels, making it ideal for the home office. Attractive purely as a foliage plant, yoursquoll encourage more flowering with better light.The peace lily is unlikely to need watering every day and itrsquos best to take your cue from the plant itself. If the leaves begin to droop, itrsquos usually a sign that it needs some water, but be careful and check that itrsquos not because you have over-watered ndash being too generous with water is one of the most common reasons for these plants to fail!. Ficus benjamina Many plants ndash both indoors and outdoors ndash can be useful in reducing noise pollution. So,your home office is in the corner of a room thatrsquos used by other family members, plants with lots of foliage can be a useful way to create an aesthetic room ider and separate noise.There are many weeping fig ieties available, offering a choice of dferent shades of green or iegated silver green or gold green foliage.Weeping figs thrive in areas where there is good light andlight is only available from one direction, growth will be primarily on the light-facing side. Thatrsquos finethe plant is only seen from one side, for exampleitrsquos against a wall, but for all-round foliage, yoursquoll need to rotate the plant occasionally.As with most houseplants, water when the compost is dry to the touch and take care not to over-water.. Monstera One of the most easily recognised indoor plants with an upright habit and large glossy leaves with cuts and holes , itrsquos native to the South American rainforests and it is understood that the leaves have naturally developed these holes and cuts to help the plantrsquos large leaves avoid damage in tropical storms.In the home, it is often grown on a moss pole to provide an anchor for the aerial rootswhich fix into the pole for stability as the plant grows taller.This plant doesnrsquot need a great deal of attention water when the compost becomes dry, and place it in a bright room but preferably not in direct sunlight, and mist the leavesthe humidity seems low.. Sansevieria All Sansevieria are incredibly tough and, for those who believe that they canrsquot keep plants, this is definitely the plant that should change their thinking!There are many dferent ieties of Sansevieria, with dferent common names including the mother-in-lawrsquos tongue because of its sharpness, or the snake plant because of its mottled foliage.These striking plants have upright, rigid leaves which can be flat or cylindrical, green, iegated or even striped depending on iety. With their simple, bold, architectural structure, they are almost sculptural in appearance and requiring minimal attention, theyrsquore tolerant of even the least green-fingered.Of course, these are only a few of the many dferent indoor plants we have in the garden centre where our staff are always happy to give you help and advice on the best plants for your home office.

Not Calum Franklin.\"My we works for the NHS so I think I had just a mixture of guilt and boredom after a week - I needed to do something,\" Franklin tells me on the phone, just days before hes due to reopen the highly-acclaimed restaurant and The Pie Room - which sells pastry-based creations to-go - both located at the five-star Rosewood Hotel.\"Theres a local butcher near me in Greenwich and I get on well with the owner - I went in with a plan. What we did was we organised a local business group in the Greenwich area,\" he explains.\"Whether it was a cheesemonger, a baker, a brewery, they all provided ingredients free of charge, then we made pies here in the hotel and sold them at the butchers.\"And then all the money we raised over the lockdown period went towards building a garden for staff at Greenwich and Lewisham NHS hospitals, and we also raised money for a local hospice that really suffered during that period because of fundraising.\"Before embarking on the pie-making project, Franklin had started, like many chefs, preparing meals for hospital workers.\"I got word from a few hospitals that they were actually inundated with food, so I thought, I want to do something more permanent,\" he adds. \"At the end of this, its like a reminder, this is a thanks [to the staff] for your hard work.\"As well as his philanthropic efforts, with many eateries closed, the British chef was making more meals at home than usual this year too. So has he suffered, as many people have reported, any cooking fatigue \"For me it was washing-up fatigue. Ive never done so much washing-up in my le,\" Franklin says with a chuckle, though he admits there was one benefit to not being able to eat out as much as usual.\"What it made me realise is, actually, that my diet was pretty poor before, because Id go out a lot and eat in London a lot of the time. Looking at it now, my we and I are maybe eating meat once a week, or fish twice a week, the rest of the time its vegetarian food.\"The -year-old has also been busy preparing for the launch of his debut cookbook. Called The Pie Room, it features dishes that have appeared on the Holborn Dining Room menu alongside some new recipes, as well as detailed guides on how to perfect all the classic pastry types, from shortcrust to choux.Franklin hopes itll help dispel some of the fear that surrounds pastry-making. Why does he think people are often scared when it comes to the baking staple \"One of the biggest issues people have, I think, is not controlling temperatures. Its that thing of when you try to make a pie on a summers day and its super hot in the kitchen and the pastrys melting, the butters splitting out of it, its hard to make it look pretty...\"That in itself is enough to put someone off doing pastry again, I think - that or getting a Wellington wrong and youve got the whole family sat around the table and you cut it and it doesnt look nice, the beefs overcooked... Its a lot of work for it to go wrong.\"Naturally, the self-confessed pastry deviant thinks homemade is best, but even he will bust out a packet of the shop-bought stuff on occasion.\"Theres no shame in it. Ill use Jus-Rol at homeIm in a rush to do something, I have that in the freezer,\" he says, which is why recipes in the book include the option of readymade in the ingredients list.\"One thing that always plays on my mind throughout the whole process is that everyones lives are so busy nowadays. I think you will get a better result by doing your own handmade pastryyou follow those recipes in the book, but its not going to be for every night.\"So whats a good a recipe for a beginner to start with  Its not, you may be surprised to discover, a time-honoured British classic, but a thoroughly modern pie with a American-inspired filling.\"Something like the mac and cheese pie is a good one because the fillings really quick and easy, and then you can apply some of the decoration techniques that are in the book,\" Franklin says. \"And its SO tasty. Its super naughty - Ive never served that and it hasnt made people smile.\"Soon, the chef will be making diners smile on a daily basis again, and he couldnt be happier at the prospect of getting back to the hustle and bustle of the kitchen - no matter how hectic it gets.\"Its exciting to be cooking again.

Strange Timez combines a myriad of genres, sounds and styles with a formidable selection of guest artists, producing an album that has something for everyone.We get pulsing, reverb-heavy beats on Pac-Man , punchy, frantic rock drumming on Momentary Blissand even a melancholic power ballad in The Pink Phantom .The distinctive croon of mastermind Damon Albarn comes through sporadically but only to complement the scores of big-hitting guest artists - from Robert Smith to Skepta - who each bring a dferent vibe and personality to their track.Unlike previous albums Demon Days and Plastic Beach there is no single theme or sound to Song Machine, which might not be to everyones taste but is sure to appeal to those who like a bit of everything.Review by Michael BediganRUSSELL WATSON -

By November, that mood seems to pass as body and mind recalibrate, finding a new rhythm that allows me to embrace the longer nights. But right now, it feels like being hit by a juggernaut.The prospect of winter seems almost suffocating after the bright summer months and vibrant, kaleidoscopic colours of autumn. Usually around this time of year I begin to rely on a series of rituals to help bolster my depleted energy levels.I mentally prepare to hunker down: lighting candles, getting cosy with blankets and thick socks, curling up with a good book, watching old movies, filling a favourite mug to the brim with hot chocolate and tiny marshmallows.It is about being kind to myself. The thing is, though, that is a mantra Ive been following for months now. It has become well-worn.

The Labour Government at the end of the Second World War could have decided not to have nuclear weapons. It initially took the option to have them largely because of status and pride. Ernest Bevin, then the Foreign Secretary, stated: \"Wersquove got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.\" The costs of maintaining that status have become more and more expensive over the years, which has led to the UK becoming more and more reliant upon the US for technical support at a cost. The theory must be that it is better to have a nuclear deterrent sort of independent rather than not have such deterrent at all.I also believe that status still has a large part to play in the UKrsquos position today, albeit we are far removed from the circumstances prevailing at the end of the Second World War. It is interesting that all five permanent members of the UN Security Council are nuclear powers: China, France, Russia, the UK and the US. The UK, no doubt, places great value upon that status and is likely to regard being a nuclear power as helping to sustain it. The original idea was that the five would progressively disarm in exchange for other states not acquiring nuclear weapon facilities. That idea has gone well, hasnrsquot it  Look at India and Pakistan and the likelihood of some others.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.SEAPLANES AT LARGEI WAS surprised that no mention was made, in the article about the stranded seaplane in Loch Ness , of the  Catalina seaplanes based in Largs during the Second World War.

On the face of it this sounds quite reasonable, but as I see it there is one fundamental flaw.The idea which is being advanced by scientists is that the four nations would sit down together and come up with a plan which would be arrived at after due consultation and negotiation. It is here that the idea collapses. The four nations are not at the table on an equal basis. One of those nations, England as represented by the Tory Government, holds both the numerical advantage and the purse strings. It already has form particularly in the north of the country, of advancing the notion of negotiation when in fact what it is doing is to use the screen of democracy as a means of imposing its will. We must always remember that the chief advisor to Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet, Dominic Cumming, cares not a jot about democracy, only about achieving his aims.In a four-nation approach therefore there would be a plan put forward which in essence would be telling three of the nations what the fourth and biggest has decided. This would mean in Scotland that the First Minister would no longer carry the responsibility and accountability for addressing the fight against the pandemic.I appreciate, particularly in the hospitality industry there are problems in Scotland. But are we saying that we would really want Mr Johnson to set the agenda. You only have to look at the polls in England on his handling of the virus to realise that any misgivings we may have in Scotland are magnied -fold down south.If I thought for a moment that a four-nation approach was what the name suggests was possible I might consider it. However, in reality what a four-nation approach would be is one nation setting the rules for the other three.George Kay, Burntisland.YOUR front page lead article on Fridaycontains a paragraph, that,correct, means the First Minister should forthwith resign as it clear that she has become unfit to hold office.Legal challenges do not undermine public health: they serve to test whether decisions by her and her Government or by local authorities made under legislation are lawful. To exclude or discourage recourse to the courts is to undermine the rule of law. The rule of law is fundamental to democracy.To state that legal challenges ldquomakes future flexibilities less likely to be granted is the threat of a dictator and many have come to the view that the actions of her Government since  demonstrate that it is, in effect, totalitarian. She has forgotten that the devolved Scottish Parliament was meant to operate by consensus. She should now go without delay.James Mitchell, Glasgow G.THE village I live in used to have a pub, a hotel, a British Legion club. Like many other villages we have lost our amenities through industrial declineand changes in social habits. Governments all over Europe have closed down the licensed hospitality industry as the dangers of enclosed spaces combined with an alcohol-induced loss of inhibition, lead to increased risk of catching spreading a deadly virus.The hospitality industry is to take the Scottish Government to court to attempt to re-open their facilities in one way or another . While I have great sympathy for their plight, I cannot help but wonder:they win their case, do they then become liable in law for any subsequent health issue their customers suffer, after opening against the specic advice of health authorities GR Weir, Ochiltree.GIVEN that the second outbreak of Covid- was entirely predictable as soon as schools and universities went back after the summer, I make another prediction.Christmas could bring a huge spike in cases, particularly with students ing to their homes.

Outside the kitchen window the back green looks asa thousand boxes of large cornflakes have been spilled across it cars that are parked nearby overnight drive off in the morning with a mosaic of leaves stuck to their windscreens.Beneath the spreading horse chestnut, the split shells of conkers lie like our answer to coconuts, white, gleaming and empty.

Yet even as I write, leaves flutter downward, dislodged by blackbirds or by the pull of October gravity. By the time yoursquore reading this, some trees will be almost bare. In the back garden, the whitebeam is shaking its head, scattering oval ribbed leaves over the grass. Whenever I sweep up, therersquos plenty more where they came from. Itrsquos a task I enjoy, a sort of horticultural hoovering although, unlike some, we donrsquot have a leaf blower. I prefer the swish of the rake and gathering armfuls, along with windfall apples nibbled by birds and mice.Irsquove always loved late autumn, but its arrival is less welcome than usual. Most poetry, as in Keatsrsquo famous ode, glories in the abundance of colour and atmosphere, although WH Auden is as miserablist as they come in Autumn Song. More appropriate this year, to my mind, is Louis MacNeicersquos Autumn Journal, which I spent a rainy afternoon reading. Previously Irsquod only known a few lines, often read aloud by my husband, who knows parts of it by heart: ldquoAnd August going out to the tin trumpets of nasturtiums And the sunflowersrsquo Salvation Army blare of brass. The whole work is an immersion in desperate times in Europe, as observed by a man too young to offer much hope.Autumn Journal was written as the summer of  turned to winter, during which the Munich Agreement was settled, and the Spanish Civil War began stuttering to its end. MacNeice was in London and his evocations of the city and his own affairs over the months to New Year are vivid and sombre. For all its picaresque observations, this is a profound, plangent and foreboding piece of work. While he wrote, he could not have known that one year later the country, and much of the world, would be at war. Nevertheless, intimations of menace underlie its mood. Many of its lines could have been written for our present predicament, not just Covid but also Brexit: ldquoConferences, adjournments, ultimatums, Flights in the air, castles in the air The autopsy of treaties, dynamite under the bridges, The end of laissez faire.In MacNeicersquos epic poem, as today, autumn reaches into the heart of every city but in the countryside it is all-pervasive, and offers a misleading sense of normality. Tractors rattle past, their trailers heaped with potatoes so pungent you can smell them from a distance. On the main road out of the village earlier in the week an escaped bull, a Belted Galloway, created a logjam. Grazing by the roadside, he could not be budged. It was two hours before he could be coaxed back into his field and traffic could get by once again. I see he had been put into solitary confinement, well away from the heers and calves.Meanwhile, gardens are being put to bed or, in our case, allowed to stay up a little too late, as we catch up on a backlog of muddy duties, among them planting bulbs. This involves the almost industrial-scale removal of stones as, inch by inch, we reclaim the garden from its subcutaneous layer of rubble. As I was in the process of doing this, half the village seemed to pass and pause for a chat. It was a heart-warming glimmer of the old days, when people would often meet up for coffee, or gin, and jamboree in the village hall. With falling temperatures and heavy rain, all of that has fallen into abeyance and the lack is sorely felt.With Hallowersquoen approaching, carved pumpkins are beginning to appear on windowsills. They are the embodiment of autumn, night-time suns that banish the gloom and merrily brighten the darkening evenings. As I was thinking of carving one of my own for the doorstep, I found YouTube filled with the most gruesome examples, which turn fun into horror as big pumpkins crunch screaming baby pumpkins, or have their heads split open, allowing their seedy ldquobrains to spill out. I know this is the season of ghouls, but Irsquoll be putting a smiley face on mine.Listening to the news, itrsquos hard to believe that the crisis looming over us will one day be history. MacNeice was living in far graver times than ours and, while the present predicament is deeply worrying, his era puts ours in perspective. ldquoSleep to the noise of running water Tomorrow to be crossed, however deep  This is no river of the dead or Lethe,  To-night we sleep On the banks of Rubicon ndash the die is cast There will be time to audit The accounts later, there will be sunlight later And the equation will come out at last.He was, of course, right. Just as Derek Mahon, who died at the start of this month, was right when he wrote his popular poem, Everything Is Going To Be All Right. This injunction to optimism, written  years ago when he was very ill, was often quoted as the pandemic took hold: ldquoThere will be dying, there will be dying,  but there is no need to go into that.Like MacNeice, Mahon calls on the sun for solace. ldquoThe sun rises in spite of everything, he writes.

Santa, like Amazon and the mail, must get through.Profs Bauld and Leitch, and their counterparts in other countries, can only imagine the heights of fame attained by one of the guests on The Andrew Marr Show. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US and part of the White House coronavirus taskforce, is as close to a rock star among experts as it is possible to become.In fact, make that a movie star. Brad Pitt, no less, earned an Emmy nomination for playing the Brooklyn-born and accented doctor on Saturday Night Live .With just ten days to go till the US presidential election, it was a minor coup for Marr to land the interview. It was particularly fortuitous given the Government minister for the Sunday shows was Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, whose reputation for being a safe pair of hands ndashmedia translation: dull ndash only grows with time.Mr Lewis did, however, stand by the UK Governmentrsquos refusal to provide free meals during the holidays to the poorest children in England, a controversial move that is sure to keep the subject on the boil until another Labour-led vote in the Commons today.So to Dr Fauci. Marr began by asking why the US and the UK had been hit so badly by coronavirus. In America, said Dr Fauci, there had been inconsistency among the states in abiding by the guidelines, either during lockdown or when it was eased.Dr Fauci added he was ldquosorry to see that in the UK ldquoafter getting hit pretty badly the way we did, you went down to a pretty low level, but now yoursquore starting to escalate in the same manner that we are here.During the final televised debate last Thursday, President Trump said there would be a vaccine by the end of the year. True ldquoWe will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December, said Dr Fauci.ldquoBut the question is, once you have a safe and effective vaccine, or more than one, how can you get it to the people who need it as quickly as possible ldquoThe amount of doses that will be available in December will not certainly be enough to vaccinate everybody, yoursquoll have to wait several months into .He said healthcare workers will likely be prioritised first for any vaccine, as well as people considered at increased risk of complications.Vaccinating a substantial proportion of the population, enough to make an impact, might not be possible until the second or third quarter of .A vaccine alone would notthe country to some form of normality, and would have to be combined with public health measures, he added.Much depended on how many people take the vaccine. It was very important that politicians set an example and backed the science, he said.ldquoPeople look at what their leaders say and do, and you can positively or negatively influence behaviour.ldquoIt would really be a shamewe have a safe and effective vaccine, but a substantial proportion of the people do not want to take the vaccine because they donrsquot trust authority.Most recently, President Trump called the good doctor an ldquoidiot and a ldquodisaster. How did that make you feel, asked Marr.Dr Fauci has served every president from Ronald Reagan onwards without ever attracting such criticism. To generations of Americans he is as familiar and friendly a face as their own doctor.Unsurprisingly, Mr Trumprsquos jibes did not faze the physician. ldquoI focus on what I feel is the most important mission - to preserve the health, the safety and the welfare of the American people directly, and indirectly for the entire world including the UK, by some of the things we do here.Those other things were just ldquodistractions he said. ldquoI donrsquot take that personally, I just do my job."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-brits-embrace-friluftsliv","story":"Itrsquos a bit chilly out there The temperature is dropping, but the pandemic is still in full spate.

Therersquos been an understandable furore over the Tory MPs who questioned the idea of funding free school meals over the holidays in England, but it seems to me that, among supporters of the coronavirus restrictions, therersquos been a distinct lack of furore over the effects that the rules are having on the low-paid. In fact, most of us seem to be willingly participating in the effects, promoting them, and enforcing them.The experiences of some of the people Irsquove encountered in the last few days should help explain what I mean. People like Sarah, whorsquos  years old and has two jobs: cleaning in a caravan site and working in a bar two nights a week. Or Sarahrsquos mother, who also works as a cleaner. I spoke to Sarah towards the end of one of her shts in the bar and she was knackered and stressed, not least because shersquod had to do the whole sht while wearing a mask.But it gets worse. The second job Sarah does cleaning caravans has become much more onerous and time-consuming in recent weeks because the cleaning has to be more thorough because of the virus, so jobs that were taking  minutes are now taking half an hour and so on. The problem is that Sarah is earning the same money but the job has become much harder. The experience of Sarahrsquos mother is similar: her work is much harder than it was and at the end of her sht shersquos tired and frustrated because of the PPE shersquos required to wear.Sarahrsquos attitude to all of this is pretty clear. Her le, and that of her motherrsquos, have become much more dficult and stressful in the last few months and shersquos worried about her income and her future. Shersquos been told her cleaning job at the caravan site is unlikely to continue beyond January and she has to wear a mask for most of her working day. But Sarah is . Her mother is in her s. Their risk of death from the virus is small and hundreds of times lower than it would bethey were in their s or s. In fact, Sarah suspects shersquos already had the virus and recovered.The consequences of not changing to such a policy are pretty grim. Sarah will probably lose her job in a few weeks, and we know there will be lots of others like her because women on low incomes are disproportionately represented in sectors that have been locked down, such as hospitality. Theyrsquore also less likely to be able to work from home so have to go out to work in low-paid jobs made more miserable by restrictions that over-emphasise the risks.So what would you say to Sarah  ldquoItrsquos a price worth paying  ldquoIt would be wrong to relax the restrictions now  The problem with phrases like that is they often come from people with the least to lose. In fact, I seem to have noticed that a personrsquos support for lockdown is often in inverse proportion to the effect itrsquos likely to have on them ndash in other words, itrsquos all very well being keen on restrictions and shutting bars and caravan parks and all the rest of it when you donrsquot have to work in them, and can work from home instead. The point is you canrsquot do Zoomyou work in a bar or clean caravans for a living.Perhaps the solution to the problem ndash a problem which disproportionately affects women ndash could be found in the wisdom of another woman. You may have seen her on TV. Maureen from Barnsley. Shersquos the octogenarian who said she didnrsquot give a sod about the new restrictions in her town and wouldnrsquot be fastened to her house, and her frustration, and her appeal to common sense, seemed to strike a chord with many of those who heard her.Maureenrsquos views on further lockdown could also offer a solution to the plight of people like Sarah. How many lockdowns can we afford, asks Maureen. The people who are going to suffer the most, she says, are our young ones, and the unemployed and what we need to do is focus the help on the elderly people and we canrsquot afford to mess about either. Itrsquos maybe not how an epidemiologist would put it, or a politician, but I like the directness of what Maureen from Barnsley says.

We found bilingual pupils are better in complex language in English and also have better concentration, as reported in other studies on bilingualism.ldquoWe clearly proved the positive effects of bilingualism are not contingent upon learning a global, widely spoken language, like French or Spanish, but are also true when it comes to a small heritage language like Gaelic.Ms Garraffa, along with colleagues from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, looked in detail at the English language skills of high school pupils from a single monolingual secondary and a cohort of young people who had spent their school lives in GME.Ms Garraffa stressed that people who come from non-Gaelic speaking homes got the most visible positive effect, even when they lived in a predominantly English-speaking community.However, the paper, which was published in Frontiers In Psychology, has sparked concerns over whether parents seeking educational advantages for their children will take places designed to support Scotlandrsquos Gaelic-speaking minority.The study took the socio-economic background of the children it looked at into account. Some critics have linked the success of GME education to the fact it is popular among better-off and better-educated families.Ms Garraffa said: ldquoThese results support the rise of a new generation of speakers who care about being bilingual, not for the heritage value but for the recognised benefits of a bilingual education, and are vital for the next steps of the revitalisation policies aimed at saving Gaelic.Gaelic language campaigners can have mixed feelings about the rise of speakers who care about the benefits of bilingualism, not heritage and culture.Wilson McLeod, a professor of Gaelic at Edinburgh University, responded to the Garraffa study by saying this trend was ldquopositive but not unproblematic.The academic has just published a new book, Gaelic In Scotland: Policies, Movements, Ideologies, in which he discusses the trend of Gaelic champions to promote the general benefits of bilingualism.He wrote: ldquoThere is a possibility that some parents may chose Gaelic education for its perceived intellectual and educational benefits but have relatively little engagement with the language and the language community.ldquoThe constant policy pressure to expand Gaelic education and increase the number of children enrolled may mean tending to court the marginally committed.ldquoThat may be a price that has to be paid an approach that focused exclusively on families with a strong, demonstrated commitment to Gaelic would almost certainly not have generated sufficient demand to make provision politically viable, most obviously in places like Edinburgh.GME has been expanding rapidly in Glasgow, where there are three primaries and a secondary and where there is a historically strong Gaelic-speaking community.

I set out at the end of this letter howwe propose to manage that process.We anticipate that the Deputy First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Communities Local Government will then discuss Scotlands Strategic Framework and its implementation with council leaders in calls on Tuesday  and Wednesday  October, in parallel withParliamentary debate and other discussions, before decisions are reached and implementedin the days leading to Monday  November.This is, I know, a challenging timescale in challenging times. I am grateful for the help thatyou and colleagues in COSLA and SOLACE have already given us, and will give in comingdays, as we work through it together.Scotlands Strategic FrameworkCOVID- threatens le, health, society and prosperity in Scotland. The Scottish Government is committed to suppressing the virus to the lowest possible level, and keepingit there while we strive toto a more normal le for as many people as possible. Aftersuccess in doing so over the summer, we are now experiencing high numbers of cases, anda rising challenge.Scotlands Strategic Framework, published on Friday  October, sets out a levels-based system of measures to suppress the virus, based on the \"four harms\" approach set out inour COVID- Framework for Decision-Making.The five levels are set out in the Framework. Each higher level is designed to haveprogressively stronger effects in suppressing the virus and the illness and deaths it causes, by breaking chains of transmission.Measures to suppress the virus themselves cause harm to wider health and care ,societyand the economy . Though we have designed the levels to mitigatethem as much as possible, consistent with suppressing the virus, these wider harms andeconomic impacts are stark, especially at the higher levels. We are profoundly aware of theirimpacts on people, businesses and communities across Scotland. We know, however, thatfailing to suppress the virus, while it remains a threat to public health, would do even greaterdamage, and result in the loss of many more lives.The levels complement other measures, such as promoting compliance with the FACTS guidance and use of the Protect Scotland app, Test  Protect, and self-isolation by those with symptoms and or a positive test.As with the restrictions now in place, the new levels will only be applied where that is justied, necessary and proportionate in the face of the threat of the virus running out of control, and only kept in place for so long as that remains the case. Ministers wish to work in partnership with Local Government and others to mitigate all four harms, and to monitor and respond to impacts on people, society and economic activity. I say more about this later.The effects of exponential growthThe modelling and advice available to Ministers shows that measures to suppress the virusare more effective when they are applied as soon as they are needed. This is challenging,since it means decision must be taken quickly, and often in circumstances that are volatile,uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Decisive action, however, can mean that measures canbe in place for a shorter period with a greater effect than would otherwise be necessary.Where delay lets the virus get a hold, the measures needed to get it back under control have to be more severe and in place for longer.This is because, when cases start to rise, indicated by a reproduction number or R above ,they do so exponentially, and we have seen how the numbers of new infections can doublein little more than a week. The most serious effects, including admissions to hospital andintensive care, and deaths, lag behind new infections by between two and three weeks. Thismeans it is necessary to take measures early, in order to save lives and prevent the NHSbeing overwhelmed.The approach set out in Scotlands Strategic Framework is designed to help get the right level of measures in place as quickly as possible, for the shortest necessary time, to bringthe virus under control in each part of Scotland. Success means bringing R below , andseeing case numbers drop.Intervening early is also the best way to reduce the long-term economic impact of the virus. Getting it back under control quickly avoids still more severe measures, of the kind that hadto be used from March this year, or longer periods of lesser but still damaging restrictions.Applying higher levels creates economic harm, as is painfully clear but doing so as soon asthey are needed and only until they have worked is the best way to avoid still greater harm.Measures to suppress the virus have been in place across Scotland since  October.Though it proved necessary to extend these, there are now signs justying cautiousoptimism that they are bringing the virus back under control in many parts of Scotland.Engaging Parliament, Local Government, health boards, and othersScotlandrsquos Strategic Framework sets out an approach to applying restrictions only wherenecessary, and removing them as soon as they have achieved their effect. Ministers haveset out the framework with an open mind, and have committed to engaging with Parliament,Local Government and others on its implementation.The framework itself will be debated in Parliament on Tuesday  October. In parallel,Ministers are keen to engage with Local Government before taking decisions which willaffect every community and citizen in Scotland.Ministers intend to reach final decisions later this week on both the levels set out in theframework and their application. These will be set out and implemented in regulationseffective from Monday  November, and replacing measures currently in place. Ministersintend that, from that date, each local authority area in Scotland will be placed in one of thefive levels set out in the framework.This is a rapid and challenging timescale in which to engage effectively. It is necessarybecause every day counts in suppressing the virus.There are three issues on which Ministers particularly want to engage Local Government leaders.. Reaching decisions on initial levels for local authority areas in implementing ScotlandsStrategic Framework. Understanding how levels will affect each area, and identying the areas, sectors and issues where partnership between the Scottish Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards and others can be most effective in coming weeks and for as long as the Framework remains necessary and. Gathering other comments on Scotlands Strategic Framework ahead of its implementation.While all three are important, the first is the most signicant, given the timescales. I say moreabout each below.In parallel, Ministers are also being advised by the National Incident Management Team , drawing public health expertise from Health Boards and their Directors of Public Health. Through the NIMT, Ministers have asked that Directors of Public Health support local authority Chief Executives and Leaders in their areas in responding to this request for help.Similarly, I should be gratefulChief Executives would draw on support from Directors ofPublic Health in considering this letter.Indicators and rangesScotlandrsquos Strategic Framework sets outhow Ministers propose to reach and later review decisions on initial levels for each local authority area in Scotland. These decisions are ultimately judgments for Ministers, taking account of all the facts and considerations relevant at the time they are made, in relation to the areas directly affected and for Scotland as a whole. Ministers are committed to ensuring that decisions are informedby data and analysis, and have set out the indicators they will review in reaching thesedecisions. It is our intention to keep these indicators under review and update them as, forexample, new or improved data become available or conditions change.As you know, Scottish Government analysts, working with the NIMT, expect to make available shortly a paper setting out in more detail how the indicators set out in Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework are being used to inform the levels-based approach. This will includeconsideration of how ranges can be applied to the data to signal when consideration of therelevant indicator is needed, as part of reviews of the application of levels. Decisions onlevels will, however, be judgements informed by these data and other considerations, not theresult of an algorithm. This will always be the case. I will of course share that paper withCOSLA as soon as it is available.We are also working to share data with COLSA on the social and economic structures of Local Government areas. We are drawing on these and other data to extend our ldquofour harms analysis from the whole of Scotland to inidual local authority areas. As we do so, we are committed to working closely with COSLA and SOLACE to ensure that LocalGovernment has full and transparent access to these and other data informing decisions, and to extend our ldquofour harms analysis from the whole of Scotland to inidual local authority areas so that we have a shared understanding of the effectiveness and impacts of the levels-based approach across Scotland. For that reason, COLSA and SOLACE have been invited to take part in meetings of the NIMT and of the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquoFour Harms Group of chief advisers and lead officials. I say more on this partnership approach later.. Initial levelsNo decisions have yet been made on initial levels. This is in order to allow decisions to be informed by the latest available data and public health advice. Ministers intend to set out initial levels later this week, along with a statement of reasons for these decisions, for implementation along with the levels approach from Monday  November.I hope it will be helpfulI set out the approach being taken to these decisions. The starting point is the measures currently in place. These are broadly equivalent to Level  in thecentral belt, and Level  where. Changes from these levels, whether up or down, needto be justied by the data, supported by public health advice and consistent with the ScottishGovernmentrsquos COVID- Framework for Decision-Making.Because of the severity of the impact of the measures in the highest level, Level , Ministerswill only consider using itnecessary. The data currently indicate that level of concern fortwo areas: Level  is being considered for North and South Lanarkshire. There are, however,some signs in the latest data that the situation in those areas may be stabilising. Ministerswill not reach a decision for these two areas until the latest possible point to ensure that theycan take account of the fullest possible picture of the effect of measures already in place but at this stage the use of Level  cannot be ruled out. If it was necessary, it would be used toavoid still greater harm, including many deaths.No changes are currently being considered in relation to other central belt areas. If that remains the case and is confirmed later this week, these areas would remain in Level  forthe time being. There are some signs in the data of progress in the east of the central beltarea, for example in Edinburgh and East Lothian, but some further consolidation of thatprogress is likely to be required before it would be safe, on public health grounds, to movethem to Level .The data for Dundee City also gives cause for concern, with rising numbers of cases. Again,a final decision will be made on the basis of data becoming available in the next few days.Meantime, consideration is being given to moving Dundee City to Level  in the newframework, broadly equivalent to the measures currently in place in the central belt. Furtherconsideration is also being given to the interaction between Dundee and neighbouring areas within the Tayside Health Board area.At this crucial stage in suppressing the virus, with higher case numbers, the winter approaching, and the introduction of a new strategic framework, the public health advice toMinisters is that it would not be safe to move any area straight to the lowest level, Level .There are, however, encouraging signs in the data, signaled by the indicators, in relation to some of the areas presently at Level . These are Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, andthe Western Isles. Presently, consideration is being given to moving five areas from Level to Level , with two additional safeguards. The first is maintaining ldquono in-home socialising inLevel  for a period from  November . The second is reinforcing communication of the travel advice set outin Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework in order to bear down on the risk of infection beingintroduced to these areas from areas of higher prevalence.Other areas presently at Level  would remain there on  November,the data and otherconsiderations remain unchanged in the coming few days.Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework makes clear that the levels, once introduced, are likely toremain in place for between two and four weeks, but will be reviewed weekly ndash a process inwhich we ask COSLA and SOLACE to be involved ndash in order to ensure that restrictions onlyremain in force for so long as they are justied, necessary and proportionate. We anticipatethat the first such review will take place in the week beginning Monday  November. Any proposed movement up or down the levels will be discussed with the relevant local authorityChief Executive and Council Leaders in advance of Ministers taking decisions.. PartnershipClose partnership working and a ldquoTeam Scotland approach has never been more importantthan now. We are already drawing in this crisis on structures, co-operation and commonpurpose developed over many years of working together as Resilience partners, throughSGoRR, and through Partnership Action for Continuing Employment . In the nextphase of the response to COVID-, Ministers seek local authorities rsquoviews on how best thispartnership can be focused. Ministers have in mind, and would welcome comments on, threeareas for early partnership working:. In areas facing particular challenges and impacts, we will want to work with you to support your efforts to coordinate a whole-system effort at the local level recognizing that councils are uniquely placed to do this.. We are engaging in parallel with the hospitality sector across Scotland, including Local Government for its environmental health, economic development and otherrelevant roles, building on existing close engagement and focusing on how best toensure compliance with necessary restrictions and make hospitality settings as safeas possible, recognising the particularly severe impact on this sector resulting from anecessary focus on preventing the virus spreading in indoor environments wherepeople from dferent households come into contact with each other.. Partnership working could build on ldquofour harms analysis of the impacts of the virus across Scotland and on particular areas, communities, iniduals, and business sectors, building on the analysis summarised in the attached paper and in evidenceand assessment papers published as part of the Scotlandrsquos Route Map series. Thiswork would be rooted in our commitment to understanding and acting upon theinequalities exacerbated by the pandemic.We should welcome views from local authorities on these and other priorities for partnershipworking.. Other comments on Scotlandrsquos Strategic FrameworkMinisters have set out the framework and its five levels with an open mind, and have saidthat they will consider proposals for changes to the levels. They and officials are engaging inparallel with local government, through the process described here, with Health Boards, withbusiness interests and other stakeholders, and with Parliament, which will debate and voteon the framework on Tuesday  October. Parliament will also scrutinise regulationsimplementing the framework.Ministers will therefore also welcome the view of councils on the framework as a whole, which is intended to bring greater clarity to measures to suppress the virus, making it possible to communicate these more effectively and secure the widest possible understanding, support and compliance with them. Everyone has a part to play in suppressing the virus and by playing our part, we can help reduce the level of measures needed to keep it in check.While Ministers intend that, for clarity and consistency, the same levels definitions will be used throughout Scotland for any given period, adjustments to the definitions of levels may be made from time to time. For example, the strategic framework indicates that, in somecircumstances, indoor household socialising may be prevented even at Level  , and I have said above is under consideration andrestricted hours in hospitality settings may y from time to time .Contacts and next stepsI appreciate your help and that of SOLACE in gathering view from local authorities as rapidlyas possible.The next step in that process is that you have agreed to forward this letter to every local authority chief executive today.Within the Scottish Government, this process will be led by my colleague Stephen Gallagher,with assistance from others. One of them will be in touch with each local authority chiefexecutive shortly after they receive this letter. Thereafter, Ministers will be in contact withCouncil Leaders in the course of Tuesday  and Wednesday  October.Stephen and I will continue to stay closely in touch with you and colleagues in SOLACEeach day this week.Finally, let me thank you once again for the close, constructive and positive engagement Iand my colleagues have had with you and yours as we work together in these exceptionaltimes. I could not be more grateful.Yours sincerely,KEN THOMSONDirector-General Constitution and External Affairs"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-yes-no-question-clear-used","story":"Perfectly clear and unambiguous and agreed by both sides. Everyone understood what they were voting for. The No side won and there were no complaints from the Yes side.Now that the polls are showing independence supporters to be in a clear majority the only reason that Unionist camp want to change the question is to cause confusion.What could be clearer than the original question James Duncan, Edinburgh EH.GUY Stenhouse spews nonsense. Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings are not giving greater powers to Scotland but rather are using the Brexit disaster to ram through the Internal Market Bill that destroys devolution and s all powers to a Westminster dominated by  English MPs.The bill will negatively impact Scotlands food quality, environment, education standards, law, the NHS, and even our water. An unelected quango can over-rule the Scottish Parliament, force fracking and take Scotland to court to give foreign companies access to the NHS. London wonrsquot replace the annual pound. billion Scotland receives from the EU structural fund with its paltry shared prosperity fund where the spending will be determined by Westminster with a Union flag slapped on for good measure. Condemnation of this shameless power grab has come from the NFU, TUC, STUC and the House of Lords.Mr Stenhouse says Scotland is drawing on the financial strength of the UK during this pandemic when our dependency on Westminster precludes the Scottish Government from borrowing the money to, for example, extend the furlough scheme to save thousands of jobs, as other European countries are doing. Instead, we are reduced to begging Rishi Sunak tosome of the billions we send to London to stave off economic collapse. An independent Scotlandrsquos central bank would keep its wealth, borrow the money to support its people through this crisis and invest in future growth areas like renewable energy.He refers to \"our signicant budget deficit\", when Scotland has to balance its budget and canrsquot overspend. The \"deficit\" is created by our London masters who burden us with multiple UK-wide costs we donrsquot control, including pound.bn per annum to service a UK debt we didnrsquot create nor benefit from.Words do matter. Thatrsquos why the only fair question is: ldquoShould Scotlandrsquos independence be restored  Only by restoring Scottish independence can we make our own decisions and not be ruled by a distant government that holds us back and treats us with contempt.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh EH.GUY Stenhouse states correctly that the way a question is phrased can bias the result, which he summarises as \"words matterrsquorsquo.Sadly, he is happy to use facts which are of dubious validity to back up his arguments. Let me take issue with some of them.First, apart from right-wing apologists, most commentators think that the UK Internal Market Bill will diminish rather than increase devolved powers.Secondly, he thinks that the UK is a strong player in international financial markets. Does this explain why the pound would buy   years ago and will buy . today Thirdly, and most surprisingly, he quotes a recent poll that states that % more Scots favour remaining in the UK than leaving. I have looked for this poll and failed to find it.Facts matter too, Mr Stenhouse.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.ALEX Salmondrsquos lawyer has called on the Scottish Government to publish the legal advice that it receivedbecause there is a clear public interest in reading and understanding why it spent large sums of taxpayersrsquo money in defending his court action before conceding defeat.Those who understand the court process know that legal costs increase dramatically in the lead-up to a full hearing.The Government had the benefit of advice from external lawyers, including a prominent senior counsel. Clearly it was told at some point that its position was untenable and required to be conceded. That concession took place only on January , , one week before the full hearing date and months after the action had been raised..If the Government delayed in accepting the legal advice which it had been given , that delay cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, not only in respect of Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs but the bill the Government incurred to its own lawyers.The Scottish taxpayers, as the ones who footed the bill for all of this, are surely entitled to know.George Moore, Glasgow G.Read more:Guy Stenhouse: Words matter and the independence question should be a dferent one"},{"url":null,"title":"wee-mermaid-woman-living-childhood-dream-sub-zero-waters-scottish-isles","story":"But according to a new documentary by BBC Alba, the modern-day ldquomermaid has her own YouTube channel and enjoys swimming in the sub-zero waters of Scotland in winter.Kate Macleod, from Uig on the isle of Lewis, is a wild water swimmer who uses a custom-made monofin to live out her childhood dream of being a mermaid.The -year-old braves the freezing waters of the sea and lochs on the island all year round and is just one of the islanders featured in the BBC documentary which gives a glimpse into le in the Outer Hebrides during the harsh winter months.Ms Macleod, a freelance editor who also makes films for BBC The Social, had her tail made especially by a woman in Hawaii and sometimes uses it for commercial photoshoots, as well as her own enjoyment.She said: ldquoPeople say that le is hard in the islands during the winter especially when the weather is wild and itrsquos cold and dark and itrsquos always raining.ldquoIf yoursquore wearing appropriate clothing though, and you are prepared to get wet, then itrsquos not so bad.ldquoI enjoy film making especially outdoors because it is so beautul here and I just want to share it with everyone, especially during winter.ldquoThe clouds are so dark and it makes the sea look even greener.

Many would never endure it, but for some who live here, winter brings its own light - a time of creativity, to be cherished.ldquoThis programme falls into step with artists, poets, wilderness lovers and more as they navigate their own versions of winter in this island outpost.ldquoIt can be tough but incredibly beautul and rewarding, as we hear in the stories from people in these communities.ldquoOur aim was to create a visceral, immersive viewing experience that captured the stories of those who live and thrive here, and give a sense of the landscape and the elements themselves.Trusadh: An Geamhradh Winter aired on Monday, October  at pm and is available on the BBC iPlayer for  days afterwards."},{"url":null,"title":"turkey-free-christmas-due-coronavirus","story":"The Leo McKinstry said the sense of unity that existed in the UK in the spring, during the initial lockdown, had evaporated.ldquoIndeed, with Scotland and Wales adopting their own draconian policies, the very future of the United Kingdom feels in danger, he said. ldquoYet amid all this gloom and discord, there is a real hope for the future. ldquoThe darkest hour is always just before the dawn, wrote the th-century English theologian Thomas Fuller, and his words could well apply to our current grim predicament.However, he said, thanks to the lsquobrilliant workrsquo of British scientists some people may get a vaccine before Christmas.ldquoSuch a breakthrough could ultimately completely transform the management of the disease, rendering it far less of a menace, enabling the economy to re-open and allowing ato some kind of normality, he said. ldquoThe grounds for optimism were highlighted yesterday by the leak of a memo from the NHS to a Midlands hospital trust which was instructed to ldquobe prepared to start a Covid- vaccination programme in early December.He said that judging by the outcome of rigorous trials, involving , volunteers, the jab was highly effective.ldquoBristol Universityrsquos School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine found the ldquovaccine is doing everything we expected and that is only good news in our fight against the illness, he added. ldquoIn  two Oxford scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, were at the forefront of the development of penicillin, which changed the world.ldquoNow the university could be a global saviour again.The IndependentCharlotte Rushwell, a teacher in east London, asked how she could tell her pupils that  MPs had voted against providing free school meals in the holidays.ldquoThe government can spare the cash for private firms, such as Serco, to be involved in the test and trace process but they canrsquot find the money to feed our countryrsquos poorest children, she said. ldquoI have seen first-hand families who have struggled, well before the pandemic, as well as children who came to school just for the food they could access.She said she had sneaked fruit and biscuits into childrenrsquos bags to ensure they got something to eat at the end of the day.ldquoYes, I know that free school meals are not provided normally during the holidays, but I think we can all agree that these are not normal times, she added. ldquoAt any point, any one of us could fall on hard times, and what kind of society do we live inwe are unable to help people in their time of need She said she doesnrsquot want to be part of a society where MPs can scoff a free lunch and children were going hungry.ldquoThe government might not be willing to help, but this morning I have woken up to a Facebook feed full of restaurants, cafes and local charities willing to feed our children, and I couldnrsquot be prouder, she said.ldquoMarcus Rashford has been given an honour for raising this issue and yet his plea to continue providing free meals during the holidays has been ignored. Shame on you parliament, not in my name.The Daily MailRobert Hardman said the British public had been tested to the limit during the pandemic with shortages of everything from loo rolls to baking products but had lsquomuddled throughrsquo.ldquoUntil now. For we may be fast approaching a shortage that really could do for this Government, he said. ldquoIndeed, I fear that the mere mention of it may be enough to incite public disorder. In short, two months from now, large parts of the country could be facing a Christmas with all the trimmings mdash but no turkey.He said a series of Covid related developments - including a shortage of migrant labour and people not eating out - meant demand was going one way and supply the other.ldquoThis year all the indicators are that we are going to need many more birds from an industry which could be missing half its workforce, he said. ldquoThe Governmentrsquos rule-of-six means that many families will want a smaller bird.ldquoA turkey-free Christmas  We may as well block up the chimney, leave the Christmas tree in the forest and tell the Queen not to bother come pm on December !"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmWith the COVID- situation worsening across Scotland, NHS Orkney is asking the community to think carefully before making unnecessary visits to the Balfour Hospital.

Although non-essential travel would not be allowed to or from areas at level three or above.Hospitality venues would also permitted to serve alcohol indoors and outdoors, unlike the current temporary restrictions.Level two is described as broadly similar to the current restrictions in most of Scotland, whereas level three has been compared to the situation in the central belt, where stricter measures are in place.Level four would be closer to a full lockdown, with closure of non-essential shops, although Ms Sturgeon said even those restrictions would be lesser than those introduced for the first lockdown in March.She said level four would not be used unless #absolutely necessary# when infection rates became #very high#.Ms Sturgeon said she would be listening to views from stakeholders, including local authorities and businesses.She said recent figures indicated the current restrictions were working.Although case numbers continue to rise, the rate at which they are doing so has declined to just seven per cent in the latest week # down from  per cent a fortnight ago.Ms Sturgeon said was grounds for #cautious optimism# and hoped there could be a reduction cases in the weeks ahead.She said:ldquoI know that when people hear the daily figures itrsquos easy to feel as though the hard sacrices we are all living with are not making a dference.#But by taking these dficult steps we will help suppress the virus, and that is why I am asking everyone to stick with it.Ms Sturgeon has not confirmed which tiers will apply to dferent parts of the country but is expected to do so next week.The only restrictions on travel and movement will be imposed on us ourselves while our health and businesses will be sacriced so foreign fishing companies and international energy companies can carry on unrestricted raping our hills and seas...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Most recently,  Luskentyre, which has two bedrooms, was placed on the market for offers over £,. Substantially renovated, the house was advertised as a “turnkey second home or holiday let business for the next owners”. that at the time of the community buy out in , second home ownership was a “key concern” of the organisation.“Indeed, it was one of the factors that motivated the community to act,” he added. “The community recognised the unsustainable nature of the situation at that time, with  per cent of the houses in west Harris either holiday homes or self-catering cottages.”Over the last  years that figure has increased, prompting the trust to call for west Harris to become a ‘control area’, where houses used for holiday letting would require planning consent. This is one of the proposals the Scottish Government consulted on.Mr Campbell added: “We should make it clear that we actively support crofters residing on the estate ersying into tourism to provide an income to enable them to continue to live, or in some casesto west Harris.“The trust has released land in conjunction with the grazing committees for self-build, and in partnership with Hebridean Housing Partnership. Six houses for rent and four houses under shared ownership have been built, resulting in the population increasing by  per cent over the  years of ownership.”However, the trust remains concerned that the ever-increasing prices being realised for crofts and houses make it very dficult for young people to remain in the community.“It is hoped that this legislation can be used to keep existing houses under permanent residence rather than becoming holiday homes,” Mr Campbell added.After analysing the consultation’s finding, the Scottish Government will introduce the agreed changes in April of next year."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Scotland-Football-Team-credit-SCOTLANDNATIONALTEAM-TWITTER-web.jpg","title":"why i have stopped watching scotland at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY NORRIE T MACDONALDSpeaking last week about how football, the only sport I really thought I knew anything about, had undergone such a radical transformation, made me examine my perceptions about other sports.When it comes to their rules, am I completely at ease that I actually know what’s going on Heck no. Are you Football used to be very basic and straightforward, offside was the only really complicated bit and I understood it perfectly when black was black and white was white: now I don’t even comprehend what it is that’s happening with the competitions that our teamsparticipate in.What were we playing in over last weekend How many back doors are we being offered now to make it to the European Championships Is it a back door What is the Nations League and how is our group made up only of ‘diddy’ teams like ourselves Why are Spain playing Portugal, England-Belgium, while we appear to be in a group with countries younger than my mother What even is the Nations League, and are UEFA  FIFA simply intent on giving every single team as many possibilities as they can to qualy for a finals, no matter how meaningless I have to be honest, I’ve stopped watching Scotland.If I don’t know most of the players, don’t understand the rules any more, and don’t know what competition we’re playing in, why would I Doubtless Steve Clarke will be put to the sword when he cannot manage to come close to manufacturing even a plastic purse from an often-depleted squad, certainly one devoid of enough major talent to progress.And repeat.Do I know what’s going on in a rugby match Calm down.I get completely flummoxed by some of the decisions and nuances of their laws.But then again, it’s not my game and the understanding of the rules of any sport where my interest is merely in the passing, often confounds my ‘enjoyment’ of it.Basketball too.I’ve even been to more Orlando Magic gamesthan I’ve attended rugby matches in my own country.But don’t even start me on their biggest sport, baseball, which is as confusing to me as backgammon and bridge combined.It’s basically a ball and a bat, running round a diamond and more statistics than are currently being thrown at us by the chief medical officer and Boris.I simply cannot get into it.But then again, I was never meant to.Where the premise is simplethen there shouldn’t be too many rules necessary to prevent us enjoying what originally started out as some fun, some exercise, a pastime.They began with just fiveand progressed to .Nowadays offside itself takes up more definition than the original five in their entirety.When it comes to golf, there is a whole handbook.A radical overhaul recently has seen some of the silliness eradicated and the original  rules, outlined in just  words, have been reduced to just a small, compact, encyclopaedia.I was recently at a golf quiz where, of the  questions asked, I was proficient in less than a third .Try explaining stableford or a par bogey competition against the course to a Martian.Give me cricket and I have a clue.It’s quite simple.I have an old, framed, tea-towel in my shed which proclaims them thus: ‘You have two sides, one out in the field and one in.‘When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in.‘There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out.‘When both sides have been in and all the men have out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game!’See It’s important to know the rules, what their purpose is and how to best interpret them so as to understand what it is that’s going on in the field.Isn’t it RULES OUT THE WINDOWThe rules appear to fly out the window down at Askernish where their correspondent, captain and current winner of just about everything, happens to be the same guy.He could just be making it all up, sending me bogus reports and watching his star rise, while bewildered colleagues helplessly look on.They say that history is written by the winners, but the reality is nowadays that it is written by those with the only pen.From Colin Russell, a man who can be described in many adjectives, not all of them beginning with the same letter.Alliteration can be a tricky path.I jest, however, he indeed is having a sterling month.ROAD TO HARRISScarista on Saturday saw the second instalment of their Road to Harris competition and it was with a deal of excitement that I made it down for the first time in a month.It was blowing a hoolieand any bad hole would be quickly consigned to the bin.The par bogey format has its compensations.Winner on the day, continuing his recent fine form, was Murdo F MacLeod who finished + versus the course.He managed to prevail on countbackfrom a pack including Russell Tennant and Kenny ‘Kuna’ Morrison.Melanie Duff finished second.Congratulations are due to Grant Fulton, Scarista member and son of ‘The Bold’ for his recent elevation to elected member for the

several months at a time does imbue a swing-rustiness which only lager and practice can eradicate. days quarantine doesn’t help either.One thing is for certain it doesn’t, ever, wipe the smile off his face.His -point total for a win last Wednesday contained an eagle, no less , and a scattering of par golf which contributed massively to his tally in the October stableford.Martyn Macleod required no such measuring tape to gauge the distance between himself and second place on Saturday his beautul , edging Donald ‘Sweeney’ MacSween  by clear distance.His only real blemish was an untidy double at

minutes to put the contest to bed before half-time.After leaving her marker for dead following a powerful run down the left-wing, MacRae fired high into the net to open the scoring.Her second came from a finely timed run in which she burst past the Westdyke defence to latch onto a pass from deep and, unruffled by the outrushing keeper, kept her cool to slot the ball low into the net to make it -.She completed her hat-trick with another powerful shot, this time after a brilliantly cushioned pass from the right-hand side played her into the box. Taking one touch MacRae set herself up before lashing a venomous right-foot strike beyond the Westdyke keeper.Her fourth goal owed more to good positioning than style as she kept her nerve to tuck away a tap-in past the beleaguered opposition keeper.Kayleigh MacKenzie then added a fth for the Caley Jags to cap off an emphatic start to the season for the Highlanders.Commenting on MacRae’s dream debut, ICTWFC coach Karen Mason told the Free Press: “It was a very pleasing start to the season, to say the least!“Lorna’s debut couldn’t have gone any better for her, four goals within the opening  minutes with some great finishes in amongst them.She added: “She is going to be a real asset to us this season with her pace, power, and tenacity. She will definitely run defences ragged throughout the campaign.”Caley’s next fixture is scheduled for Sunday th October when they will take on Cove Rangers FCW away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PROFILE-MORAG-HANNAH-3.jpg","title":"forbes seeks radical improvement to universal credit as island claims","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY ADAM GORDONFigures from Highland Council showed a  per cent increase in claims for welfare recorded by the Portree job centre between Marchand August .Sixteen to  year-olds and - year-olds have been the worst affected groups, with the number of people within both claimant brackets having risen by more than  per cent between March and August.In the - year-old age group the figure rose by a staggering  per cent — with  claims made in March and  made in August. The number spiked at  claims in July.Meanwhile the statistics for the - year-olds category also painted a worrying trend with a  per cent rise recorded between March and August. March saw , claims made, while that number escalated to , in August.The overall figures show that Portree job centre experienced the greatest rise in claims between March and August at  per cent, with Fort William the next greatest at  per cent of the six centres listed.The total number for the Highlands as a whole climbed from , in March to , in August. The greatest figure for the region across that period came in July when the number rose to ,.On Monday, Highland Council Leader Margaret Davidson said that the region has been hit hard by the many shortfalls arising from the UK Government’s benefit scheme.Reacting to the figures, Kate Forbes said: “The pandemic has a huge social and economic impact. Many people, particularly young people, have found themselves dependent on universal credit.“Some of those who are reliant on universal credit for the first time in their lives have told me that they cannot believe the UK Government expects anybody to live off the small weekly sums.“There have been some improvements to universal credit but these have been minimal and it is critical that the UK Government not only maintains those changes, but radically improves universal credit so that families and iniduals can survive.“As redundancies increase in advance of the end of the furlough scheme, the Scottish Government has sought to provide employability support. However, it would be far better to keep people in work in the first place.She added: “If anybody is struggling to access universal credit or finds themselves with nowhere  to go, I would encourage them to get in touch with my office and I will do everything I possibly can to help.”The bureau manager at the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau has said changes need to be made to the Universal Credit system to halt the “desperate cycle of debt and destitution”.: “The Universal Credit monthly standard allowance for those aged under  years is £. – some people may get more money on top of the standard allowance – housing costs,eligible, with the claimant possibly having to wait for around five weeks for the first payment.“They can ask for an advance, but this must be paid back.“Claims for Universal Credit must normally be made and maintained online. Alternative, offline options are only available in exceptional circumstances. Many claimants are in financial dficulty before they apply for Universal Credit, with some delaying making their claim until they are in dficulty.“The department’s analysis of earnings data found that nearly half of claimants –  per cent — had no earnings in the three months before they apply for Universal Credit.“The initial five-week wait can exacerbate claimants’ debt and financial dficulties.”She explained that since Universal Credit was introduced, evidence from the CAB has suggested that a signicant minority of people do not have the internet access or digital skills required to make and maintain their claims online.She said: “Within this group, those with disabilities, mental or physical health conditions, learning dficulties, poor literacy skills and other complex needs, appear to face particular disadvantages and barriers to online claim maintenance.“In fact, some simply may never be able to do so without substantial support. Those living in rural areas can also face unique dficulties. Such claimants can therefore be at serious risk of sanction , which can result in signicant hardship.“The UK government does offer an advance loan system so people can access cash sooner. But that simply adds another line of credit to people’s outgoings and pushes them further into that debt spiral. Our evidence base tells us that it is dficult to get by on Universal Credit even before your advance loan repayments are deducted.”Since th March this year the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau have dealt with , client contacts,  per cent of these contacts –  client contacts — have been with regards to Universal Credit – people looking for advice on advance payments, reporting changes of circumstances, needing assistance with claiming and backdating, getting help with the housing element, how to supply medical evidence that they are unfit to look for work, online access issues, payment issues schedules, reconsiderations and work capability assessments.Ms Hannah added: “We believe that advance loans should be replaced by a non-repayable payment system that protects the most vulnerable from destitution – like having to rely on food banks – during the waiting period.“Alongside this, it makes much more sense for people to just get their first payment sooner we say within two weeks. Provide suitable non-digital options for iniduals to make and manage their Universal Credit claims and promote these options to claimants, particularly disabled people, people with health conditions and other complex needs.“Get it wrong and we will continue to see people in the same desperate cycle of debt and destitution, but get it right and we can begin to reverse the trend of working poverty.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3411600.jpg--.jpg?1602676940000\n","title":"austin s cycle raises 1 580 for diabetes uk","story":"AUSTIN Graham’s  miles sponsored cycle ride has raised over pound, for Diabetes UK!The -year-old Ballymena man completed his journey last Tuesday night.“I set myself the target of  miles to be completed during the month of September,” outlined Austin.“I put the finishing touches on completing it last week and am delighted that I raised more than my original pound, target.”His total amount raised is pound,Austin, himself a diabetic, thanks everyone single person who donated.“The money is going to Diabetes UK, a very worthy cause.

But he was delighted to be steered on to the Diabetes UK’s Cycle for September. Austin signed up for the  miles - and had the full month of September to pedal this distance, and collect sponsorship for Diabetes UK along the way.The Digital Sales and Marketing man at Algram in Railway Street, Ballymena, was more than busy at work and admitted finding it tough to get the time to cycle.Eighteen years ago he was diagnosed with Type  diabetes.“This obviously was a big change not just for me but for my family and those around me too,” outlined Austin. “I’ve always been into sport whether it’s football, rugby, golf or cycling and I felt that cycling  miles throughout the month of September was a great way for me to raise money for Diabetes UK and give a little back.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1602771523139.jpg--mayor_praises_schoolboys_for_their_heroic_actions.jpg?1602771532000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20201015newsmayor praises schoolboys for their heroic actions","story":"THE Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council has formally honoured four teenagers who rescued a father and his two children from the sea at White Park Bay earlier this year.

The claim is a positive given that the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, the pharmaceutical company said.A company spokesman said: It#s encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity [vaccine reaction] was lower in older adults, where the Covid- disease severity is higher.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHealth Secretary Matt Hancock FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHealth Secretary Matt HancockHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday it is his central expectation that the majority of the roll-out of a vaccine could be under way in the first half of , stressing the bulk of the programme could happen before next summer.When asked about reports that hospitals are preparing to vaccinate staff, Mr Hancock told the BBC that it#s not my central expectation that we#ll be doing that this year. He added: We don#t know when the first vaccine will be available but my central expectation is in the first half of next year.A Department of Health spokesperson here said the Government has secured access to six potential Covid- candidates.This reflects the UK#s strategy to ensure we have a supply of vaccines should any of these prove safe and effective, they said. The vaccines are currently at ious stages of the human trials that they must complete before they can be considered for use in a vaccination programme.The best case scenario is that we will have a vaccine in use before the end of the year and we are currently planning on that basis, however, realistically it may be next year before sufficient doses are available to vaccinate on a large scale.Professor Ultan Power, Professor of Molecular Virology at Queen#s University, warned it is very dficult to estimate when a vaccine will be made available.He said regardless of any estimated roll-out, it is crucial that the third trial of any vaccine candidate meets all safety requirements. A lot depends on the safety profile of phase three. If it is successful and safe, and its efficacy is assured then there should be no problem, he said.Professor Power also emphasised the roll-out of a vaccine will depend on an effective manufacturing process. Another factor, he argued, is the willingness of the public to have the vaccine.

So, as a famous Narnian lion once said: Courage, dear heart.Lockdown has taught us a myriad of ways to give ourselves a little boost in the coming weeks - and here are just some of the things that will get us through.. Order a fancy takeawayWhile we gave up our meals out in the first lockdown, it was a welcometo normality to see our favourite restaurants reopening their doors over the summer - not to mention a respite from the endless cooking and washing up. Many of Northern Ireland#s finest restaurants launched delivery services back in the spring and are still doing so, including the wonderful Cathedral Quarter restaurant Coppi, delivering At Home with Coppi meals throughout Northern Ireland.Noble in Holywood is offering its hugely popular Cook@Home packs, with everything you need to create your own fine dining experience, and Bronagh Duffin at the Bakehouse in Bellaghy is delivering afternoon teas for two throughout the province. Check out the #Who is delivering  Northern Ireland# Facebook page for details of eateries offering deliveries.. Embrace hyggeEven without a pandemic, the best way to make it through the winter is to pile on the tartan blankets, get a few scented candles on the go and enjoy a steaming hot chocolate with a touch of mood lighting.And there is no shortage of local businesses that can help you create the perfect ambience. For example, award-winning start-up Jasmine  Lily Floral Wreaths has really seen demand soaring during lockdown as people decorated their homes with its delicious handmade faux floral wreaths.. Discover the new Scandi craze, friluftslivWhile hygge is all about being content and cosy in your home, you may feel more in tune with the new lestyle mood, Norway#s friluftslivcelebrating outdoor activities. Now is the time to get the boots on, blow away the cobwebs and kick a few autumn leaves about.National Trust properties across Northern Ireland are open to visitors this Halloween as long as they pre-book, including the Forager#s Trail at Castle Ward and the traditional orchard at Florence Court, not to mention some of its lesser-known walking spots, such as Lisnabreeny Rath and Minnowburn in Belfast.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNational Trust properties like Castleward are open FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNational Trust properties like Castleward are open . Discover a podcastIs your daily walk getting a bit samey  Liven it up with a podcast - there are multitudes of fascinating homegrown podcasts that you can immerse yourself in, many of them free to download.Humorous offerings include Shane Todd#s Tea With Me and Boy Town podcasts and the General Banter podcast, with stand-up comedian Colin Geddis. Meanwhile, the Best of Belfast podcast features weekly hour-long unfiltered conversations with everyone from Oscar-winning directors, Silicon Valley CEOs and Michelin Star chefs to -year-old park-runners, while Emer Maguire goes head to head with her mum across the generation gap in her Millennial Versus Mum podcast.. Spruce up the gardenJust because the nights are closing in doesn#t mean you have to shut yourself away from your garden haven.

These issues, compounded by the ongoing health pandemic, has resulted in immense strain being placed on the service. I raised the concerns of the Ambulance Service directly with the Health Minister. Giving the worrying figures noted by the Health Minister of the limited capacity of Rapid Response Vehicles and ambulances during recent months, it is crucially important that the Minister urgently intervenes to provide maximum support to NIAS and ensures that the service is properly resourced.NIAS warned in July that it was facing increased challenges in maintaining planned levels of cover across all of its isions in Northern Ireland, meaning that response times to some calls would be delayed.It outlined a range of reasons for the drop in staff cover and delayed response times.This included increased use of NIAS services over recent years without an increase in staffing levels, % of frontline staff being absent due to ordinary sickness or reasons related to Covid-, annual leave commitments, assaults on staff and similar issues facing Trust staff.NIAS chief executive Michael Bloomfield has appealed for support from politicians to ensure that ambulances remain available to respond to le-threatening emergencies.

Connaire McGreevy, spokesperson for the Mourne AONB Against Wind Farms group, said it was concerning.“It’s a huge sum of money, particularly when there’s so many people who have been excluded from grant support,” he said.“To see wind turbines being grant-funded just begs lots more questions around the entire energy industry.”He said all wind turbine development should be halted until a full investigation is carried out.Mr Dickson said it was possible that many more businesses had been paid in error and that getting the money back could be dficult.“I think the reality is that payments were made in a very big rush back in March,” he said.“Politicians and the media were calling for urgent action to keep businesses afloat and to allow employees to be paid.“Regrettably it was inevitable that mistakes would be made. What now needs to be done is that those mistakes can be rectied and that we can be sure public money is spent properly and given to the right people.”He added: “I’m not quite sure how you go backwards. Will it require a change in the regulations to recoup that money becauseit was properly made at the time then I’m not quite sure what you can do about it.“Obviously there’s a range of issues here from wind turbines to anaerobic digesters. It may very well be that there were other categories of businesses who may have received funds.”Mr Beggs said it was “outrageous” that over £, was paid out to turbine owners when many businesses in need got nothing. He called on Diane Dodds to find out how the error occurred, recoup the money and give clarity on whether the £, grant was given to other energy generators — and ensure the “fiasco” was not repeated.A department spokesperson said the “necessary, swt action” to support thousands of businesses in crisis was taken with £m paid out to over , businesses.They added that “the unprecedented speed and scale” of the Executive’s response to the pandemic had been acknowledged by Comptroller and Auditor General Kieran Donnelly.The department said it would “where possible seek to recover any funding that may have been paid to those deemed ineligible to receive payment”.

Picture Margaret McLaughlin -- FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA Garda checkpoint on the Irish border at Lford bridge in Co-Donegal on Saturday evening, just a few yards from Strabane in Northern Ireland. Picture Margaret McLaughlin --Lisa SmythTwitterOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA former health minister has dismissed a call for serious consideration to be given to closing the border with the Republic of Ireland to tackle the spread of Covid-. DUP MLA Jim Wells said he does not believe the measure would be effective at reducing the number of positive cases, while a total ban on non-essential travel would be more effective.It comes after a consultant in public health in Australia said Ireland should close its borders, including the frontier with Northern Ireland, to tackle Covid-.A further eight people in Northern Ireland have died after testing positive for Covid- and  new cases of the virus were reported yesterday.According to the figures, the number of cases in Derry and Strabane between October  and  dropped by , but it still has the highest number of positive cases per , of the population.Meanwhile, the number of positive cases in Mid Ulster is continuing to climb - it now has the second highest number of positive cases per , of the population, with  people diagnosed with the virus between October  and .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp  In total, , people have tested positive across Northern Ireland in the last seven days.There were  patients with Covid- in hospitals across Northern Ireland yesterday, with  in intensive care.A total of  care homes are dealing with Covid- outbreaks, with  further suspected outbreaks in others.The figures were released as Niall Conroy, a consultant in public health medicine working in Queensland, said Australia has reduced the spread of Covid- more effectively than many other nations by limiting and monitoring those entering the country.Speaking to the Sunday Independent, he said: In Queensland, we have had about , cases of Covid in total, with six deaths.That#s because, early on, we implemented mandatory hotel quarantine for new arrivals coming into the country, he added.What that means, in practice, is that you catch new cases on their way into Australia, where you can isolate them. Then the public health units can get on with managing the cases that were already here.We think this is essential as otherwise it#s like trying to manage a flood in your bathroom while the tap is still running.Imported cases cause a lot of new transmission chains, so it#s very dficult to get your case numbers down while new cases are continually coming into the country.Giving his thoughts on how Ireland could tackle Covid-, he continued: My solution would be to look at the possibility of elimination.Let#s properly engage with Northern Ireland, the UK and Europe to seethe border controls could be a possibility. Let#s engage civil society in Northern Ireland and seewe can get them on board.However, Mr Wells, who no longer holds the DUP whip, said he was not convinced it will reduce the number of cases.What we should be doing is restricting all non-essential travel instead of just recommending against it and people should be told that, unless it is absolutely necessary, they shouldn#t be going out, he said.The statistics suggest that it is socialising within households that is a signicant problem and that doesn#t really involve the border. The real issue is people going out and buying alcohol to drink at a house party and closing the border isn#t going to prevent that.Colm Gildernew, chair of the Stormont health committee, has also rejected the suggestion that closing the border would help reduce the spread of Covid-.Instead, the Sinn Fein MLA reiterated calls for an all-Ireland strategy to suppress the virus.All decisions in our fight back against Covid- are based upon scientic and medical advice, he said.The island of Ireland is a single epidemiological unit and our response should be coordinated on an island-wide basis.People in border communities regularly cross the border to work, care for relatives and buy essential supplies. As with all areas across the island, people should only travel when necessary at this time. This is a pandemic which does not recognise borders and neither should our response to it.Colin McGrath, who is also a member of the Stormont health committee, said closing the Irish border would damage public support for the regulations already in place, coming at a time when health officials are working hard to encourage the public to adhere to guidance.I think it would be an unnecessary distraction from our common goal of trying to collectively fight this virus, said the SDLP South Down MLA.As efforts to bring the virus under control in Northern Ireland continue, health minister Robin Swann last night said that ensuring children are safe and receiving the care they need during the pandemic must be a key priority for society. Measures that have been put into place include a change in legislation to make it possible for social workers to complete their work within longer timescales or to deliver services in dferent ways.Belfast Most ReadMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedPoll: NHS could be crucial in border poll with support for united Ireland and the Union running neck-and-neckExpelled UVF boss beat up ex in street... drug-dealing coward dragged victim by hair as he drove off in carNorthern Ireland street cleaner who quizzed boy about sex makes a break for it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Brexit vote had just happened and Theresa May had just become Prime Minister.At Good Morning Britain, we weren#t quite down the mines, but -hour overnight marathon shts eight or nine times a month were starting to take their toll after two fascinating years on the programme.Little did I know as my email made its way to Number  supremo Fiona Hill that just weeks later I would be starting an exciting new le as special adviser to Secretary of State James Brokenshire.When he very sadly had to resign due to lung cancer  months later, I worked very briefly for his successor, Karen Bradley, even more briefly for Home Secretary Amber Rudd and then, having recovered from cancer, James came back into the Cabinet as Housing Secretary and asked me to serve alongside him again at his new department.I spent nearly three years in total working for James before he was sacked when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, after which I was transferred to the Ministry of Justice to work for the Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland.But in July , the entirety of this crazy, draining and incredibly interesting le was all ahead of me.Emailing Fiona, I had absolutely nothing to lose - except those dreaded, draining night shts on Good Morning Britain.I had always loved politics, leaping at the chance to do the subject at A-level under an inspiring teacher at Portadown College, Sean Dunlop. Later, when I was Spad at the Ministry of Justice, I had a group of Sean#s students into the Lord Chancellor#s office when they were over in London on a school trip. I#m afraid I breached protocol by allowing my former teacher to try on the Lord Chancellor#s wig, much to the amusement of his students and colleagues. Sean was game for a laugh as always, smiling happily as the students snapped away on their phones.I#d watched the news almost from infancy, and indeed remember aged five writing to - and receiving a reply from - UTV#s Paul Clark.But  years into my career, having known, met and sometimes become friends with Spads, I had done most of what I wanted to do in journalism. I had written suggested questions for Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight as my first proper job, worked for the BBC in Washington, New York, Belfast and London, been senior producer on Question Time aged  and been a reporter for five years too, on both radio and telly, reporting from Downing Street and the White House.Having interviewed everyone from Cate Blanchett to Timmy Mallett, I fancied a change.TV reporting especially is a ruthless game - your face either fits or it does not.Sometimes in my career it did, sometimes it did not, and that could change with the wind - as I and others painfully learned, it was not always the survival of the fittest.It was just  hours after my initial email that a reply came from Fiona Hill informing me, rather directly, that: James Brokenshire is about to ring you. James had been appointed Northern Ireland Secretary about  days previously, but I didn#t know him from Adam, and he, similarly, couldn#t have picked me out of a police line-up.Mildly panicking that I was about to be rung by a Cabinet minister, we actually missed each other#s calls, eventually speaking briefly and arranging to meet two days later in the plush surroundings of the five-star Corinthia Hotel in Westminster.Remarkably, it was just a week between our gin and tonic at the Corinthia Hotel and my confirmation as special adviser to the Secretary of State.As I was to learn, Spads in Westminster play a weird daily role to their ministers, somewhere between friend, gatekeeper, adviser and general dogsbody. As his media Spad, I was to advise James both on what to say in the crucial .am interview on the Today programme as well as reminding him to have a pee beforehand.As part of what I dubbed #The Brokenshire Travelling Circus# we generally operated a #where James goes I go# rule, the frequency of travel between Belfast and London one of the things that struck me the most when I first started the job at the NIO.But of course the travel is entirely necessary for the Northern Ireland Secretary to do the job. In  I took  flights for work, mostly between London and Belfast, but occasionally we travelled to Dublin and Brussels too, as we had many meetings with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and EU figures such as Michel Barnier about Brexit.It wasn#t the best carbon footprint, but the upsides were that the very nice flight attendants on Aer Lingus knew how I liked my teaand I can still recite the Aer Lingus and British Airways safety instruction presentation by heart. Indeed, one Aer Lingus flight attendant, a lovely woman called Louise Annon, even became my Facebook friend.The Northern Ireland Secretary also comes with a few friends - his or her police protection officers, who are with them  , whether out and about, in the office or staying at home or Hillsborough Castle, where James and I often stayed overnight in the beautul flats.Sadly, you are not allowed to sleep in the Queen#s bed any more, as I was told former Chancellor George Osborne once did.James#s protection officers got on well with him, but the   nature really is exactly that. So when the officers accompanied the family one afternoon on a trip to Chessington World of Adventures for one of the Brokenshire children#s birthdays, the following Monday, James joked that his officers were too scared to go on the rollercoasters - an experience each of them had, sadly, declined. The officers often dwarfed James, who is ft ins tall and mockingly refers to himself as #The Hobbit from the Broken-shire#. With this in mind, the Monday morning after the family theme park visit, I asked the assembled officers: So, was James tall enough for the rides then Le at the Northern Ireland Office wasn#t always a laughing matter, of course, and the collapse of Stormont in January  necessitated a lot more time in intensive talks with figures such as Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams - the terrorist bogeymen of my youth - and Arlene Foster, all of whom I had interviewed as a journalist. But of course it is very dferent to be across the table from these people helping to negotiate than shoving a UTV or BBC Northern Ireland microphone in their face.The scheduling of the election in  unhelpfully stalled these talks, but working on the Conservative Party#s campaign set the stage for one of the most special days I had working with James.That was May , , when I accompanied James to the Balmoral Show for a campaign visit alongside then Prime Minister Theresa May. James and Mrs May were mobbed as they walked through the tented stands on the gloriously sunny day, sampling the fine fare and chatting with stallholders. Arlene Foster was also there, and heard the PM was also attending that day and came up to say hello. Later, we were accused of stage managing the meeting, but that was not so. with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"Insider: Peter Cardwellwith Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappInsider: Peter Cardwellwith Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in  At one stage, just in advance of some planned media interviews with the Prime Minister, someone realised no private briefing space had been set aside for Mrs May to go over what might be asked, something that is done before every media interview.Quick as a flash, Home Office Spad Mo Hussein convinced a stallholder in one of the gazebos to allow us to brief the PM in a tiny area where stock was stored.It was a tad surreal for me going through the lines on Northern Ireland and Brexit with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as she sat on a plastic chair surrounded by boxes containing hundreds of bags of Tayto cheese and onion crisps. But the interviews were word-perfect and we breathed a sigh of relief afterwards.I was used to travelling with James and his protection officers, but with the Prime Minister it is a more elaborate affair. There is a long convoy of numerous vehicles, what the Americans call a motorcade. The Northern Ireland visit was the first time I had travelled with police motorcycle outriders and their flashing blue lights, and it really was quite cool as they sped alongside us. The Prime Minister was only in Northern Ireland for a few hours, but I will remember that bright, brilliant day for a letime.The Secret Le of Special Advisers, by Peter Cardwell, is published by Biteback tomorrow  Belfast   Most ReadMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedPoll: NHS could be crucial in border poll with support for united Ireland and the Union running neck-and-neckExpelled UVF boss beat up ex in street... drug-dealing coward dragged victim by hair as he drove off in carNorthern Ireland street cleaner who quizzed boy about sex makes a break for it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Neil McCafferty has underlying health conditions including a heart problem and diabetes and is therefore in several at-risk categories. Upon entering the hospital the -year-old was Covid negative but has now contracted the virus. Mr McCafferty is a father of five to son Michael and four daughters, Andrea, Karen, Sinead and Emma. When added to his other health conditions his family believe it will take a ‘miracle’ for him to survive. googletag.cmd.push Since the start of the pandemic, the now retired man has adhered to all the rules by shielding and when society reopened took every precaution, deciding to spend most of his time at home. The heartbroken family say that he was the one they were trying to protect throughout. His son Michael said: “Ma dad is not good, all we can do is hope, but there’s not much hope there.” Mr McCafferty’s his we Bridieadded: “Put it this way, it would take a big, big miracle for my husband to survive this.”  They made it clear that this is ‘not criticism of the NHS’ but a means of highlighting complacency in the community and government failures. googletag.cmd.push Michael explained: “This is about awareness of wearing masks, about social distancing, about trying to keep people out of hospital who don’t need to be there. “This is about a liaison officer being at the hospital to inform families about their loved one’s condition during this dficult time when you can’t be there to hold their hand. “And it’s about people not having house parties or gatherings.” COMMUNICATION Lack of communication meant the family were unaware that their husband and father was on dialysis as the infection was ‘attacking his kidneys’. The next day they discovered that he had developed sepsis which is a potentially le-threatening condition caused by the bodys response to an infection.     His son raised concerns that while dropping off medication for his fathers diabetes some hospital staff were not wearing masks. They believe that with the rise in local cases extra precautions should be taken in Derry, especially inside the hospital. “Retail and hospitality staff who aren’t in direct contact with you have to wear a mask. “But when I went into a hospital these people weren’t wearing masks, it doesn’t make sense,” Michael said. On Monday morning they found out that their dad had ‘taken a turn’ during the night and had been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit . A consultant assured the family that negative Covid tests had been ed twice but the infection was ‘really bad’. He was ventilated for fluid in the lungs, kidneys being worked on through dialysis and they were trying to give him strong antibiotics to fight the infection. They tried phoning for hours to get an update when at .pm on October  they were informed that he had contracted Covid. Now, more than ever, when people cant visit sick friends or relatives they believe that better communication is needed from the Trust to provide updates on their condition and peace of mind. Bridie commented: “There has been a lack of communication. My husband couldn’t communicate to me because he wasn’t very lucid, he was telling me that he got his kidney drained and a young nurse or receptionist told me that no it was his gall bladder. “No doctor phoned me to tell me that he had sepsis, no doctor phoned me to tell me that he was getting dialysis, no doctor phoned me until last night to tell me that he had Covid but we had to chase it up. “If I was allowed, I’m not saying we should be, butI seen my husband and the way he was deteriorating I could demand to see a doctor. “But it’s lack of communication, there should be some type of family liaison to let you know what is going on.” She continued: “I understand that doctors and nurses sign up to take care of people, they don’t sign up to go into work and take their own lives in their hands. “At the very start, hotels were open to hospital staff, BBs were open to them, they were all shielding but now that’s not happening when it’s re. I just don’t understand it.” After the Derry News contacted the Trust about the family’s concerns they did receive a positive call from a nurse who provided a comprehensive update. ‘PERFECT FATHER’  The family collectively understand the exceptional times we’re living in but believe there is still room for a compassionate approach. Michael said: “These are dficult times but it takes the humanity away from it when in normal circumstances,this is his last few days of le, we could be there holding his hand. “I went back to leave a phone charger for him and asked could I go in to see him and was told ‘no, you’re not allowed’, and that’s the last time I’ll probably see him.” Her voice shaking with emotion, Bridie paid tribute to her husband: “People always think their parents are the best in the world, but I’m telling you now, they have a perfect father. “He would do anything for them.” In tears his daughters explained that their father was the kindest man who cared for people. Recently he did everything in his power to help -year-old Derry man, Blian Bowe, who was in an induced coma because of Coronavirus. Mr McCafferty’s daughter Emma said: “We do not want any other family to go through this. “He shielded all during lockdown and when it was lted he wore a mask and wasn’t going out to places he shouldn’t have been. “But he has gone in there and contracted Covid, with the underlying issues he might not have got out but this has just put a tonne of bricks on top of his other issues. “We want people to take responsibility. It’s not about contracting it. Somebody could go into the hospital with a sore toe and not come out. “There are a lot of staff off shielding too, this is not an attack on the NHS or a personal attack on any nurses, it’s about people understanding the seriousness of this now and making the right decisions about whether or not to go to hospital. “Andthey do, they have to take extra care.” Michael concluded: “This is directed at the government. We need another full lockdown, we need what I call a time-stop. “Send everybody home, stop mortgages and so on and give people a small subsidy for food. “This is not the Spanish flu this is worse, because people will not abide by the rules and respect what it is. “The government is trying to look after the economy. To put everybody in their homes again will damage the economy, but to put everyone out to work will damage it even more because it will put enormous pressure on the NHS and thousands of people will be off work sick.”  TRUST RESPONSE The Trust was asked to respond to the families concerns. In particular, given that visiting was suspended during the first wave of the virus, whether the Trust had used the time in between to establish a communication channel for families to ensure they have updates. Due to the ‘overwhelming number of media queries’ the Trust is receiving at present, a spokesperson said it was unable to provide a direct response. However, it did point out that visiting was suspended from October  until further notice. The Trust acknowledged that it is a ‘dficult time’ for the public and said that ‘virtual visits’ can be arranged. Visiting will only be permitted under very special circumstances at Altnagelvin Hospital including in paediatrics, maternity, palliative care and dementia  learning disability. “Our priority is to safeguard and protect people who are receiving care and also to protect our staff. “If you are permitted to visit under special circumstances you MUST wear a face covering, thoroughly wash your hands or use sanitiser when entering and exiting Altnagelvin Hospital,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In one regard, last Saturday was an exciting day for Derry. Beating Longford was irrelevant, it was the manner that was important. Rory Gallagher handed out another four league debuts, taking his total to . There were  dferent scorers. No longer will Shane McGuigan have to carry them around on his square, but young shoulders. Ethan Doherty put in a tremendous sht on his debut. Paul Cassidy marked his first senior outing by thumping home a goal. It took Patrick Kearney four years to break into the side and on his first league start, he smashed to the net. googletag.cmd.push Oisin McWilliams showed some glimpses when he came on, adding to the fine season with Swatragh. Add in Conor McCluskey, who didnt start. Hes been sensational in the last two seasons for Magherafelt. Of the  players used, only Niall Loughlin, Paul Cassidy and Gavin ONeill have not played in a senior county final, an Ulster U U or minor final. Then there was the Glass factor. Australias loss is Glen and Derrys gain. He was involved in the move that led to Cassidys goal. He won a free for Loughlin to tap over and looked like a man among boys when he caught a mark in Derrys defence. And he is a top notch guy to boot. googletag.cmd.push It was the sort of performance that, only the gates are closed to fans, wouldve brought a following to Tullamore on Sunday. Armagh in the championship will be a step up, but, for me, it is the perfect championship draw. Thats the positive side of Saturday. The email clubs received earlier in the day tells them where exactly they sit in the pecking order. Derry CCC, following on from the GAAs lead, informed them that the underage gradings for the  will be changed to U, U and U. What a kick in the teeth on so many fronts. The GAA can dress U U and Development League and Championships up all they want, this ruling means that those who played their last year of U football in  are now senior players.     Magherafelt were A champions at U last year, the same season they had a senior  of , of which its hard to see anyone outside of Joe Keenan, Jared Monaghan and Darren ONeill considering retirement. The trio mentioned...why would they leave a squad that has competed in the last two senior finals  For that same county senior final, Glen had  players listed in the programme. They were also in the minor final and with Conor Glass home from Oz, with the lure of a new manager always bringing players out from everywhere – where are the players who are over the bar for U going to fit. They have reportedly  players overage for U next season.. Under the old system, it wouldve been nine. Clubs like Limavady, Ballinascreen and Dungiven are the same. Who is going to stick around and fully commit to an U team. The only people rubbing their hands here are Dungiven Celtic, Draperstown Celtic, Rainey Old Boys and the ious other non-GAA clubs who will be able to avail of a set of players craving two sessions a week and a game at the weekend. In smaller clubs, the pool of players for an U or U team might not be there, given the need for promising players to be parachuted straight into the senior team. There will be an element that sign up to inidual sports like running and cycling, but others will be left high and dry. The circle of friends they have built themselves around has been smashed to smithereens by the very association that invited them through their gates at the age of six. There are not many Paddy McBreartys, Benny Coulters or Ryan Bells, who are ready to step into a senior team once they emerge from minor. In chapter  of the GAAs Official Guide, the basic aiminvolves strengthening the National Identity in a  County Ireland through the preservation and promotion of Gaelic Games and pastimes. Section .tells us that the GAA will assist in promoting a community spirit through its clubs. This move to U, U and U, in my view, is elitist. The motion to force it at the  Congress was withdrawn and later that year, the association produced an -page Talent Academy and Player Development Review. One of its recommendations read as follows: “In order to bring synergy between club and inter-county competitions, it is recommended that all counties prioritise competitions at the following age grades: U, U and U levels.” To be fair to the report, it has a lot of well-delivered material in it and joined up thinking is a necessity between school, club and county. In that regard, Ulster Coaching Chief Eugene Young, former Dublin player and selector Jason Sherlock, Galways All-Ireland winning minor hurling manager Jeffrey Lynskey and former St Macartans Monaghan Vice Principal Garrett Coyle is a wide range of knowledge. My concern is that of the over , stakeholders it consulted,  were full-time GAA staff and a further  county board officers – twice as many as the  U players who are those most affected. As I said, the joined up thinking is to be commended and the  iniduals are well-placed to investigate the direction the association needs to go. But, for the new age grades – which is a seismic change to the association – to be forced on clubs, the cohort affected the most, that is wrong. Proper consultation was needed. In my view, keep the age groups as they are. Or better still, follow the  percent of congress who voted for motion  to be passed in February of this year and allow counties to determine its own structure, rather than just follow the party line. This is what Derry needs to do. Leave the age groups alone. Its like the old county minor system, where Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal didnt play championship during the Leaving Cert and the rest of Ulster had to plough on through their A-Levels. From chatting to parents of the Drumloman Gaels minor team who played Lavey last year, they had experience of the U, U and U. They felt it was a hindrance and players didnt get any football. To be fair to Derry CCC, when the adult leagues werent working, they changed them. The club voice has been heard. In Derry, as this column has alluded to in the past, we have a standard of players in our clubs, schools and minor teams that rival anything out there. Conor Glass. Shane McGuigan. Paul Cassidy. Conor McCluskey. Patrick Kearney. The old structures didnt do them any harm, nor will it hinder the generations who will follow them from clubs, through schools and into county teams. Regardless of what Croke Park say, its time clubs did their  U players a favour...ask them what they think of their new grades for next season. They are the people who really matter. Its not asthere is anything  to do inside the closed gates of clubs at the minute. If you dont, youre failing them. And other sports will gladly take those you lose.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He tells Michael McMullan of the decision, the ups, the downs the memories along the way. Four days after this years county hurling final, Liam Hinphey took a moment to post a brief, yet the most poignant of tweets. Fteen words. Four photos. Three jersies. Red, black and white hearts. The colours he soldiered in. The former Dungiven and Derry footballer, was putting away his hurl. “Father time is undefeated,” it began. A career that juggled big and wee ball, across school, college, club and county had run its course.  googletag.cmd.push “You know when the time is right and you have dferent priorities,” he stated early in our interview. His we Clare had given up work to be their son Liams full-time carer. The three year-old lives with Dravet Syndrome, a drug-resistant form of epilepsy that leads to seizures and visits to hospital. “He just needs full time care and we decided Clare was the best person to do it,” Liam adds. Their daughter Cara is now in P. On the Wednesday after the final, her and Daddy went for a walk. “It was a nice evening and it wouldve been one of our training nights. Me and her went for a walk and I thought this is great to get spending a bit of time with her. googletag.cmd.push “If it was mid-season, I wouldve been at training and Clare wouldve had the two weans.” An interview to recollect his playing career, meant hed have to go through with retirement. A warrior on the pitch, every word coming down the phone was calculated and softly spoken. In the epicentre of his dual county career, a successful battle with a groin injury forced him to pick one code. With the time needed to compete, he looked into his soul. It was the wee ball that plucked harder at his emotions. Years later, as the weeks ticked towards the  club season and with a winter of rehabbing another groin injury, he veered towards another sporting crossroads.      His sons seizures had begun. Family called. Mixing both sports wasnt going to be feasible. “I cant play any more,” he reluctantly told the football management. “It wasnt like I didnt want to, I just didnt have time. Work and home le was getting fairly hectic. I wouldve needed to have manufactured another couple of days in the week,” said Hinphey, who played senior championship football for Dungiven since he stepped out of minor until the age of  or . “In that time, I played county hurling and football, I was travelling up and down to Belfast four or five nights a week...it was tight going.”  By the time that years hurling championship came around, he missed the semi-final with Slaughtneil, a game they lost by a point. As the Derry hurling heavyweights were prodding one another in an epic at Ballinascreen, Liam and Clare were in hospital as their son took a bad seizure. “That was the first big game that I couldnt play in,” Liam said.  The nature of the defeat made it dficult to walk away. They were close. But how could he keep up the level of preparation,his sons condition needed more care  “Is it worth it, to put a full year into it,” Liam asked himself. “Championship is what you play for.” He asked again. “Is it worth another nine months of hard work to potentially not play again ” He decided to give it one last big push for the  season and was pleasantly surprised when new Derry manager John McEvoy rang him. Collie McGurk had coaxed him back out to play in the semi-final of the Christy Ring against Kildare the year before and Derry wasnt on the radar under the new boss. “I wasnt expecting John to ask me, but he did. I thought,it is going to be my last year I might as well play for the county .” Derry lost in the Christy Ring semi-final to Meath, again to the eventual winners before embarking on what he still felt was his last season of club action. “My attitude before itwas, just to give this everything. Win or lose, thats me,” Liam said.Shortly after the final, Geoffrey McGonigle asked him to meet him for a pint. Knowing Geoffrey was staying on as manager, Liam knew the gist of what was to follow. “The first words he said was  youre not playing hurling next year, Im gonna bust your face,” Hinphey laughs. “We got chatting and I said wed give it a go and see how it plays out.” His sons cluster of seizures and with Covid bringing a greater risk, Liam didnt lt a hurl until just before the semi-final win over Ballinascreen.  The lack of time to prepare made up his mind. “I know myself that I was far from my best,” he conceded, admitting that his general fitness wasnt the problem. “This year, I was trying to play with very little training behind me. Unfortunately, the way things are, I cant commit the time and effort to stay in the shape I need to be at the level I would want to play at.” Trying to topple Slaughtneil would have to be the target. He compares their professionalism to a county team. “Id love to be selfish enough to do it, to train every day...be it recovery, a gym session, swimming or just training.” Hed love the challenge, but father time didnt agree. It was time to move on. *** Along with his brothers Kieran and Kevin, Liam spent hours of their youth hurling in the garden. All-Irelands from the telly were re-enacted, with the odd flood of tears and the smash of a window pane. Their mother is Mary K Brolly, sister of the late Francie. Their sister Emer began playing camogie again in her thirties, for Bredagh in Belfast, where she won an intermediate title. Like her brother Kevin has with the Lynchs, she has followed father Liam seniors footsteps into coaching. Even though his Da was a big hurling man, Liam doesnt ever remember being forced into the game. “Da went to Croke Park for every Kilkenny game and he used to bring us since we were no height. I mustve been to Croke Park  times before I was  years of age,” he said.  Along with a group of friends, from the age of , they would spend their summers up at the Gaelic pitch, from morning to night. In between, it was just wall to wall football and hurling. His age group didnt win anything as they moved up the ranks, but playing above himself on Kevins team bore fruit. “That was a strong team. The only thing we didnt win was the U Feacuteile final,” remembers Liam, who won one of his U medals as a goalkeeper. Two minor titles followed and after losing to Ballygalget in the Ulster final in Ballinascreen, they went on better the following year to see off St Galls in the decider. “The success we had at senior level was a combination of those boys coming through. We joined in with Barry Kelly, Emmet McKeever, James Donaghy , Geoffrey, Ronie , Eddie Friel...that group. It was a really good combination of youth and experience,” Liam pointed out. It yielded seven senior championships, including one as captain in , with the last coming in . Along with Dungivens football final defeat to Loup in , Liams other disappointment was their Ulster hurling final defeat two years earlier to Dunloy. With time up, they trailed - to -, but a Paul Shiels goal saw the Antrim champions punish the Lynchs with a late - burst at Casement Park. Liam refers to their missed goal chances, but like all the defeats he takes them in his stride – mentioning them without dwelling too much. Niall Mullan handed him his senior championship debut in a  defeat by Slaughtneil in Drum, in the week of his th birthday.  “I was marking Dermot Doherty,” Hinphey recalls. “ I remember the terrible weather, it pished all night.” He had just turned  and remembers taking a drink that night for the first time. “Before that, I just didnt bother. It wasnt anything overly religious. It was the time when boys were sneaking cans, I was more afraid of Ma and Da.” Kevin Lynchs would win six of the next seven championships and, over his career, the  defeat to Banagher was one of a few he felt got away from them. “We had a goal disallowed and a few things. Its not something I sit up worrying about. I am happy enough with my lot. “There was one against Slaughtneil . They scored two goals in the last five minutes. We sort of controlled that game.” The words between Hinpheys recollections are consistent. His career was a good one, blessed with talented teams with craic and friendships along the way. It has been nine years since they won the Fr Collins Cup, but Hinphey didnt see that spell as a slog with any fall outs. “We have had good management and good setups,” he stressed. “The players put it in. They are great lads, you had  to  training every night and putting it in. Its a pity we werent more successful.” There is also the camaraderie. Niall Mullan gave him his debut and he played alongside his son Darragh. He was managed by John A Mullan and played on the same team as his sons John and Richie. “There are zero boys Ive played with, thatyou were sitting in a bar in a few years time, you wouldnt be able to have a few pints with him. It is something to be thankful for. “I am lucky enough from that point of view, to have the characters we had around the place. Thats one of the good things to take away from it.” He doesnt believe in drink bans. Teams who are driven, will find their way to balance the work and the social aspect. In his opinion, you need both. After finals it was about getting back to the town and being in each others company. First it was into McReynolds, before heading down to the Arcade. Liam felt the  final defeat to Slaughtneil was one that got away “In the earlier days wed have ended up in the Carraig Rua. Later on, it was the Tavern or Donegal Charlies,” said Hinphey, who always appreciated the Monday. “You get in early and it is the first chance the team gets to sit and have the craic together. Those days were always the best.” In recent years, without the Fr Collins Cup to show for their efforts, it was still important to unite. “You have put a lot of time into it...hours and hours,. You have to... not celebrate that you are beat, but put an exclamation mark at the end season and have a few drinks with boys to finish it out...otherwise what is the point ” Liams first taste of senior county hurling came in the  season, while still at school. After St Patricks Magheras Hogan Cup run, he didnt feature in Dominic McKinleys Ulster championship plans, but started at wing forward in an All-Ireland preliminary round two-point defeat to Kerry in Tullamore, marking his debut with a point. “I loved my times playing with Derry hurling and ultimately, thats why I didnt go back to thefootball,” Liam admits.Pulling his body between both codes told him to choose. He went for his favourite. “I would rather be playing the hurling and try to push the Derry hurling on a bit. That was the decision I made and I dont regret it one minute. “We had brilliant days, there was not as much silverware as we shouldve won, but there were some brilliant years,” he added. He has two Nicky Rackard Cup medals, but the Christy Ring Cup eluded him. The semi-final defeats of  to Kildare and the following year to Meath, his last game with the county, were as close he got. With both going on to win the final easily. “We got the final onceand it was the year we were further away. That Kerry team was very strong,” he adds. “That was always the ambition of ours. We were always good enough, but we didnt. There is nothing I sitand think we shouldve won.” Like with the club, he points to the Derry men he hurled with, who will be friends for le. “The friendships I have made over the years are more important than that sort of stuff. Big Ruairi , Breandan Quigley and Paddy Henry...all them boys.”  The WhatsApp group is an active one. “They are the friends I have and thats not to be scoffed at either. It is an important thing and I am very thankful for.” *** By his own admission, Liam Hinphey was far from being the best footballer on Dungiven underage teams. At St Patricks Maghera, he didnt play on any of the school teams after second or third year. And there werent any teachers coming knocking on the door to coax him. At the start of Upper Sixth, a requirement to pick an activity for the Wednesday afternoon sport slot and the prompt of a class mate helped him make the first step on the road to a senior inter-county football career. “It was Joe Keenan,” Hinphey begins. “He talked me into going to these Gaelic matches. I went down, started to play well.” After playing a few games for the B team in the ODoherty, Dermot McNicholl liked what he saw. “I started all thegroup games, I played half-back and ended up being moved into midfield. I ended up having to mark the main men on the other teams. I wasnt a great footballer, but I was good at stopping great footballers.” Maghera beat rivals St Marys Magherafelt in the final. In the Hogan Cup semi-final against Colaacuteiste Na Sceilge, he was asked to mark Kerrys Bryan Sheehan and James Kavanagh in the final against St Jarlaths Tuam. “Winning the Hogan Cup was brilliant,” Hinphey said. “It is a dferent build up and dferent sort of camaraderie. You are spending more time with those boys than you are with your own families, because you are at school with them for eight hours a day.” That campaign made him as a footballer and by Wednesday, Dermot McNicholl, who was also Dungivens senior manager, fired him in at centre back against Slaughtneil. That was the beginning. “The thought of playing senior wouldve been fancul”, he said of his ambitions at underage. “In terms of my football development, it wouldnt have played senior football for Dungiven or Derry without that .  Liam in football action for Dungiven  “When I was younger, I was never the paciest. Then I started to mature a bit at  or . I got a lot faster, so from half back I was able to burst forward. Before that, I was jogging about at one pace.” Paddy Crozier took over as Dungiven boss and later called Hinphey up when he became the Derry senior manager at the start of the  season. “I didnt feel out of my depth when I did go up,” he said. After wonderinghe could play at the level, the lure of Division  and pitting himself against some of the best about convinced Hinphey to answer Paddys call. “I started most of that year,” Liam recalls. He spoke of the night Oisin McConville, Stevie McDonnell and Kieran McGeeney back-boned a strong Armagh side at a packed Celtic Park. “I think we had to delay the throw-in, because there was that big a crowd...and we beat them. Days like that gave me huge confidence going forward,” Liam adds. After tailing away, Derry failed to make the league final and lay in wait for All-Ireland champions Tyrone in the championship. Derry had their homework done to a tee. There was a militant month of preparation, said Hinphey. In the build-up Crozier informed him hed be picking up Sean Cavanaghhe played in the half-forward line. The Derry boss even had Mark Lynch mimic Cavanaghs dummy at training in preparation. “It didnt do much good, I fell for the dummy a couple of minutes into the game,” Liam laughs. “But, that gives you confidence from the manager asking you to pick up a role like that. “Tyrone that day, they played into our hands. Mark Lynch went deep and Davy Harte followed him. No harm to anybody, no matteryou are All-Ireland champions or not,you leave big massive gaps in front and you have the two Bradleys playing and Big Enda, you are going to get cleaned out and thats what happened.” Derry held the Red Hands scoreless in the first half and ambushed them, before going out against Donegal in the next round. “We didnt play anywhere near what we could have. I think we put that much into the Tyrone game,” Hinphey feels. “There was a quick turnaround for the Ulster semi-final and we maybe couldnt get up to that same level.” The following season, Derry took Dublin down to the final stretch in a pulsating All-Ireland Quarter Final and in  beat Kerry in the league final. Liam and Clare then took off for an eight-month trip to Australia, where he hurled with Sydney Shamrocks. “I came backand did a Master degree and was living up in Belfast. Damian Cassidy was the Derry manager and I was back playing for Derry. James OKane was taking the hurling and my Da was helping him out, so I was trying to keep my toe in there too,” Liam explains. The groin injury flared up and it was time to decide. He chose the hurling path that took him around many a corner and as far as last month and his decision to call it a day. One hour of chatting later and Hinphey is still content. “Theres a group of us and we have been friends since  years of age and still are,” he said of those he hurled with in the club. “It was great and a childhood well lived. I couldnt have played for so longClare wasnt so selfless and happy for me to put so much into it when she was looking after the children.” Its now father time.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat has remained wedged on mud flats in the local river close to Bay Road park since August . Over eight weeks later, it has become somewhat of a visitor attraction and captured the imagination of the city, with people regularly checking to seeit has finally taken to the seas again. Back in August, the Derry News discovered that the boat, named Day Dawn N , had been purchased for pound from a fisherman who didn’t want to see it decommissioned, according to the Assistant Harbour Master at Portrush. googletag.cmd.push It also came to light that the new owner was considering converting it into an Air B ’n’ B. The saying goes, ‘a high tide lts all boats’, but it appears Day Dawn is not for moving.  Pat Carlin of Foyle Search  Rescue had initially predicted that the vessel would set float again in mid-September with rainfall accounting for a higher tide. Now, in his view, the boat is in such a ‘bad position’ that it will require a larger vessel to dislodge it from the mudflats or floods which nobody wants to see because of the associated risks. Mr Carlin explained that the highest tide in the Foyle this year was about three metres and it never rises much above that. googletag.cmd.push That still wasn’t enough as the vessel is stuck solid on a bank which is visible when the tide is out. “The tide isn’t big enough to lt her,” said Mr Carlin. “We, unfortunately, don’t have the facilities even at high tide to pull her out. “You can see that she’s a trawler, and with the size our own boats, we don’t have any facilities to bring her out. “It’s a very bad position they’re in, it’s in the shallows, the water is not deep enough to float a vessel of that size. “The high tide is not lting her there, she’s stuck.     “You’re going to need a bigger boat to pull her out, I’m sure it’s possiblethe harbour were involved or someone .” As there is no immediate danger to maritime traffic ,it’s not a matter for rescue services. Mr Carlin added: “It doesn’t come under the remit of RNLI, the Coastguard or ourselves because it’s not an emergency. “We’ve done everything we can since the initial call-out to make sure they were safe and observed all the time and we do our checks every time we’re up and down the river to seeanyone is onboard. “I’m sure from a private perspectivethey wanted to employ somebody they might be able to move it but I’m not % sure.” If released from the mudflats other dangers come into play, he said, as she may be holed underneath or damaged which could mean there’s a possibility of sinking. Mr Carlin added: “If she did in the wrong place you’d have a bigger problem then. “It’s up to the captain and those onboard to decide what they want to do now. “If we had a big enough boat I’m absolutely sure we’d make an attempt to do it but we just don’t have a big enough boat. “We’ve had the maximum tide of the year so far, a . metres tide but she’s just not floating in full tide. “Unless they get a massive flood and a very high tide she looks like she’s stuck there. “As high as we’ve gone this year is .m .m and it’s not budged. “And eventhe tide is that high and you go to pull her off, she’s obviously still stuck there somewhere because she’s not moving.” He continued: “I think it has a . metre trawl which is the depth from the waterline down to the bottom of the boat. “You need a maximum of that to refloat her andyou’ve only got a m tide and she’s stuck on a bank then there’s not much manoeuvre for her to refloat. “It’s not looking good for it at the moment being there so long.” A spokesperson for Foyle Port said they are in regular contact with the owner of the boat. “He informs us that he is working on moving the boat when the conditions allow him to do so,” the spokesperson said. “The boat is not derelict nor is it a shipping, navigation or environmental risk and is anchored safely, so the responsibility is on the owner to move the boat when he can.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New housing at Wapping Lane is one offour new regeneration projects which are helping to change the face of the Fountain area of the city. Wapping Lane runs from Abercorn Road up to the Fountain. The Derry News revealed last week that full plans have been submitted to the local council for a new poundm apartment complex between Carlisle Road and the Fountain. If approved, the complex will incorporate  apartments and business space in buildings along Hawkin Street and Fountain Street. googletag.cmd.push Work is already underway to give the Cathedral Youth Club in the heart of The Fountain a facelt, and designs for a new building for the New Gate Arts and Culture Centrein Hawkin Street, which will incorporate a  seater performance space, dance studio, tuition and art rooms, as well as a cafe and rooftop terrace, are nearing completion. In addition to this, plans for a row of new two-bed homes to replace the derelict housing in Wapping Lane are due to be submitted for planning approval by local developer the Martin Group in the coming weeks. Kyle Thompson, Co-ordinator at the North West Cultural Partnership, which is based in The Fountain, said the once rundown area will become an attractive place for people to live and work. googletag.cmd.push I have been liaising with ious statutory agencies and private developers for a number of years, highlighting the need to address vacancy and dereliction in the area. Now that all the properties in Wapping Lane are under the ownership of one developer they can progress to the next stage and we hope the proposed two bedroom homes will attract people into the area to become part of this vibrant community. This area is also steeped in history and is one of oldest inhabited places in the city outside of the City Walls. Hawkin Street actually appears on some of the very first maps of the area.     For many years, the Fountains reputation was synonymous with interface attacks, but Mr Thompson believes the recent work of the North West Cultural Partnership and the New Gate Arts and Culture Centre to celebrate the history of the area has helped restore a sense of pride amongst the residents. There are a lot of misconceptions about The Fountain, but providing people with information about its history and culture and showcasing it in a positive light we can show them that this is a vibrant community that is a very attractive place to live. The Housing Executive houses here are in good condition and there is a waiting list of people wanting to get houses here. The Fountain doesnt have any antisocial activity or crime, it has a great primary school, a youth club and an arts and cultural centre so its a great place for raising a family. It would be great to see some people come back to the area or new people to come and join the community here. There is a small population and in a lot of cases kids grow up and move into the area themselves- they dont go too far. You have your family living around you and it makes the area very safe because everyone knows each other and they look out for each other.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Approval of the proposal, which will see street lighting installed on the footpath along the Tobermore Road, was confirmed at a recent meeting of Mid Ulster District Councils Development Committee. The lighting will run from the Park and Ride bus stop to the mph zone at the edge of the town. Councillor Martin Kearney said the move has been a long time coming. “I was delighted to support the proposal to install street lighting on the existing footpath along the Tobermore Road from the Park and Ride to the  mph zone on the edge of Maghera,” he said. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Martin Kearney. “The cost of lighting up this  metre stretch of footpath will be met from the Department of Finance budget. “The residents of Maghera have waited a long time for this provision and I have campaigned for many years for its consideration. “This will greatly increase the safety after dark of the many pedestrians who wish to avail of the bus services at nearby Craigadick.” The scheme is one of a number of developments currently ongoing in the County Derry town, with work having recently begun on transforming the former PSNI station into a state-of-the-art leisure facility. The completion of the Loop, a walking track taking in the Crewe Road, Station Road and Coleraine Road provides another walking opportunity in the town. googletag.cmd.push A landscaped walkway known as the Larantogher Walkway, which connects to the Walled Garden, has also been recently completed as part of a pound, investment programme. “There is much on offer to enhance the health and well-being of the local community,” added Cllr Kearney. “The completion of the ‘Loop’ from Station Rd, along Crewe Road and back by Coleraine Rd affords many locals an excellent walking opportunity especially in these Covid times. “The health and well-being of the local community have certainly been enhanced by these developments,” added the local councillor.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning a wedding is a major event in anyone’s le but little did the Churchill girl think that her trip down the aisle with her intended, Eric Moore from Letterleague just outside Letterkenny, would first begin in the classroom where she works. These uncertain times have affected everyone in so many ways but you can only imagine Nicole’s shock when she got to work last Monday only to find out that the pupils and staff had a lovely surprise waiting for her. googletag.cmd.push Her wedding was due to take place in St Columbas Church, Churchill, but the new Covid- restrictions which came into force last Wednesday night meant that only six people could attend the event. The couple decided to postpone the big day as a result but Gartan principal Joanne Gildea and fellow teachers, Clare Murray and Chloe Rankin, aided and abetted by Nicole’s mum Pamela, who also works at the school as secretary, and of course the  pupils, prepared an early wedding present. “We are focusing a lot this year on wellbeing, emotional and mental health so the children decided to hold a party for Nicole last Monday morning to cheer her up. We had cake, cocktail sausages, finger food and made a presentation of flowers, choclate and a gt as well as a card signed by all the children in the school. It was quite an emotional occasion but everyone enjoyed it,” said Joanne. googletag.cmd.push As an extra bonus the school gave Nicole Friday off - well who wants to work on their wedding day  In a special message, Joanne summed up the feelings not just of the school community but the entire population in the Churchill and Gartan areas. “We thought it would be a bit harsh asking her to come on on the day she was supposed to be getting married. At Gartan NS we wish Nicole and Eric all the very best as they make new plans for their special day. We know you will be a beautul bride when you say  I do. The dficult decision to cancel will be worth it in the end.”     What a lovely start to the week by all at Gartan NS - a heartwarming and memorable gesture in these challenging times.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tylor Cartin will feature on Tricked-Out Tractors, which has brought together a dream team of petrol heads who have been restoring beloved vintage tractor models, building custom one-of-a-kind monster machines and crafting bespoke rebuilds. The Claudy woman became obsessed with cars as a child after accompanying her father to car shows and rallies and picking up tips as he worked in the garage at the house. A week after finishing school, Tylor surprised the staff at the local Ford garage by turning up to ask for a job, and she says the industry has been very welcoming overall. googletag.cmd.push When they saw a girl, they asked are you sure about this  she said. I told them this is what I wanted to do. That was about eight years ago now. Whenever I went to tech in Nutts Corner, I was, bar the dinner lady, the only girl in the whole tech. Any time I went for my lunch, the dinner lady came in and sat with me. I certainly didnt find it intimidating, but it took the boys a long time to get used to me. They saw a girl and would think, can we curse in front of her  They didnt know what way to take me, but now, people are so accepting of a woman in the trade, which is great. googletag.cmd.push Master mechanic Tylor will be joined in tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers on the show by restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland in County Down and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise. The Claudy woman says the trio work well together on the show. Were all on the same wave. I think its because were all in the same state of mind, were interested in what were working on and what we want the tractors to finish up like, she said. Theres nothing hugely challenging because between the three of us we are able to work things out together. If someone is struggling with one thing, the other two jump in.     Tylor, Darren and Stephen on the show. The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series. All done while taking on the pressures of hard to get parts and dficult deadlines. Viewers will see the team go wild with paint schemes, get hands on with engine upgrades, have fun out and about go karting, and getting inspiration from a custom car show. From an almost -year-old Fordson, to a champion winning pulling tractor and a classic red Porsche, the TOT workshop has been graced with some of the most sought after tractors around. In the first programme, to be aired on Monday evening, Irish tractor pulling champ, Darren Bailey brings in his monster powerhouse machine, The Challenger, so the team can help him get it into shape for the new season. With three All-Ireland Championships under his belt, this time he needs to make sure his tractor is bigger and better to hold onto his title. Tylor describes the scenes viewers will witness on Monday night as being a real learning experience. I liked working on Darrens tractor, it had a lorry engine on it, she said. To have a mix between that and the tractor, that was amazing. It was all custom made and Im really into that. It was just a complete learning curve. Even the tractor pulling sport itself and the standards they have to keep themselves, to keep within the rules thats all stuff nobody knows unless you do the actual taking part. The first episode of Tricked Out Tractors will be on BBC One NI at .pm.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Leon O’Laeartaigh lives at Foxhill in the Waterside. Every day, he goes for a walk along the Strabane Old Road and Woodside Road. He takes a litter picker and some bags with him to collect rubbish as he walks. He sometimes also stops to trim overgrown hedges in the area. They are small gestures, but ones, Leons neighbours say, which are making a big dference in the area. In tribute to the local mans efforts, one of his neighbours, Anaeleigh McCormick, put a post on Facebook about him on Friday and it received a huge response. googletag.cmd.push Anaeleigh described Leon as a great wee man. “Leon worked for many years in Tesco and has been retired a few years,” she said. “He was a daily gym attender until Covid arrived with us. He may well fall into the category of being vulnerable to Covid. “He could have retreated to his home and waited for this storm of le to pass. However that’s not how he is. “Leon decided that it was important that he continue his exercise every day and so took to walking the Strabane Old Road and Woodside Road. “Many would say that golf is a good walk destroyed but Leon noticed the amount of litter that lay on our paths and so ordered his stick for lting litter. He happily spoiled his daily walk and has been lting every day since, some days he tells me that he can get up to three bagfuls. googletag.cmd.push “As the appearance of the area began to improve and the summer months were with us, Leon took to trimming the hedges.“He has become the caretaker of our community.” Anaeleigh said Leon had a simple reason for doing what he does. “When I asked him what he was doing he said I’m lting the area up. “Single handedly, one piece of litter at a time, this is what he is doing. “He said you seeyou improve the area a little bit at a time it lts everyone up and everyone starts to contribute. Everyone starts taking better care of their own gardens and properties.     “He told me that a few young people in their foolishness had spoiled a planted area and that he felt it was better to fix it up again. “He started at it himself and a few neighbours then joined him and they ed it to its former glorynot better. You see it helps everyone he said and the young people seen it was important to everyone.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The grant would be available to people who are unable to work because they have been told to self-isolate due to close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-. SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan, who is the partys Social Justice spokesperson, said he was disappointed with a response from the Department for Communities to an Assembly question calling for aself-isolationsupport grant for Northern Ireland, in line with counterparts in the UK. Mr Durkan said: “We remain the only devolved administration not to offer this crucial grant. googletag.cmd.push By makingself-isolationfinancially unviable we run the risk of putting people in the desperate situation of choosing between protecting others from the risk of Covid- or providing for themselves and their families. Mr Durkan said the Department of Communities had responded to his question with a vague acknowledgement that the grant will remain ‘under review’ and signposting instead to the Discretionary Support Grant. This non-repayable living expense grant, which I have no doubt has helped many throughout the pandemic, has marked limitations. Most notably the eligibility criteria states that a household cannot earn in excess of pound,, locking many families out of critical financial assistance. googletag.cmd.push “People cannot afford dither and delay when it comes toself-isolationsupport, this is something which needs introduced with immediate effect - as has been the case in England, Scotland and Wales. It would now appear the North will lose out on this important scheme. The circuit breaker has placed Northern Ireland under some of the most stringent restrictions on these islands. People who are doing the right thing byself-isolating to prevent the spread of the virus should not have to do so to the detriment of their finances.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two people in the car and the driver of the bus were taken to hospital.Twelve pupils were on board the bus with two treated at the scene by paramedics with a third taken to hospital with non-le threatening injuries. The student was later discharged.Cllr Lewis mdash who attended the scene of the accident ndash said everyonersquos thoughts will be with all those involved.He said the crash took place at a sweeping bend which is often busy during the morning school run and revealed that there have been a number of recent accidents at this particular location.ldquoThis is something that the Department for Infrastructure should take a look at in terms of increasing safety, he continued.Cllr Lewis also praised everyone who assisted at last weekrsquos accident, including those who were first on the scene and members of the emergency services.He reserved special praise for the air ambulance, highlighting its continued commitment and dedication to the community, describing the service as ldquoabsolutely vital at this time of deep uncertainty.Cllr Lewis said he hoped all those injured in the accident will make a speedy recovery while Cllr Hugh Gallagher said the local community had been left in shock following last weekrsquos accident.He said what happened has hit everybody hard because the two teenagers in the car that was involved in the crash ldquoare lovely young guys.He continued: ldquoItrsquos the last thing anybody wanted. That road can be a slippery one at times and there have been a few accidents on it before.Cllr Gallagher also praised the quick response of the emergency services including the air ambulance. He said that once again the service ldquohad come up trumps by taking the most seriously injured teenager to the hospital.ldquoThey really did a fantastic job along with all the other emergency services, he added.Translink has confirmed it is working with the PSNI into finding out the circumstances of the accident.Police, who have issued a fresh appeal for information, are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident or was travelling along the Downpatrick Road at the time and may have captured dashcam footage.They want to hear from anyone who may have seen the car before the collision with the bus and what the road conditions were like at the time.Anyone who can assist is asked to contact officers on the non-emergency  number, quoting reference    ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Camogs.jpg","title":"Camogs lift Ulster Intermediate title  ","story":"A LATE burst of scoring from Down saw them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the Ulster Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Pearse Ogs, Armagh.Armagh had looked set to be crowned champions when they held a - to - lead after  minutes.However the Mourne girls rallied and went on to deservedly claimed a first ever provincial title at this level.Going into the match, Armaghrsquos main threat looked to come from players such as the Donnelly sisters, Rachel Merry and Ciara Hill. But Down had troopers who stood up to the challenge and excelled.Neisha McCullough was superb in thwarting the danger. As well as that, Lauren Clarke and Isabella OrsquoHare worked tirelessly for the cause and kept their opponents occupied throughout.Erin Rafferty and Olivia Boyle also battled stoically for Down and were instrumental in the teamrsquos superiority at the business end of this contest.Manager Derek Dunne was delighted with the overall performance. ldquoWe had a very young side out there, he said.ldquoNo one was over the age of , and to be honest that maybe showed a bit in the first half when we took the wrong option a few times.ldquoIn the second half we created a lot more chances, but it wasnrsquot really until close to the end that we made that count on the scoreboard.Dunne added that the result will do wonders for his team in the long run. ldquoI thought we worked the ball well right throughout that match.

Despite constant promises from the EA and their contractors we are still no closer to getting this issue resolved.ldquoConsidering the number of our parents who will be losing their jobs during this crisis it is unconscionable that those being paid a regular salary are failing to deliver a service.On Friday Education Minister Peter Weir visited The High School in Ballynahinch where he opened a new ICT suite and met with staff and pupils.Mr Weir visited classrooms and spoke with the pupils, asking about how they were operating in bubbles.The board of governors and the principal, Mr Paul Marks, also had a chance for a meeting about the new mid-term arrangements and how this would affect the pupils.Mr Marks said afterwards: ldquoToday was a chance for the Minister of Education to see how schools are operating under Covid and the arrangements we have put in place to allow safe teaching and learning for our pupils.ldquoI am really pleased to have Minister Weir here as I got to show off just what a wonderful school we have and how great our children are. I am really proud of what we have achieved here and hope for even greater things to come.A number of other local principals have commented on the extended Halloween break.Mr Joe McCann, principal of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, said the timing of the closure would appear to be appropriate, given the rising number of Covid- cases throughout Northern Ireland.lsquoWe have been extremely busy to ensure that the school is a safe place for staff and pupils. We have tried to keep the school fully operational and have been working closely with the Public Health Agencyto deal with the cases that have presented, he remarked.ldquoWe would like to thank our parents for their patience and understanding in responding so promptly to communication from the school and PHA during these challenging times.ldquoI want to pay tribute to our students, particularly those taught in bubbles, who have coped admirably with the lsquonew normalrsquo. For our Key Stage  pupils, the break is welcome.Mr McCann continued: ldquoHowever, while the timing is right from a public health perspective, the Ministerrsquos announcement last Friday regarding exam arrangements, specically concerning GCSE Maths and GCSE English, has heightened anxiety among pupils, parents and staff as they work to prepare for an exam in January.ldquoI also want to pay tribute to my staff for their continued effort through what has been the most challenging time in their careers. Their work in creating a safe learning environment has been tremendous.Mrs Maud Perry, principal of Down High School, described the current situation as ldquoconcerning and hoped that the transmission of the virus will reduce as a result of this extended half-term.ldquoMy main hope is that everyone in the school community remains safe, she said. ldquoIt is important that all people in the district do their utmost to comply with regulations and act in a socially responsible way.ldquoThis has been an especially dficult start to the school year and I want to commend my colleagues for the very professional and dedicated way in which they have coped with a wholly dferent school experience.ldquoThere are many uncertainties at present, not least the situation in relation to public examinations. I hope the awarding bodies provide clear and helpful guidance to teachers, pupils and parents as a matter of urgency. The lack of clarity to date has heightened anxiety for young people, parents and teachers.Mrs Perry added: ldquoSchools have worked extremely hard to welcome pupils back to structured face-to-face learning experiences and pupils were thoroughly enjoying their school experience, albeit it very dferent.ldquoI really hope that we canto what we do best after this lsquocircuit breakerrsquo. Children do need to be in school for so many social, emotional and educational reasons and I hope that we canenergised on November .Mr Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, also welcomed the extended Halloween break and said students deserved a ldquomuch-needed rest from the pressures of school le.He continued: ldquoThe mental impact of Covid- on our young people cannot be underestimated at this time and we need to look after them.ldquoNow is the time for students to breathe again and to look after themselves before ing to school on November . We would encourage all our young people to adhere to public health guidelines during this period.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle High School in Downpatrick, said the school had adhered to official guidance to mitigate risk and keep everyone safe.ldquoWhile our pupils welcome and deserve the extended break for Halloween, it canrsquot be said for us as a school and for other schools in the community, who were preparing to continue teaching remotely, he said.Mr Maguire said that from next week, students would be encouraged to log on to continue their studies, ldquoirrespective of the Ministerrsquos advice.He continued: ldquoWe have allocated a large number of IT devices to enable our children to engage and we continue to source these devices to ensure no one misses out.Mr Maguire said thatschools could not reopen, Mr Weir should allow them to teach remotely.ldquoWhile there is nothing like face to face teaching, itrsquos the best option as opposed to a further extension to the break, he continued. ldquoSchools are under immense pressure to deliver content and prepare not only for GCSE GCE exams, but to educate children as a whole in a very tight window.ldquoI would welcome DE CCEA to look at this urgently, the current changes are not near enough. Children are anxious and worried. A bold decision needs to be made in respect to how schools prepared for exams.ldquoIt seems no one is listening to those people on the ground, in the classroom working with children, delivering two year programmes and trying to deal with Covid.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe have a considerable number of pupils sitting GCSE science papers on their . They are not being prepared the way I want them to be prepared, how others previous to them were prepared. They are not getting a fair chance at this exam paper but yet weare told to continue aseverything is normal. Itrsquos not good enough.Mr Stephen Taylor, principal of Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, expressed his concern about the loss of learning for students.However, he believed the welfare of all students and the wider community was the priority and the decision to close schools on the basis of medical advice was correct.ldquoIn Blackwater Integrated College during the past eight weeks much work has been done to ensure staff and students are set up for remote learning through Google Classroom for an eventuality such as this, he said.lsquolsquoWe have made sure all students have access to Google Classroom from home should this period of closure extend beyond the two weeks by lending out iPads to many students and working closely with students to ensure they have access to high quality online learning.He added: rsquorsquoBlackwater has been fortunate as a school that no member of the school community has tested positive since restart and I commend everyone associated with the college for their hard work in ensuring a safe environment for all.rsquorsquoMr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar, said he recognised Covid- had greatly impacted on the entire school community.ldquoWe are determined to help all our pupils bridge the educational gap they have suffered since closing in March, whilst also supporting their emotional and social needs, he said.ldquoWe understand the frustration of families with schools closing but this decision is an attempt to keep all members of our school safe and avoid longer closures.ldquoOur Year  pupils are due to sit exams in the November series however, we have had no update from the Minister of Education on contingency plans. I am genuinely concerned as to what will happenwe do notin November ora pupil, or whole class, have to self-isolate.ldquoI am also frustrated at the Ministerrsquos response regarding the summer exams. The expectation to sit full GCSE courses in a number of subjects, including Maths, having missed face to face teaching for four months, places further pressure on pupils.ldquoOur pupils are important to all of us as iniduals, we know their hopes and aspirations and aim to help them achieve these. They are not simply another number or statistic.Mr Hanna continued: ldquoAs principal, I feel we are fighting not only the virus, but the decisions from the Minister of Education who, rather than supporting, is pushing against us. The gates of St Colmcillersquos may be closed for a while. However, we will continue to support all our pupils through online resources.ldquoWe have ensured all pupils have access to Google Classroom and online Maths programmes whilst providing tutorial videos to help our parents understand how pupils access these.He added: ldquoSt Colmcillersquos High School will continue to support all our pupils, parents and staff during and after this closure, working together to prioritise our pupils.Shimna Integrated College principal, Mr Kevin Lambe, said the school would be treating the two-week closure as a holiday.ldquoWe know our staff and students, especially Years  and  who have been back since August , are more than ready for a real rest, he said.ldquoOur support staff and premises staff have been back for even longer and teachers were working away preparing for this very strange year. The two weeks are holiday and schools will not be delivering remote learning.ldquoHowever, staff have shared with students ideas for good things to do during the circuit breaker and have provided guidance to help our examination year students to take the initiative and make good use of their time.

Province-wide, a total of  dogs were euthanised last year, with Ards and North Down Council the only local authority not to destroy any animals.Councils do not have powers to seize dogs from homes or euthanise legally dangerous animals without a court order, while people whose dog strays and is seized by a council dog warden could receive a warning or fixed penalty fine.Last week, local politicians supported a proposal to examine why the number of dogs the council destroys is so high, with the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreeing that officials consult with both animal charities and local police.Councillors say they are keen for the PSNI to crack down on puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown said there should be ldquoextreme concern that substantially more dogs are put down in the local council area and is pleased that the local authority is to work with others to reduce the number of dogs it destroys after backing a motion he tabled on the issue.It urged council officials to consider ways they can bring together strategic partners such as dog wardens, local kennels, animal welfare officers, police and animal rescue charities to address the issue, including through tackling the illegal and unethical breeding and sale of dogs, particularly online.Cllr Brown described the number of dogs the local authority destroys as ldquoparticularly worrying considering the recent increase in dog theft and illegal puppy farms.He said while there are always situations where a dog may need to be put down due to ill health, efforts should be taken to keep the number of animals euthanised as low as possible.ldquoEven many old or aggressive dogs who are often put down can lead fulfilling lives under the right circumstances, usually with the help of specialist animal charities, continued Cllr Brown.ldquoUnfortunately, Newry, Mourne and Down Council sends less than five percent of its dogs to animal charities while in most other areas itrsquos between  and %. In addition, the local authority sells % of them to the public while in other areas itrsquos around %.Commending local dog kennels for finding homes for so many dogs, Cllr Brown believes that by working more closely with animal charities, the council could reduce the number of unwanted dogs and subsequently the number that are put down.ldquoI am pleased that the council can begin to work strategically to find a forever home for every dog possible, regardless of age or disposition, and am pleased that officials will consult with animal charities on how the number of dogs euthanised can be reduced, he said, also welcoming a commitment to work with police to halt puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Cllr Brown said he was also concerned that many other local councils in Northern Ireland had not claried why figures for the number of dogs they destroy are so low.He added: ldquoI am worried there is a lack of transparency in how some councils report their numbers as many did not write back to Newry, Mourne and Down Council when asked for clarity on how they manage unwanted dogs. Whilst this doesnrsquot excuse our districtrsquos overly high figures, it does bring into question why other areas are so low.ldquoI would like to see all un-homed dogs who are healthy enough not to be put down found a home, eventhat is with a specialist charity which can deal with dangerous or aggressive animals. I hope to see progress and a reduction in the number of dogs euthanised in our area in the months ahead and I look forward to working with the council to achieve this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down hurlers’ victory over Derry secures promotion  ","story":"FOR several years, Down have made it to the door of NHL Division A, only to miss out on entry at the final stage.However on Sunday, they finally gained promotion courtesy of victory over Derry at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh.Down boss Ronan Sheehan and his charges have come so close in recent times, without taking that final step.On Sunday, all that was forgotten, as they got their hands on the cup and the ticket to the higher stage.ldquoTo finally get over the line means everything, Sheehan beamed afterwards. ldquoWe made a big decision this weekend in the U-s when we didnrsquot play Phelim Savage and Ronan Costello.ldquoThat was probably what proved to be the dference today.

engulfed the stairway, preventing her escape.Mr Crossett, who was the duty officer for the area last weekend, raced to the scene of the blaze ahead of local fire crews and as he did so, a fire officer based in Lisburn talked to the woman on the telephone in a bid to keep her calm and assure her help was on the way.He said: ldquoI managed to alert some neighbours and one of them was able to get me a

lethal banger, believed to have been imported from Germany.The device was placed inside the box by three teenagers who were spotted running away and when the banger exploded, large chunks of metal and

greater need than Downpatrick for a bypass.They are still seething at Down Councilrsquos decision to push for by-passes for both towns, a move they believe is tantamount to disaster and will almost certainly result in both schemes never being constructed.However, the publication of the new planning paper has given them renewed hope because it makes it quiet clear that while a by-pass is not the

numerous objections to the goalposts.Mr Alexander said he had been contacted by three families who felt the posts were too close to houses lining the field.Calling for an immediate consultation regarding the play area, he said the older children were now attracted to the kick about area and this was also bothering residents.However, Mr Patsy Toman said the family who lived closest to the

It is essential that everyone does their bit so that we can open for business in December and over Christmas, he said.ldquoIf we do not get that business then it will be carnage in January and many establishments will not survive.

It was confirmed at the time that permission was quashed as the result of a procedural error in relation to the papers before the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with Lidl consistently arguing that its current base is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.The store argues the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Planners have confirmed that they have received a number of objections about the proposed new development with those concerned arguing that the proposal is not in keeping with the residential nature of the area.In addition, they claim that the closure of the existing Lidl store will have a detrimental impact on Newcastle town centre and surrounding inconvenience stores.Concern has also been expressed about the proposed storersquos impact on traffic, the potential for increased flooding and the impact of selling alcohol, particularly to young children, with objectors also arguing that Lidlrsquos proposal is contrary to planning policy, is not in the interests of the community and will impact on the residential amenity of Shanslieve Driveresidents.Recommending that the new supermarket should be granted outline approval, planners say its their opinion that the proposal is acceptable, having assessed it against planning policy and taking into account the input of consultees.Conditions attached to the outline approval recommendation include the net retail floorspace of the new store shall not exceed , square metres and that no goods or merchandise will be stationed or displayed in the forecourt.Opening hours are limited to am to pm from Monday to Saturday and from pm to pm on Sundays.Store deliveries are not permitted between pm and am with onsite floodlighting only operational between these hours.Planners are insisting thatoutline approval is granted at todayrsquos meeting, no development activity or demolition work, ground preparation or vegetation clearance can take place until a final construction and environmental management plan has been submitted and approved by the Planning Authority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Newcastle.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions street collection raises £500 for diabetes charity  ","story":"A COLLECTION organised by Newcastle Lions Club on Saturday raised almost pound for charity.Newcastle Lions would like to thank everyone who donated and stress that all the money will be going to a designated charity.Newcastle Lions, and other Lions clubs throughout Ireland, have been targeting the problem of diabetes this year.World Diabetes Day takes place on November  and last Tuesday Dr Kieran Walshe spoke of his personal journey with type  diabetes.He said that it had taken  years since insulin was first discovered for it to be delivered safely.Today, due to advances in bio technology, patients are controlling their blood glucose using a glucose sensor and a Bluetooth-enabled insulin pump from an algorithm on their mobile phones.Although this is a good news story much more needs to be done as the incidence of diabetes is increasing in both the developed and underdeveloped world.

Instead, the committee asked the government department to carry out restocking which it has thus far failed to do.Cllr Curran believes that a restocked river, in tandem with enhanced angling facilities, would attract local, national and international anglers.He says the river is a key tourism asset but has not had signicant amounts of money invested in it over recent years, suggesting that the waterway has the potential to become of the key jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown.ldquoThe Quoile offers so much potential and there is much scope to invest in this fantastic facility, Cllr Curran continued.He added: ldquoAngling is very much part of the tourism offering in South Down. It is an important recreational sport and the Downpatrick river could be transformed with more investment and restocking.It is not beyond the realms of possibility that at some point in the future it could host a major angling competition.

I was a little bit more patient in the game with Carrick.ldquoWhen Nav [Navid Nasseri] cut down from the left for my third goal, I would usually have been busting to get into the six yard box, but instead I hung back and when the ball came in, I tried to direct away the goalkeeper as much as I could.ldquoThe first two goals were really well-worked. Kirk Millar and Conor Pepper combined well down the right for both. Conor played the ball exactly where it needed to be for my second.Waterworth said with football having been missing from local fansrsquo for so long, the Blues were keen to put on a show last weekend.ldquoThe fans havenrsquot seen any action at Windsor for a long time, so we wanted to perform well here. Irsquom playing in a really good team and getting plenty of chances.There are four of us playing for that number nine position. I probably could have scored more because some good deliveries came in.ldquoWith a little bit more conviction I could have come out with a few more. Irsquoll not be too hard on myself but.The early signs for this season once more bode ominously for the Blues rivals in the battle to land the Gibson Cup once more. However Waterworth thinks they can get even better.ldquoWe are good when we keep the ball and play through teams. Carrick are a tough team to play against, but we gave them the chance to grow into the game.ldquoWe worked hard to establish the early lead and I donrsquot know whether some of us took the foot off the gas a bit after that.It is something we must recty going forward but. We canrsquot afford to do that, because teams will hurt us.ldquoThere is no question we became complacent once we went two up. We were not picking up second balls, and they began to hurt us so that is a lesson.The Bluesrsquo Killyleagh-born manager, David Healy, paid tribute to evergreen Waterworth after his match-winning feat.ldquoAndy does that. He pops up in the right areas, and again Andyrsquos goal ratio over the last three, four, five years since I have been here has been just incredible.ldquoI think actually in that time, his all-round game has improved in the last  months to two years.Hopefully we can keep adding goals to Andyrsquos tally here.Waterworth will hope to keep his great start to the season going when the champions go to former boss David Jeffreyrsquos Ballymena United in the Danske Bank Premiership this Saturday.The former Northern Ireland U- international, who previously had spells at Ards, Lisburn Distillery, Hamilton Academicals and Glentoran, first came to prominence during a successful spell in the Amateur League with Kilmore Rec.The striker scored the opening two goals on Saturday after he got on the end of crosses supplied by Conor Pepper.A Caolan Loughran penalty for Rangers reduced the gap to - at half-time.

We got used to having the schools off and our children home for months on end. We got used to standing in socially-distancing queues when we went to the shops that were open. We got used to having to work from home. We got used to not seeing friends and family on a regular basis. We got used to not being able to go to clubs, restaurants, bars, cinemas.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"People and businesses have got used to putting normal routines on holdAnd all of this required enormous personal sacrice from every one of us. For the elderly and those who lived alone it meant huge pressure on their mental health. For those who needed hospital provision for other ailments and treatments it meant cancelled or postponed appointments and operations. For those who did get into hospitals it meant not being able to be visited by their families. For business owners it was the worry of whether they would survive. For employees it was whether they would still have jobs. For parents it was about their children’s education . Just about every other aspect of my le I can think of has changed over the last seven months: as it has for everyone . When the restrictions began I discussed them with my partner, Kerri and we agreed that caution should be our watchword. We didn’t know more than anyone  about the virusand decided to follow official advice – however dficult it might make our everyday lives. If nothing , the official advice seemed more reliable than the views of thosewho claimed the whole thing was: a a scamdemic b a satanic plotto introduce a world government c a capitalist plot to do away with the need for employees d a plot by governments to deny liberties and keep citizens under new controls e a plot to help pharmaceutical companiesand home delivery companies to grow their empires and f a plot by China to take over the world. I’m sure most of you have read about other plotsand could add to that list.To be fair, I do have some sympathy with those who argue that people are easily duped into doing things. Look at how many people respond to outlandish emails from African royalty offering them a share of millions of dollarsthey’re willing to provide them with their account details. Look at the millions of people who retweet and ‘like’ obviously fake news stories. Look at the millions who are scammed out of huge sums of money in the modern-day equivalents of the s South Sea Bubble. And let’s not forget the hundreds of thousands of Americans who started packing and fleeing their homes on October ,  when New York’s WABCbroadcast Orson Welles’s Martian invasion hoax.It is amazing what people will believe. And always has been. What is not so easy to explain is why so many people now seem prepared to believe that this particular virus is actually a cover for something . Yet they don’t have a convincing explanation for what, in the UK’s case, for example, is to be gained – let alone who will be the beneficiaries – by closing down the economy for months on end and leaving most of the population in a state of constant worry. Or, putting that another way: , as some people believe, our liberties are being curbed and state authorities are being granted ‘sweeping and dangerous’ powers to tackle a virus that doesn’t – so the sceptics claim – present much a threat in the first case, then what is the government up to Anyway, back to where I started. What is meant by ‘learning to live with the virus’  I made the point a few months ago that a sense of fatalism would become a key factor as increasing numbers of people became aware of more and more friends, neighbours, family members and work colleagues contracting Covid. I described it as the ‘personal intimacy with the virus moment’: that moment when most of us reckoned that, irrespective of what we did personally, or as a society, the chances of us, or those close to us, contracting it would become very high. That’s the moment when shoulders are shrugged and people think, ‘what’s the point of the restrictionswe’re likely to get it anyway ’I think that’s what is meant by ‘learning to live with it’ and I think that’s precisely what our leaders should acknowledge at this point. Yet we’re still being drip-fed on a diet of mixed-messaging and contradictory advice. As I say, we’ve already been living with it since March and I’m pretty sure most of us will be content to live with a mix of government expert honesty, commonsense and our own innate sense of survival until such times as a vaccine arrives. In the great scheme of things what we’ve put up with since March has been a massive inconvenience rather than a catastrophe. Not fun by any means but nor is it the end of the world, nor the end of our freedoms. As I keep telling my children: this too shall pass.Now we’re told to learn to live with it.

We took a delivery of about £, worth of food for the boat. There are lots of very kind people, especially in the Annalong and Portaferry area.”Having crossed the Irish Sea, Jordan is making his way up the east coast until he gets close to Ballycastle then he will cross to Scotland.He said: “I’m knackered, but also frustrated because of the weather.

Half the time you didn’t even realise the cameras were there, we forgot ourselves half the time.“I’m like a sponge, I just love picking up all this new stuff. It’s amazing the stuff I learnt over the whole show.“I liked working on Darren’s tractor, it had a lorry engine on it. So to have a mix between that and the tractor, that was amazing and it was all custom made and I’m really into that. “Even the tractor pulling sport itself, there’s stuff nobody knows unless you do the actual taking part. It was really interesting.”She added: “My history is with cars, but any engine – I would just throw myself at it, I would never turn away a challenge. The common principles of engines are all the same, you can’t go too far wrong there.“My daddy was always big into his cars and lorries, I was reared in the shed beside him, picking up the tips and curse words.”Tylor’s father Micky is a lorry driver who does all his own mechanical work.She said: “Whenever I said about being a mechanic, my daddy said, ‘your back will be broke and your head will be fried’. He wasn’t trying to put me off, he was just speaking from experience. “I absolutely love it. Yes, it’s a very male dominated profession, but I have had no hassle in any way because I’m female, or anybody giving my grief about it. Everybody has been so encouraging.”Tylor said she was used to being in male company: “Whenever I went to tech in Nutt’s Corner, I was, bar the dinner lady, the only girl in the whole tech. Anytime I went for my lunch, the dinner lady came in and sat with me. “I certainly didn’t find it intimidating, but it took the boys a long time to get used to me. They saw a girl, and would think, ‘can we curse in front of her ’“They didn’t know what way to take me. However now, people are so accepting of a woman in the trade, which is great.”Tylor’s boyfriend Jamie is a contractor who works with heavy machinery.She said: “He’s machinery mad, the bigger the better. We’ve a wild lot in common. I tell him he’s lucky because most girls wouldn’t want to go with him to sht a digger.”Read More Read MoreNew artwork encourages people to explore Belfast’s ancient entriesSeries producer Zoe McGivern from Green Inc said: “We were looking at the rural world and saw that this was a really big thing, people were putting a lot of money into their tractors, restoring old tractors or blinging out new tractors. It’s not the case that tractors are only for farmers, we’ve seen a wide range or people who own tractors.She continued: “In terms of the casting we set out contacting a lot of the trade magazines, getting tips on who to speak to.“We went out and met a few people. Our guys stood out. They all knew their stuff really well, they had big personalities, I knew they’d get on like a house on fire. They were an absolute pleasure to work with.“Tylor is a master mechanic, she knows her stuff inside out, Stephen has got so much experience with the vintage stuff, restoring classic tractors, Darren is our machinery specialist, he is the man with all the contacts, he’ll find any part you need. They make the perfect team.”Of the three-part series she said: “While there’s tractors at the heart, it’s also a makeover series – the type of thing that anyone can enjoy.”The series, filmed mainly before current Covid- restrictions, begins on BBC One Northern Ireland tonight at .pm.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

AP Photo INA, POOL, fileA new BBC documentary retells the story of a group of labourers from Northern Ireland who found themselves stranded in Iraq after they went there to fit out Saddam Hussein’s palace.When the painters and decorators were in Baghdad in  the Iraqi leader invaded Kuwait, and with war on the horizon, they found themselves at centre of international hostage crisis.One of those men was Bobby Buchanan from Armagh, who left his we and two young children at home to go to Iraq for what looked to be a lucrative job.In the hour-long documentary which airs on Monday night at .pm on BBC One NI Bobby said a lot of the decorators working on the Mivan project in Baghdad were familiar with each other: “We’d all worked together before. “We’re a mixture of Protestants and Catholics, all working class, I’d worked with them for years, all good lads.”Peter McNally from Portadown was excited about the job in Saddam’s palace. He said: “I’d loved going away to work, dferent jobs, dferent people, dferent towns.“When we started working for Deluxe decorators it was just all local work and then they got in with Mivan and we started doing jobs in England and Germany and into Europe and then into America. The money was better when you were going away.“We were approached to go to Iraq, I says ‘I’ll go to the moon’.”Michael Sands who was an engineer with construction and fit out company Mivan said: “I’d absolutely no concern at all coming from Northern Ireland. We’d all lived through the Troubles. I was  in  so I was well used to the Troubles and a militarised country. It didn’t have a bearing on my decision to go.”Bernard McKeever’s we Sharon was a bit more apprehensive: “From the very start I didn’t want him to go. I knew there was something going on to do with oil. He said I was reading too much into it.“It just happened to be the night that I recorded the news that was when it came out to say [Saddam] had signed a peace thing with Kuwait, they weren’t going to invade the country over oil. [Bernard] says, ‘you see, everything’s fine’.Bernard himself recalled: “I thought, ‘it’s going to be good money, it will set us up and hopefully everything will go from there’.”When they arrived in Iraq, where they were put up in a luxury hotel, the men observed that the people were enjoying being out on the streets after the end of the war with Iran.Bernard said: “Everywhere you went at every junction or every roundabout there was a mosaic of Saddam Hussein so he must have been a popular guy. In the later days we learnt from dferent people just how afraid they were of him.”Fellow decorator Michael O’Neill, one of the youngest of the crew, said: “He controlled the radio, he controlled the TV, as the man said to us, ‘the walls have ears’.”The team of labourers from NI were tasked with fitting out Saddam’s palace in Baghdad, a job which required bulletproof windows made in the Harland and Wolff shipyard as well as ornate marbles and granites.Peter admitted to using a common decorators’ trick of hiding their signature under layers of paint: “My name is all over the palace behind the walls, it’s probably still there.”When they weren’t working the men were able to let their hair down in the Mivan social club. Some footage of their social gatherings feature in the documentary made by Tern Television.Sharon said: “They were totally oblivious to what was going on. There was nothing on the news there. I was getting the BBC world news at home.”Back in Northern Ireland those tuning into the news learnt that Iraq had invaded Kuwait and warned foreign powers not to intervene.Bobby said: “The news we were getting, we thought it was more of a skirmish rather than a real invasion.”The local newspaper reported that Kuwait had asked for Iraqi military aid and Baghdad had responded positively. Michael commented: “[Saddam] invaded but he didn’t tell his people that. His own people were oblivious to that because they weren’t getting any outside news. You’d no internet in them days don’t forget.”He added: “On the high rise buildings there were anti-aircraft guns, there was a barracks beside the palace, you’d have seen the recruits training. It was not an army, it was just people conscripted, all shapes and sizes – big, small, fat, skinny, it was so hilarious. Some had boots, some had trainers, some had nothing on their feet. These people weren’t ready to fight a war.”Foreigners in Iraq were told they wouldn’t be able to travel until things were resolved. At the time it was reported , Britons were stranded in Iraq, virtual hostage to Saddam Hussein.Grenville Redmond, former director of Mivan, said: “Saddam would have referred to us as his special guests.” Painter Paul McCabe said: “It didn’t matter who you were, you weren’t allowed to go anywhere. We had to move out of the hotel and move into staff houses that were owned by Mivan and dferent countries. Nobody really knew for sure what was happening.”The decorators stopped being paid but when they refused to work they were told they wouldn’t be given VISAs to go home.It also became more dficult to get in contact with loved ones back home.“You just had to keep trying and trying,” said Bernard. “It maybe took a few days.”Sharon: “It went down from having a telephone call every second day to nothing. Looking back on it now it was terrible, having that dread every day, and maybe not even sleeping for a few days.”Bobby said: “Money was getting tight at home. I was playing for Armagh City at the time, they actually organised a charity thing and they used to send money home to my we. They used to give her £ a week which was fantastic. It was much appreciated.”With Allies sending troops to the Persian Gulf, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein warned of deadly consequences of western intervention.Michael explained how the men stayed up to date with what was happening: “We used to smuggle our radio into the palace and we’d listen to the home service. “It was what was coming fromthat we were worried about. The coalition coming in and invading Iraq, or bombing, or whatever, because we were near the complexes that would have been hit.” Paul said: “My main worry is they would start something before we got out. If the war started when we were still there we were going to be in danger.”A plan had been drawn upwar should break out they’d make for the border in cars.Peter commented: “Some fellas where more scared than others, the only time that it got a wee bit [scary] was whenever I seen the tracer shells lighting up the sky practising for the planes coming in.“I remember one night when the storm started, there were about four or five dferent thunderstorms, we woke up and thought they’d started bombing.”Sharon, who was back home in NI, said: “Every day you were waiting on a call saying they’d been taken , thinking they were never coming back.”In October  Saddam agreed to release all Irish citizens over . John McCausland, a carpenter from Co Antrim was one of them.Paul said: “When John got out that gave us a little bit of hope.”The documentary unearths some touching moments that made the news back home.Footage is shown of Peter receiving a th birthday card and Bobby getting a painting from his daughter Carrie after missing her first day at school.Though the most signicant footage is of PM Margaret Thatcher’s resignation in November .Some of those stranded in Iraq felt she’d been too hostile to Saddam and hadn’t helped their case.Shortly after John Major took charge Saddam announced the hostages could go home.Bobby recalled the moment he was reunited with his family at Aldergrove airport: “I was so glad to be back. “It did change my thinking on le. I was definitely more of a mellow person. Nothing annoyed me much. “The we would probably say I’m back to myself now.”Bernard said: “The innocents always suffer. It’s just something that links us all together for the rest of your le.“Iraq will always be in my heart.”Peter said: “It makes you appreciate what you’ve got.”  \"       \"  Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"health board may meet more frequently due coronavirus ","story":"Youth Service teams ‘out on the ground’ after spike in anti-social behaviour   MP dismisses critics of abstention on vote for free school mealsNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsHealth board may meet more frequently due to coronavirusThe Board of the Southern Health and Social Care Trust may have to consider meeting more frequently to discuss the pressures being placed on the organisation by the coronavirus pandemic, its chair has confirmed.By Adam MortonThursday, nd October , : pmUpdated Thursday, nd October , : pm  \"       \"  Addressing a virtual meeting of the Trust’s Board, Roberta Brownleedescribed dealing with both the normal running of the Trust and the extra pressures as a result of the pandemic as a “challenge”.“COVID- has taken over our lives,” said Mrs Brownlee.“While we continue to do the day-to-day work a lot of time is being taken up with the pandemic but at the same time we are still trying to run our day to day business and that is a challenge.\"“We may have to consider how often we meet.
