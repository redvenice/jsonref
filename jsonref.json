Theresa May (left) has a breakfast meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) at the EU-League of Arab States Summit in  Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Amid a bitter standoff the PM has admitted a final vote on her Brexit plan could be delayed until just 17 days before the EU exit dateThe issue of postponing Brexit came up \u0027fleetingly\u0027 during the discussions between Mrs May and Mrs Merkel this morning, according to Downing Street. But a spokesman said the PM simply repeated that she wanted the UK to leave with a deal on March 29. Speaking at a press conference to close the summit, Mr Tusk said: \u0027Prime Minister May and I discussed yesterday a lot of issues including the legal and procedural context of a potential extension. \u0027For me it is absolutely clear that (if) there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal, we will face an alternative - chaotic Brexit or extension. \u0027The less time there is until March 29, the greater the likelihood of an extension. \u0027This is an objective fact, not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact. Cue ridicule! Theresa May challenged to a game of pool by...Prime Minister is rocked by rift on Britain\u0027s borders as...Share this article    Mrs May said she was making progress in talks but not enough to hold a second \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 this week          Dutch PM Mark Rutte (pictured left with Mrs May today) delivered a stark warning that the UK is \u0027sleepwalking\u0027 into a no-deal Brexit, urging hardline MPs to \u0027wake up\u0027 and approve an agreement          Defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested Mrs May could announced a Brexit delay herself, saying: \u0027The Prime Minister is listening and is recognising the fact that we have tried very, very hard in order to secure a deal.\u0027Speculation that Brexit could be delayed to allow Theresa May to strike a deal with Brussels is sweeping through Westminster.Various plans are afoot that would allow Britain\u0027s departure to be postponed past 11pm on March 29, the real question is how long is the extension.The longer the grace period, the angrier hardline Brexiteers in Theresa May\u0027s Cabinet and on the Conservative backbenchers are likely to be.Here are some of the options:Short and sweetVarious groups are advocating a delay of around two months. An amendment tabled by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Oliver Letwin - to be put to a vote on Wednesday - would force Mrs May to seek an extension if a deal has not been approved by MPs by March 13.Ms Cooper, a former Labour minister, said on Monday it would allow Parliament to tell the Prime Minister to seek an extension to the negotiation process but leave it in the Government\u0027s hands to decide how long it should be.Mrs May could seek to take matters into her own hands as early as tomorrow when she makes a Commons statement.This could theoretically see off a rebellion by Remain-supporting MPs and ministers who are threatening to back Cooper-Letwin.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested there was a possibility of Mrs May herself announcing an extension of the two-year Article 50 negotiation process beyond March 29.Mr Ellwood told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \u0027The Prime Minister is listening and is recognising the fact that we have tried very, very hard in order to secure a deal.\u0027Go long The EU is said to favour a longer delay, possibly up to 21 months.Plans being considered in Brussels would see the transition period due to follow on if the UK leaves with a deal replaced by staying in the EU proper, the Guardian reported. This would allow for deeper talks on the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the aim of making the Irish border backstop - the main sticking point in the drawn-out negotiations - redundant.The possibility of extending Article 50 was raised when May met with German chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday in Egypt. Nuclear optionBritain could unilaterally reverse Article 50 and stay in the EU until the deal is done. A European court ruled last year that this can be done by the UK without seeking consent from other EU states, whereas extending the Article 50 period would require agreement from the other 27 capitals. But it would also be likely to see Brexiteers in Mrs May\u0027s party explode with rage and could speed up her demise.                            Mrs May met European Union Council President Donald Tusk, right, on the sidelines of the summit yesterday          Prime Minister Theresa May is hugged by the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko BorissovBut she refused to criticise the rebel trio and ducked questions about whether the fragile state of her Government made the ministers \u0027unsackable\u0027.Mrs May said: \u0027Collective responsibility has not broken down. What we\u0027ve seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe. That\u0027s not a surprise to anybody.\u0027We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire to actually ensure we leave the EU with a deal. That\u0027s what we\u0027re working for, that\u0027s what I\u0027m working for.\u0027We\u0027ve been having positive talks with the EU. As you know we were in Brussels last week, my team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be returning to Brussels this Tuesday.    If the backbench motion is passed, Mrs May would have until March 13 to get her plan through Parliament or be forced to seek a delay in the process          Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels\u0027As a result of that we won\u0027t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that happens by March 12. It is still within our grasp to leave the EU with a deal on March 29. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re working to do.\u0027Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith last night said that by delaying the meaningful vote, Mrs May was effectively \u0027calling the bluff\u0027 of the Cabinet rebels.\u0027They are smashing the whole concept of government,\u0027 he said.          Margaret Hodge, pictured, said deputy leader Tom Watson\u0027s demand that Labour eradicate anti-Semitism was a \u0027final wake-up call\u0027Three more Labour MPs are threatening to quit the party over anti-Semitism and Brexit.The trio are considering joining the new Independent Group and one said last night: \u0027We\u0027ll see what happens this week.\u0027Margaret Hodge, pictured, said deputy leader Tom Watson\u0027s demand that Labour eradicate anti-Semitism was a \u0027final wake-up call\u0027. Another Labour MP, Louise Ellman, is on the brink of leaving after more than 50 years.A friend said: \u0027Louise will not be in the party for much longer.\u0027The third MP, Siobhain McDonagh, said on Friday she had decided not to resign \u0027this week\u0027 – meaning a decision to go could come soon.Dame Margaret, a former minister who has faced months of abuse from hard-Left activists, said: \u0027This is the final wake-up call for Jeremy Corbyn. The leadership has so lost trust but I don\u0027t believe any of the figures they come out with on the cases they\u0027ve dealt with. I\u0027ve had pretty horrific abuse on Twitter. It absolutely doesn\u0027t feel to me like there is zero tolerance on anti-Semitism.\u0027 Dame Louise said: \u0027I am still fighting with the party\u0027s failure to deal with anti-Semitism.\u0027An unpublished Labour Party report into Dame Louise\u0027s Liverpool Riverside constituency found she was physically threatened by one member and \u0027there have been CLP meetings during which anti-Semitic incidents are alleged to have taken place\u0027.The report said: \u0027These have arisen as a result of \u0027obsessive interrogations\u0027 of the MP over the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some members have felt that others are holding the MP – a Jewish woman – personally accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.\u0027The 11 members of the Independent Group will meet today to discuss organisation, including how to elect a leader. Yesterday Chuka Umunna called on voters to \u0027join us, and help us forge a new, different kind of politics\u0027.A poll for The Observer puts the group\u0027s support at 6 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems. It has also emerged that Sir David Garrard, once one of Labour\u0027s biggest donors, is supporting the new group.                         Tom Watson said Mr Corbyn had to \u0027change very, very rapidly\u0027 to stop more MPs from following the nine who quit the party last week.He also revealed he had handed the party leader a dossier of 50 cases where no adequate action had been taken over racist comments on social media about Jewish iniduals.In a TV interview, he demanded Mr Corbyn take personal charge of rooting out anti-Semitism because the \u0027party machine\u0027 had failed. And he urged him to change tack on Brexit and push for a second referendum.\u0027The departure of our colleagues is a real blow, and we need to understand why they felt the need to go. Because if we\u0027re going to be in government we need to address those concerns.\u0027For us to hold this party together, things have to change. There\u0027s almost a crisis for the soul of the Labour Party now. I absolutely fear that we will lose more parliamentary colleagues. We may lose peers from the House of Lords, and we may lose members and councillors and I don\u0027t want that to happen.\u0027Mr Watson said Luciana Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP who left for the Independent Group last week, had been \u0027bullied out of the Labour Party by a small number of racist thugs\u0027 and he was \u0027very very sad to see her go\u0027.Hard-Left activists, he said, were causing irreparable harm by \u0027pouncing\u0027 on MPs, and bullying them on social media. Details of the anti-Semitism dossier, seen by the Mail, show it included vicious racist abuse. One said of Jewish Labour MPs: \u0027I don\u0027t know what runs through their veins, not human blood.\u0027Mr Watson said Labour general secretary Jenny Formby\u0027s attempts to combat anti-Semitism had \u0027very patently not been adequate\u0027 and Mr Corbyn should take a personal lead.On Brexit, he said Mr Corbyn needed to \u0027reunify our party\u0027 and move towards a second referendum.He also called for more centrist Labour MPs to be given jobs on the front bench and said he was going to set up a new \u0027social democratic\u0027 group of moderates to develop policies. In an interview with Sky News on Friday night, Mr Corbyn said he did not believe bullying existed in Labour on a wide scale.When confronted with quotes from prominent Jews accusing him of not doing enough, he said there were \u0027very many other people in the Jewish community\u0027 who were happy.A Labour Party spokesman said: \u0027The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms. All complaints about anti-Semitism are investigated in line with our rules.\u0027Theresa May offers new Commons vote on delaying Brexit | London Evening Standard"},{"url":null,"title":"Karren Brady steps role chairman Taveta","story":"    Sir Philip Green and Baroness Karren Brady, pictured together in London in January 2012.

Rosemary Kennedy (pictured before her lobotomy) was one of Freeman\u0027s patients, ruining her youthful good looks and condemning her to live in medical institutions for the rest of her lifeWhile she was docile as an adolescent, Rosemary became prone to outbursts when she hit puberty and started worrying her parents when she started escaping from her boarding school at night. When she was 23 her father Joe Kennedy secretly took her to get a lobotomy that left her incapacitated for the rest of her life. She died in a medical institution in 2005. When asked about the family tragedy, Rose addressed her daughter\u0027s condition but refused to elaborate about the procedure. \u0027Rosemary\u0027s mind is gone completely,\u0027 Rose said. \u0027That was due to an accident, which I don\u0027t really discuss.\u0027 Rose watched four of her nine children die early deaths - her eldest Joe Jr in World War II, sons Jack and Bobby in assassinations and daughter Kathleen in a plane crash.     Despite having no formal surgical training, Freeman performed over 3,400 lobotomies from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s.  He boasted that he was so good at lobotomies that he could perform the debilitating procedure in only ten minutes.  The physician would take photographs of his patients before and after the lobotomy, in order to promote the notorious practice. In one of the transformation photographs, it is stated that Freeman\u0027s female patients was schizophrenic prior to the procedure and all that could be done was to turn into her a \u0027veritable household pet\u0027.Despite the public awareness of the lobotomy\u0027s debilitating side effects - and its 14 per cent fatality rate - the operation continued until the 1970s.   Rampaging elephant charges into raft and knocks screaming...Burning Man around the world: Nude dancers, neon fish and...Share this article    Advertising: A before-and-after shot of a 27-year-old patient who Walter Freeman said was suffering from catatonic schizophrenia before the procedure.

In the second picture (right) taken one year after her operation, she is described as being \u0027indolent and euphoric, and subject to convulsive seizures, but she made no complaints\u0027          This woman was suffering from schizophrenia when she underwent Freeman\u0027s lobotomy in 1948. In the right-hand picture she is seen apparently looking well and it is written that she continued well for six months afterwards           Freeman said this patient was worried because he couldn\u0027t find a job, and couldn\u0027t find a job because he worried so much. The picture on the right is taken December 1940 and it\u0027s written that the lobotomy broke through his vicious circle and he found a job and peace of mind.          Freeman stated that this woman was schizophrenic and all that could be done was to turn her into a \u0027veritable household pet\u0027.Portugese doctor António Egas Moniz first developed the modern lobotomy in 1935, traveling abroad to promote the method, for which he received a Nobel Prize. He inspired Walter Freeman, who was based in Washington, to take up the procedure. During the surgery a metal tool was inserted through the eye socket into the skull cavity, and wrenched around to sever the connections of the pre-frontal cortex from the rest of the brain.  Almost 50,000 people received lobotomies during the 1940s and 1950s in the United States alone. Some survivors were left with no noticeable differences, but others were physically damaged for life or lived in a persistent vegetative state.           Freeman\u0027s caption on this image reads: \u0027The change in personality suggested here is typical of that which usually follows prefrontal lobotomy.

He is seen above posing in the press room Seated in the audience, a visibly angry Lee waved his hands in disgust and appeared to try to walk out of the Dolby Theatre. He made his way back to his seat and later backstage to answer questions.\u0027This is my sixth glass, and you know why,\u0027 he said, smiling and holding a champagne flute aloft when he met with reporters. He briefly touched on his reaction to the Green Book win.Newly single Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper set Twitter alight...\u0027There are no borders or walls that can restrain ingenuity...Share this article\u0027I’m snake-bit.

Shortly after winning his award, he nearly stormed out of the theater after it was announced that Green Book won Best Picture, defeating Lee\u0027s film which was also nominated.

That year, Driving Miss Daisy (right) won best picture. Lee joked on Sunday: \u0027I’m snake-bit.

Theresa May (left) has a breakfast meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) at the EU-League of Arab States Summit in  Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Amid a bitter standoff the PM has admitted a final vote on her Brexit plan could be delayed until just 17 days before the EU exit dateThe issue of postponing Brexit came up \u0027fleetingly\u0027 during the discussions between Mrs May and Mrs Merkel this morning, according to Downing Street. But a spokesman said the PM simply repeated that she wanted the UK to leave with a deal on March 29. Speaking at a press conference to close the summit, Mr Tusk said: \u0027Prime Minister May and I discussed yesterday a lot of issues including the legal and procedural context of a potential extension. \u0027For me it is absolutely clear that (if) there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal, we will face an alternative - chaotic Brexit or extension. \u0027The less time there is until March 29, the greater the likelihood of an extension. \u0027This is an objective fact, not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact. Cue ridicule!

An amendment tabled by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Oliver Letwin - to be put to a vote on Wednesday - would force Mrs May to seek an extension if a deal has not been approved by MPs by March 13.Ms Cooper, a former Labour minister, said on Monday it would allow Parliament to tell the Prime Minister to seek an extension to the negotiation process but leave it in the Government\u0027s hands to decide how long it should be.Mrs May could seek to take matters into her own hands as early as tomorrow when she makes a Commons statement.This could theoretically see off a rebellion by Remain-supporting MPs and ministers who are threatening to back Cooper-Letwin.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested there was a possibility of Mrs May herself announcing an extension of the two-year Article 50 negotiation process beyond March 29.Mr Ellwood told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \u0027The Prime Minister is listening and is recognising the fact that we have tried very, very hard in order to secure a deal.\u0027Go long The EU is said to favour a longer delay, possibly up to 21 months.Plans being considered in Brussels would see the transition period due to follow on if the UK leaves with a deal replaced by staying in the EU proper, the Guardian reported. This would allow for deeper talks on the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the aim of making the Irish border backstop - the main sticking point in the drawn-out negotiations - redundant.The possibility of extending Article 50 was raised when May met with German chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday in Egypt. Nuclear optionBritain could unilaterally reverse Article 50 and stay in the EU until the deal is done. A European court ruled last year that this can be done by the UK without seeking consent from other EU states, whereas extending the Article 50 period would require agreement from the other 27 capitals. But it would also be likely to see Brexiteers in Mrs May\u0027s party explode with rage and could speed up her demise.                            Mrs May met European Union Council President Donald Tusk, right, on the sidelines of the summit yesterday          Prime Minister Theresa May is hugged by the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko BorissovBut she refused to criticise the rebel trio and ducked questions about whether the fragile state of her Government made the ministers \u0027unsackable\u0027.Mrs May said: \u0027Collective responsibility has not broken down. What we\u0027ve seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe. That\u0027s not a surprise to anybody.\u0027We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire to actually ensure we leave the EU with a deal. That\u0027s what we\u0027re working for, that\u0027s what I\u0027m working for.\u0027We\u0027ve been having positive talks with the EU. As you know we were in Brussels last week, my team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be returning to Brussels this Tuesday.    If the backbench motion is passed, Mrs May would have until March 13 to get her plan through Parliament or be forced to seek a delay in the process          Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels\u0027As a result of that we won\u0027t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that happens by March 12. It is still within our grasp to leave the EU with a deal on March 29. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re working to do.\u0027Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith last night said that by delaying the meaningful vote, Mrs May was effectively \u0027calling the bluff\u0027 of the Cabinet rebels.\u0027They are smashing the whole concept of government,\u0027 he said.

Another Labour MP, Louise Ellman, is on the brink of leaving after more than 50 years.A friend said: \u0027Louise will not be in the party for much longer.\u0027The third MP, Siobhain McDonagh, said on Friday she had decided not to resign \u0027this week\u0027 – meaning a decision to go could come soon.Dame Margaret, a former minister who has faced months of abuse from hard-Left activists, said: \u0027This is the final wake-up call for Jeremy Corbyn. The leadership has so lost trust but I don\u0027t believe any of the figures they come out with on the cases they\u0027ve dealt with. I\u0027ve had pretty horrific abuse on Twitter. It absolutely doesn\u0027t feel to me like there is zero tolerance on anti-Semitism.\u0027 Dame Louise said: \u0027I am still fighting with the party\u0027s failure to deal with anti-Semitism.\u0027An unpublished Labour Party report into Dame Louise\u0027s Liverpool Riverside constituency found she was physically threatened by one member and \u0027there have been CLP meetings during which anti-Semitic incidents are alleged to have taken place\u0027.The report said: \u0027These have arisen as a result of \u0027obsessive interrogations\u0027 of the MP over the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some members have felt that others are holding the MP – a Jewish woman – personally accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.\u0027The 11 members of the Independent Group will meet today to discuss organisation, including how to elect a leader. Yesterday Chuka Umunna called on voters to \u0027join us, and help us forge a new, different kind of politics\u0027.A poll for The Observer puts the group\u0027s support at 6 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems. It has also emerged that Sir David Garrard, once one of Labour\u0027s biggest donors, is supporting the new group.                         Tom Watson said Mr Corbyn had to \u0027change very, very rapidly\u0027 to stop more MPs from following the nine who quit the party last week.He also revealed he had handed the party leader a dossier of 50 cases where no adequate action had been taken over racist comments on social media about Jewish iniduals.In a TV interview, he demanded Mr Corbyn take personal charge of rooting out anti-Semitism because the \u0027party machine\u0027 had failed. And he urged him to change tack on Brexit and push for a second referendum.\u0027The departure of our colleagues is a real blow, and we need to understand why they felt the need to go. Because if we\u0027re going to be in government we need to address those concerns.\u0027For us to hold this party together, things have to change. There\u0027s almost a crisis for the soul of the Labour Party now. I absolutely fear that we will lose more parliamentary colleagues. We may lose peers from the House of Lords, and we may lose members and councillors and I don\u0027t want that to happen.\u0027Mr Watson said Luciana Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP who left for the Independent Group last week, had been \u0027bullied out of the Labour Party by a small number of racist thugs\u0027 and he was \u0027very very sad to see her go\u0027.Hard-Left activists, he said, were causing irreparable harm by \u0027pouncing\u0027 on MPs, and bullying them on social media. Details of the anti-Semitism dossier, seen by the Mail, show it included vicious racist abuse. One said of Jewish Labour MPs: \u0027I don\u0027t know what runs through their veins, not human blood.\u0027Mr Watson said Labour general secretary Jenny Formby\u0027s attempts to combat anti-Semitism had \u0027very patently not been adequate\u0027 and Mr Corbyn should take a personal lead.On Brexit, he said Mr Corbyn needed to \u0027reunify our party\u0027 and move towards a second referendum.He also called for more centrist Labour MPs to be given jobs on the front bench and said he was going to set up a new \u0027social democratic\u0027 group of moderates to develop policies. In an interview with Sky News on Friday night, Mr Corbyn said he did not believe bullying existed in Labour on a wide scale.When confronted with quotes from prominent Jews accusing him of not doing enough, he said there were \u0027very many other people in the Jewish community\u0027 who were happy.A Labour Party spokesman said: \u0027The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.

Rosemary Kennedy (pictured before her lobotomy) was one of Freeman\u0027s patients, ruining her youthful good looks and condemning her to live in medical institutions for the rest of her lifeWhile she was docile as an adolescent, Rosemary became prone to outbursts when she hit puberty and started worrying her parents when she started escaping from her boarding school at night. When she was 23 her father Joe Kennedy secretly took her to get a lobotomy that left her incapacitated for the rest of her life. She died in a medical institution in 2005. When asked about the family tragedy, Rose addressed her daughter\u0027s condition but refused to elaborate about the procedure. \u0027Rosemary\u0027s mind is gone completely,\u0027 Rose said. \u0027That was due to an accident, which I don\u0027t really discuss.\u0027 Rose watched four of her nine children die early deaths - her eldest Joe Jr in World War II, sons Jack and Bobby in assassinations and daughter Kathleen in a plane crash.     Despite having no formal surgical training, Freeman performed over 3,400 lobotomies from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s.  He boasted that he was so good at lobotomies that he could perform the debilitating procedure in only ten minutes.  The physician would take photographs of his patients before and after the lobotomy, in order to promote the notorious practice. In one of the transformation photographs, it is stated that Freeman\u0027s female patients was schizophrenic prior to the procedure and all that could be done was to turn into her a \u0027veritable household pet\u0027.Despite the public awareness of the lobotomy\u0027s debilitating side effects - and its 14 per cent fatality rate - the operation continued until the 1970s.   Rampaging elephant charges into raft and knocks screaming...Burning Man around the world: Nude dancers, neon fish and...Share this article    Advertising: A before-and-after shot of a 27-year-old patient who Walter Freeman said was suffering from catatonic schizophrenia before the procedure.

Of course, we will look at the detail of it carefully.          About 2,000 people were evicted from the islands, with many resettling in Britain, Mauritius (pictured) and Seychelles. The UK has said the islands will be returned to Mauritius when the need for military facilities ends\u0027The defence facilities on the British Indian Ocean Territory help to protect people here in Britain and around the world from terrorist threats, organised crime and piracy.\u0027The ICJ said the opinion the UK should ends its administration was given with a majority of 13 votes to one.Another part of its advisory opinion which said \u0027member states are under an obligation to co-operate with the United Nations in order to complete the decolonisation\u0027 was given with the same majority.\u0027After recalling the circumstances in which the colony of Mauritius agreed in principle to such a detachment, the court considers that this detachment was not based on the free and genuine expression of the will of the people concerned,\u0027 the ICJ said.The resettlement of Mauritian nationals on the islands should be \u0027addressed by the General Assembly\u0027 during the completion of decolonisation, it added.About 2,000 people were evicted from the islands, with many resettling in Britain, Mauritius and Seychelles.The UK has said the islands will be returned to Mauritius when the need for military facilities ends.Rosa Curling, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, who represents Solange Hoareau, a Chagossian woman fighting a legal battle to return, said: \u0027We are considering the judgment carefully with our client, but clearly the UK should stop breaching international law.\u0027The time has come to allow the islanders to return home.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"School cleaner stuffed 25 iPads trousers said gift doing great job","story":"Pictured: Man, 23, who was stabbed to death in \u0027targeted\u0027...Share this articleShe must also carry out 180 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay back £600 for some of the iPads.Robert Short, from the CPS, said after the hearing: \u0027Fiona Rabess had worked at the school for more than two years and was a trusted member of cleaning staff.

Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor    I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’ve have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi!

Allies of the Prime Minister revealed that the Cabinet will discuss proposals this morning that could see the UK request a short extension of Article 50 of around two months if the PM’s deal is voted down by MPs again, for a second time, on March 12.If ministers back the plan Mrs May could float the idea in a statement to Parliament as early as this afternoon.The idea is a desperate bid to stave off the mass rebellion by ministers and avert a looming Commons defeat tomorrow over the motion put forward by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory Sir Oliver Letwin that would empower Parliament to force a Brexit delay on the Government.   Up to 25 Tory backbenchers are also threatening to back tomorrow’s revolt (left: Mrs May at the  Arab-European Summit.

Energy minister Claire Perry, right, ‘implores’ Mrs May to say that if there is no deal agreed by Parliament by March 13 then she must seek a way to extend Article 50  As many as 15 ministers could resign and vote for the motion unless Mrs May provides assurances on No Deal today, including anti-Brexit Cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, left, and Greg Clark, right    Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire PerryNow that we know that there will be no parliamentary vote on a deal for Britain to exit the European Union until March 12 three things are clear.First, if an agreement is not reached and endorsed by then, Britain would crash out on the most basic and disruptive terms on March 29.Second, even if an agreement were to be reached by March 12, it would be too late to have it ratified by the European Council of Ministers, the UK Parliament and the European Parliament before Brexit day, just over a fortnight later.Third, British businesses have been plunged into depths of uncertainty and dismay that is ruinous for the interests of the millions of working men and women whose livelihoods depend on the confidence of their employers.The British Chambers of Commerce, representing small firms in every part of the UK said it is “unbelievable” that there is just “17 days’ notice for businesses, employees, investors and communities on what may be the biggest economic and trading change they face in a generation”.We can’t go on like this. All three facts point to the same conclusion: we must act immediately to ensure that we are not swept over the precipice on March 29.The way to do that is to seek a short extension to Article 50 to allow the negotiations to be completed, the legislation to pass and for the panic that businesses face to subside.It would not take No Deal off the table – only an agreed deal can do that. It would not affect the conduct of the negotiation – both sides are fully aware of the impossibility of ratifying a deal done after this week without an extension to Article 50.But what it would do is to help save the jobs of thousands of people whose employers risk taking flight rather than putting up any longer with the enforced ignorance they have of how to trade with their most important suppliers and customers.The best way to do this is for the Government to take a cool-headed, sensible step.It should say that if there is no deal agreed, it will seek a way to extend Article 50 to avoid leaving with No Deal on March 29. It is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees.We implore the Government to take that step this week.But if the Prime Minister is not able to make this commitment, we will have no choice other than to join MPs of all parties in the House of Commons, including fellow ministers, in acting in the national interest to prevent a disaster in less than five weeks’ time that we may regret forever.                         "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdd9a028c47800aadd1a113ea34cfdb911140ddd/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c7ab766fa8ef6ddd085ac9a2bc7b76e","title":"from twitter to teachmeets how social learning is shaping teaching","story":"Teachers are taking the lead from students when it comes to embracing networking and learning opportunities, as they make the most of online support and ‘open-space’ meetingsFrom working together to create a presentation to swapping revision tips on WhatsApp, social learning is becoming second nature for pupils, both in the classroom and at home. Creating a positive atmosphere where students can share skills and help each other boosts their creativity and confidence – and helps them get great new ideas as well. So it’s no surprise that having seen their students thrive, teachers across the UK are following suit: they’re embracing social learning to develop their professional skills and networks.“I feel that there’s been a real shift in thinking in this area,” says Paul Morgan, business development manager at CER Education Recruitment. “We recently contributed to a #WomenEd event, for example, a network created to connect, inspire, develop, promote and give confidence to the next generation of women leaders in education.“When we’ve been out speaking to teachers and network leaders, we found that many people thought they were the only ones who had been in their particular situation before. They had never before had a sounding board – a network of people either online or in real life. Now, there’s always somewhere you can go to ask for advice.”So what exactly does this social learning involve? It’s a catch-all term for teachers learning from teachers in an informal but organised setting, rather than the traditional top-down classroom-style of continuing professional development (CPD). This learning might take place between teachers online – during a Twitter chat, for example – or it could be in real life at an event such as a TeachMeet, a Pedagoo conference or a WomenEd “unconference”.All these movements have something in common: they’re grassroots and volunteer-led. TeachMeets, for example, originated with a group of teachers in Scotland in 2006. The concept is simple: teachers meet up to share good practice, practical innovations and personal insights in teaching.Leadership consultant Harrison Owen’s idea “open space”, from the 1980s, inspired TeachMeets. When people get together to learn, he argued, they are more creative and productive if that meeting is fluid and organic, rather than operating within a rigid framework. So TeachMeets are free. There is no central organising body: anyone can volunteer to organise one, and anyone can present at one. Hundreds of TeachMeets now take place across the globe: just search on Twitter for the #TeachMeet hashtag and you’ll find teachers all over the world who share the movement’s ethos.Like that other great grassroots voluntary movement, Parkrun, there are a few rules. Presentations are either “nano” (two minutes long) or “micro” (seven minutes long). They must cover an aspect of good practice or a tool that enhances classroom practice. Order of presentations is chosen at random on the night. And for reasons lost in the mists of time, if you go over your allotted time, expect to have a toy camel chucked at you! TeachMeets are a fantastic way to not just gather ideas, but also to connect in real life with teachers in your area, helping you build your professional network.Pedagoo, another not-for-profit and voluntary movement, grew out of a collaborative blog created – again – by a group of teachers in Scotland. They organise teacher-led conferences every Saturday and run a lively Twitter hashtag, #PedagooFriday, where teachers post tips, experiences and triumphs. A typical #PedagooFriday takes in everything from the joy of conveying to a parent how well their child has done to the drama students’ highly creative examples of Halloween makeup. Again, the idea is simple: to provide a positive, teacher-led space for teachers to share what works.And aside from these movements, teachers have embraced simply using Twitter. The Twitter feeds of teachers such as @just-maths (23,900 followers) and @vicgoddard (21,600 followers) are great places to pitch a question or share a dilemma.Each subject has its own Twitter specialists, and that’s not even counting the potential to connect with big names to get amazing work out there. (Authors Michael Rosen and Neil Gaiman, to name just two, like to share Tweets from teachers using their books in the classroom to their thousands of followers.)Social learning is also having an impact on how CPD is delivered across the board. “It used to be very rigid – you must do this to get this particular impact,” says Morgan. “Now they’re incorporating different elements to get the best standard: collaborations with outstanding schools who will deliver CPD for us, for example, rather than doing everything online.”It’s an exciting time for teachers who love to share what works for them. The new Ofsted framework is due in 2019, putting less emphasis on exam results and data, and more on delivering a broad, rich and deep learning experience. “We’re hoping it will allow teachers to show their creative flair and deliver exciting and stimulating lessons,” says Morgan. And now those fabulous ideas are just a click or a TeachMeet away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d305370075686a053b46f5c0e6384e32b3c00f97/0_9_5231_3138/master/5231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a483b1bb12e0e8c64db4e933c1458f8","title":"secondhand books the murky world of literary plagiarism","story":"Disputes involving AJ Finn, romance writers and even filmmaker Danny Boyle are in the news – but showing someone stole your idea is close to impossible“As if there was much of anything in any human utterance, oral or written, except plagiarism!” opined Mark Twain more than 100 years ago. “The kernel, the soul – let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances – is plagiarism.”“I have ever since been tortured by the fear that what I write is not my own.” she wrote. “It is certain that I cannot always distinguish my own thoughts from those I read, because what I read becomes the very substance and texture of my mind … My compositions are made up of crude notions of my own, inlaid with the brighter thoughts and riper opinions of the authors I have read.”Or, as Nicola Solomon at the Society of Authors puts it, “fiction writers are magpies”. This month alone, we have seen the New York Times note the “striking” similarities between AJ Finn’s bestselling mystery The Woman in the Window and a self-published novel released two years before, a romance writer who blamed her ghostwriter for copying passages from other writers’ books, and Australian author Nick Milligan pointing out the common features in his novel Enormity and Danny Boyle’s forthcoming film Yesterday.In 2006, Ian McEwan was forced to defend himself from claims he had plagiarised the work of Lucilla Andrews’ autobiography in his novel Atonement. In 2007, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh failed to prove that Dan Brown’s novel The Da Vinci Code copied their earlier non-fiction work The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. And last summer, a judge dismissed a lawsuit from Emma Cline’s ex-boyfriend, who alleged her debut novel The Girls infringed his copyright.Solomon says the Society is often contacted by authors complaining that another has pilfered an idea. “Some cases are absolutely straightforward, but legal action is very tricky in cases which don’t concern actual language copying but rely on copying of themes, plots or structure. They’re expensive to take, they depend on line-by-line checking of work and unfortunately many authors don’t have the funds to go against large publishing or film companies to take action with no guarantee of success.”It has long been claimed that there are somewhere between three and 36 basic plots in all forms of storytelling. Three years ago, academics fed nearly 2,000 stories into a computer analysis and concluded that there were six “core trajectories” for all stories. None of these common plots, however, include a character called Jack who passes off the Beatles’ music as his own on another planet (Milligan’s Enormity and Boyle’s new film), or an alcoholic, agoraphobic woman who watches a crime play out in the house opposite her own (Finn’s bestseller and British author Sarah A Denzil’s Saving April).Milligan told  Australia last week that he felt the similarities were “probably just a horrible coincidence and they mean me no disrespect”. As for Finn and Denzil, the similarities came to light this month after the New Yorker ran an exposé about Finn, a pseudonym for the publisher Dan Mallory, who has a history of lying about his professional history and health, including a brain cancer diagnosis.Finn’s thriller was published in January 2018 Denzil’s novel was self-published in March 2016. Reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have pointed out the similarities between the two books for months. “Almost the same thing” says one Goodreads reviewer on Saving April. “Seems so similar to Girl in the Window. Feels like I just read a different version of that,” runs an Amazon review of Denzil’s book.The New York Times recently noted the parallels between the two being “numerous, and detailed”. And they are (spoilers ahead): both centre on a woman who has lost a child and partner through a car accident for which she blames herself, a fact that isn’t at first revealed. Both feature a new family moving in opposite, whom the agoraphobe watches. She becomes convinced the husband is abusing the wife and befriends their adopted teenager who, after gaining her trust, turns out to be the villain.Denzil, real name Sarah Dalton, told the  she had noticed the similarities herself when she read The Woman in the Window. She said she started writing Saving April in October 2015, submitting it to Amazon’s Kindle Scout programme, which displayed a sample of text from the novel, the blurb and the cover on its website in December 2015. It went on to Amazon as a pre-order and was published on 29 March 2016.The New Yorker profile identified another work similar to The Woman in the Window: the 1995 film Copycat, starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. The film and the novel both see a psychologist become trapped in her home by agoraphobia, drink too much, be mistrusted by the police and join a forum that turns out to be dangerous. The director of Copycat, Jon Amiel, told the New Yorker that the debt was “not actionable, but certainly worth noting, and one would have hoped that the author might have noted it himself”.Mallory himself has been open about being inspired by other works, including Gillian Flynn, Kate Atkinson and the Hitchcock film Rear Window, which he says he had just finished watching when the idea came to him. But both Mallory’s literary agent and his publisher have said that the outline of The Woman in the Window, including characters and main plot points, was fully formed by 20 September 2015, before Saving April was released. Mallory submitted a 7,500 word outline that day – a month before Denzil began writing her novel.When the New York Times published its story about Saving April, Mallory’s lawyer allowed a Times reporter to look at the outlines the author sent to his agent on 20 September and 4 October. “Some of the overlapping plot points, including the fact that both protagonists were fighting with their husbands about infidelity before the car crashes, and that the psychopathic teenager tortured animals, while not in the original outline, were contained in the October version … Mr Mallory’s attorney said Mr Mallory has never read Saving April,” said the paper, in an addition to its original story.Solomon said: “It’s bound to happen to an extent, but sometimes things go over the line.” She won’t comment on particular cases, but advises all writers to document every source and submission of their work from the earliest stage possible.“That can help if you want to take action but also protects authors when it is alleged that they have copied others. It also protects you from inadvertently copying an idea by forgetting that you picked it up elsewhere and thinking it was original to you,” she adds. “Much copying is unconscious – though that is no defence.”TS Eliot had it that “immature poets imitate mature poets steal” – a line once echoed by Mallory. “It is often said that ‘good writers borrow, great writers steal’,” he told the Observer in 2018. “If I had not read the work of Flynn or Atkinson I wouldn’t have written the book I did.”Or, as Twain put it in his letter to Keller: “substantially all ideas are second-hand”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cbdcdf0eee4a2424824fbddcb0389b23baa76c2/356_344_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f45977c7fb78ee712e32bbc8870a6904","title":"analysts urge caution over hopes for us china trade solution","story":"Trade tensions between the US and China could rapidly rekindle despite rising hopes of a deal, analysts have warned, after Donald Trump promised to pause the launch of higher import tariffs on Chinese goods.Analysts, however, struck a note of caution after Trump told a group of US governors on Monday that, while he hoped a trade deal could be swiftly reached, there was still a chance that it might not.Financial markets around the world jumped after Trump first signalled the easing of trade tensions on Twitter late on Sunday, saying that “substantial progress” had been made in talks between the US and China. He also said that should additional progress be made then meetings could take place between himself and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to conclude a deal.The Dow Jones industrial average was up by more than 150 points in early trading in New York, while markets across Europe also rallied.Economists sounded a note of caution over the chances of complete resolution of the US-China trade dispute, which has rattled the global economy over the past year, as a drag on world trade. Xinhua, the Chinese state-run, news agency also cautioned that talks would be harder in the final stages.Paul Donovan, the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, said: “It has been clear for some time the US president was keen for a trade deal. At times almost desperate for a trade deal. While a positive reaction is justified, there is perhaps a limit to the upside.”Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia economics at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said that the president’s comments were “clearly not the end of the negotiations, let alone the underlying tension between the two countries”.“There is no reason to turn overoptimistic,” he said. “We don’t expect the existing tariffs to be reduced any time soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30ba7187029a070c4a91b0c12103f566e623b94/0_189_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a444d30ae6a74df5faa41e66d64562fe","title":"karren brady birmingham city west ham philip green","story":"Success at Birmingham City and West Ham followed by peerage and role at Philip Green empireKarren Brady has succeeded in arenas dominated by largely unreconstructed men.

A supporter of David Cameron and George Osborne, the 49-year-old is one of just 206 women in the House of Lords (out of a total of 783 peers).She has also famously advised Lord Sugar on The Apprentice, as well as Simon Cowell and the former pornographer David Sullivan. It was Sullivan who gave Brady her first big break in 1993 when she convinced him to buy Birmingham City out of receivership. He installed her as chief executive when she was just 23, but told her she would have to be twice as good as a man to run the club, to which Brady replied: “Well that’s not difficult.”During her first press conference at Birmingham, she was asked for her vital statistics. And early on at the club, a player commented: “I can see your tits in that shirt.” Brady replied: “Well, don’t worry, when I sell you to Crewe you won’t be able to see them from there, will you?”. Three days later she sold him. “It was the best deal I ever did,” she told the  last year.She moved to West Ham, where she is vice-chair under the owners Sullivan and David Gold. Rumours have suggested she is actually an Arsenal supporter, but Brady’s website says she “is not an Arsenal fan, and her footballing loyalties have only ever lay with the two clubs she has represented”.Brady grew up in Edmonton, north London, near Tottenham Hotspur’s ground. Her Irish father, Terry, was a self-made Rolls-Royce-driving millionaire, having worked in property and printing. Her Italian mother, Rita, was a full-time mum. She was sent to an all-girls’ Catholic boarding school, which she hated. “You do what you’re told, you wear what you’re told, you eat what you’re told, you go to bed when you’re told,” she said last year. “I was sick of being told what to do. The one thing I wanted was independence. And I realised to have that independence, you needed financial independence.” After passing nine O-levels, she left to join the sixth form of a former all-boys’ school – one of only six girls.A lifelong Conservative supporter, Brady introduced the then chancellor George Osborne at the Tory party conference in 2013. She was subsequently appointed as the government’s small business ambassador. A year later she became a Conservative life peer. “I think it’s a bit like any industry that has never marketed itself to women,” she has said of politics. “A bit like football.”At the same time she built up a series of business interests, including in 2017 accepting Sir Philip Green’s offer to become chair of his family’s Taveta Investments company, which owns Arcadia Group including the Topshop and Miss Selfridge brands. Her brief was to “beef up corporate oversight” and “sort out” corporate governance issues.As a vocal campaigner for women in business, Brady has come under increasing pressure to speak out over allegations of racial and sexual harassment made against Green. He denies the allegations. Dragons Den’s Duncan Bannatyne has described her continued employment at Taveta as “disgusting”.Two weeks ago Brady said she would stay at the company out of duty to Arcadia’s employees, including her daughter Sophia Peschisolido, who is a model. “I hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/305c0a50d004fd4d607fdb820f11319492285864/0_332_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56b8a775fbe93cc3993f8a0d80ba4cab","title":"karren brady faces questions about philip green allegations","story":"Outgoing chair called on to tell ‘what went on under her watch’ at tycoon’s retail empireKarren Brady has quit as chair of Sir Philip Green’s retail empire and faced immediate questions over what she knew of alleged sexual and racial harassment by the disgraced business tycoon.Brady walked away after two years in the job and a fortnight after she vowed to remain in her post out of a “sense of duty” to look out for the firm’s staff, including her daughter, who works on Topshop’s social media accounts.The Labour MP Jess Phillips called on Brady, 49, to “answer to what went on under her watch” following claims that Green’s company paid two staff about £1m each to settle sexual harassment and racial abuse claims.The allegations include that the billionaire groped a female employee and told a black executive that his “problem” was that he was still “throwing spears in the jungle”. Two other female employees received hundreds of thousands of pounds each after alleging that Green had grabbed one woman by the face and put another in a headlock.Brady, a Conservative peer, was chair of Taveta Investments, the company that ultimately owns the Green family empire of Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins outlets.A star of The Apprentice and campaigner for “strong female leadership”, Brady quit following mounting pressure to speak out against Green. She refused to explain why she had resigned. Taveta also announced the resignation of the non-executive director Sharon Brown, an experienced retail executive.Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, who sits on the women and equalities committee and backbench business committee, said: “Karren Brady will still have to answer to what went on under her watch and so she should, but it is Green who is ultimately responsible and, like always, it feels like powerful men can get away with anything.”Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Brady “has decided she can’t defend the indefensible”.Green, 66, who was described by a committee of MPs as the “the unacceptable face of capitalism” for his role in the collapse of BHS, has said he “categorically” denies any “unlawful sexual or racist behaviour”.The Dragon’s Den star Duncan Bannatyne had described Brady as a “hypocrite” for continuing to work for Green despite using her high profile to attack “serial predators” such as the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the actor Kevin Spacey and the former minister Michael Fallon.“I think it’s disgusting that she’s on the payroll of a billionaire who hasn’t got a great history with women,” Bannatyne said this month.Brady had refused to quit, saying two weeks ago: “I hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder.”Brady, who has built a reputation as one of the UK’s most prominent and successful female business leaders, has a track record of publicly shaming powerful men accused of sexual harassment.She denounced Weinstein as “a serial predator with such colossal amounts of power that people think they have no choice but to put up with grotesque advances if they want a career in Hollywood”.“Lots of men are asking: ‘When is it appropriate to touch a colleague?’ If you are in doubt, how about … NEVER?”In another column, she wrote: “It’s not just film. There is a Harvey Weinstein in every industry – the man at the top who abuses their power, who has no respect for women, who thinks women owe him something and it is a perfectly reasonable trade-off to exchange sex for work.”Brady has not spoken about the allegations against Green. In her book Strong Woman, she said: “He is without doubt the most dynamic, the most energetic, the most relentless businessperson I have ever come across, a whirlwind of energy and ideas.”Bannatyne said on Monday that Brady “should be answering questions about what she knew of the alleged non-disclosure agreements”.Green appointed Brady as chair of Taveta in 2017 with a mandate to “beef up corporate oversight” and “sort out” corporate governance problems. She has been on the board of Taveta, which is controlled by Green’s wife, Tina, since 2010.The company said: “Taveta would like to announce that Karren Brady and Sharon Brown (in their respective capacities as non-executive chairman and non-executive director) have resigned from its board. Taveta thanks them for their contribution and wishes them well for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f69da012dfe6924635beb6d0ea69b799788c8ed/0_0_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d83bb52c76114bf0a0fb7066550a02f","title":"concrete the most destructive material on earth","story":"After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on the planet. But its benefits mask enormous dangers to the planet, to human health – and to culture itselfIn the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete. By the time you are halfway through this article, the volume would fill the Albert Hall and spill out into Hyde Park. In a day it would be almost the size of China’s Three Gorges Dam. In a single year, there is enough to patio over every hill, dale, nook and cranny in England.After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on Earth. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with up to 2.8bn tonnes, surpassed only by China and the US.The material is the foundation of modern development, putting roofs over the heads of billions, fortifying our defences against natural disaster and providing a structure for healthcare, education, transport, energy and industry.Concrete is how we try to tame nature. Our slabs protect us from the elements. They keep the rain from our heads, the cold from our bones and the mud from our feet. But they also entomb vast tracts of fertile soil, constipate rivers, choke habitats and – acting as a rock-hard second skin – desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses.Our species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.Can we kick our addiction, when it\u0027s so hard to imagine modern life without it? This week  Cities celebrates the aesthetic and social achievements of concrete, while investigating its innumerable harms, to learn what we can\u0026nbsp do to bring about a less grey world.\u0026nbspOur blue and green world is becoming greyer by the second. By one calculation, we may have already passed the point where concrete outweighs the combined carbon mass of every tree, bush and shrub on the planet. Our built environment is, in these terms, outgrowing the natural one. Unlike the natural world, however, it does not actually grow. Instead, its chief quality is to harden and then degrade, extremely slowly.All the plastic produced over the past 60 years amounts to 8bn tonnes. The concrete industry pumps out more than that every two years. But though the problem is bigger than plastic, it is generally seen as less severe. Concrete is not derived from fossil fuels. It is not being found in the stomachs of whales and seagulls. Doctors aren’t discovering traces of it in our blood. Nor do we see it tangled in oak trees or contributing to subterranean fatbergs. We know where we are with concrete. Or to be more precise, we know where it is going: nowhere. Which is exactly why we have come to rely on it.This solidity, of course, is what humankind yearns for. Concrete is beloved for its weight and endurance. That is why it serves as the foundation of modern life, holding time, nature, the elements and entropy at bay. When combined with steel, it is the material that ensures our dams don’t burst, our tower blocks don’t fall, our roads don’t buckle and our electricity grid remains connected.Solidity is a particularly attractive quality at a time of disorientating change. But – like any good thing in excess – it can create more problems than it solves. At times an unyielding ally, at times a false friend, concrete can resist nature for decades and then suddenly amplify its impact. Take the floods in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and Houston after Harvey, which were more severe because urban and suburban streets could not soak up the rain like a floodplain, and storm drains proved woefully inadequate for the new extremes of a disrupted climate. This touches on the most severe, but least understood, impact of concrete, which is that it destroys natural infrastructure without replacing the ecological functions that humanity depends on for fertilisation, pollination, flood control, oxygen production and water purification.Concrete can take our civilisation upwards, up to 163 storeys high in the case of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, creating living space out of the air. But it also pushes the human footprint outwards, sprawling across fertile topsoil and choking habitats. The bioersity crisis – which many scientists believe to be as much of a threat as climate chaos – is driven primarily by the conversion of wilderness to agriculture, industrial estates and residential blocks.For hundreds of years, humanity has been willing to accept this environmental downside in return for the undoubted benefits of concrete. But the balance may now be tilting in the other direction.The Pantheon and Colosseum in Rome are testament to the durability of concrete, which is a composite of sand, aggregate (usually gravel or stones) and water mixed with a lime-based, kiln-baked binder. The modern industrialised form of the binder – Portland cement – was patented as a form of “artificial stone” in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin in Leeds. This was later combined with steel rods or mesh to create reinforced concrete, the basis for art deco skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building.Rivers of it were poured after the second world war, when concrete offered an inexpensive and simple way to rebuild cities devastated by bombing. This was the period of brutalist architects such as Le Corbusier, followed by the futuristic, free-flowing curves of Oscar Niemeyer and the elegant lines of Tadao Ando – not to mention an ever-growing legion of dams, bridges, ports, city halls, university campuses, shopping centres and uniformly grim car parks. In 1950, cement production was equal to that of steel in the years since, it has increased 25-fold, more than three times as fast as its metallic construction partner.Debate about the aesthetics has tended to polarise between traditionalists like Prince Charles, who condemned Owen Luder’s brutalist Tricorn Centre as a “mildewed lump of elephant droppings”, and modernists who saw concrete as a means of making style, size and strength affordable for the masses.The politics of concrete are less isive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high. Hence the self-perpetuating political enthusiasm for environmentally and socially dubious infrastructure projects and cement-fests like the Olympics, the World Cup and international exhibitions.The classic example is Japan, which embraced concrete in the second half of the 20th century with such enthusiasm that the country’s governance structure was often described as the doken kokka (construction state).At first it was a cheap material to rebuild cities ravaged by fire bombs and nuclear warheads in the second world war. Then it provided the foundations for a new model of super-rapid economic development: new railway tracks for Shinkansen bullet trains, new bridges and tunnels for elevated expressways, new runways for airports, new stadiums for the 1964 Olympics and the Osaka Expo, and new city halls, schools and sports facilities.This kept the economy racing along at near double-digit growth rates until the late 1980s, ensuring employment remained high and giving the ruling Liberal Democratic party a stranglehold on power. The political heavyweights of the era – men such as Kakuei Tanaka, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita – were judged by their ability to bring hefty projects to their hometowns. Huge kickbacks were the norm. Yakuza gangsters, who served as go-betweens and enforcers, also got their cut. Bid-rigging and near monopolies by the big six building firms (Shimizu, Taisei, Kajima, Takenaka, Obayashi, Kumagai) ensured contracts were lucrative enough to provide hefty kickbacks to the politicians. The doken kokka was a racket on a national scale.In his book Dogs and Demons, the author and longtime Japanese resident Alex Kerr laments the cementing over of riverbanks and hillsides in the name of flood and mudslide prevention. Runaway government-subsidised construction projects, he told an interviewer, “have wreaked untold damage on mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, everywhere — and it goes on at a heightened pace. That is the reality of modern Japan, and the numbers are staggering.”Traditionalists and environmentalists were horrified – and ignored. The cementation of Japan ran contrary to classic aesthetic ideals of harmony with nature and an appreciation of mujo (impermanence), but was understandable given the ever-present fear of earthquakes and tsunamis in one of the world’s most seismically active nations. Everyone knew the grey banked rivers and shorelines were ugly, but nobody cared as long as they could keep their homes from being flooded.Which made the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami all the more shocking. At coastal towns such as Ishinomaki, Kamaishi and Kitakami, huge sea walls that had been built over decades were swamped in minutes. Almost 16,000 people died, a million buildings were destroyed or damaged, town streets were blocked with beached ships and port waters were filled with floating cars. It was a still more alarming story at Fukushima, where the ocean surge engulfed the outer defences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and caused a level 7 meltdown.Construction firms were once again ordered to hold back the sea, this time with even taller, thicker barriers. Their value is contested. Engineers claim these 12-metre-high walls of concrete will stop or at least slow future tsunamis, but locals have heard such promises before. The area these defences protect is also of lower human worth now the land has been largely depopulated and filled with paddy fields and fish farms. Environmentalists say mangrove forests could provide a far cheaper buffer. Tellingly, even many tsunami-scarred locals hate the concrete between them and the ocean.“It feels like we’re in jail, even though we haven’t done anything bad,” an oyster fisherman, Atsushi Fujita, told Reuters. “We can no longer see the sea,” said the Tokyo-born photographer Tadashi Ono, who took some of the most powerful images of these massive new structures. He described them as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. “Our richness as a civilisation is because of our contact with the ocean,” he said. “Japan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.”There was an inevitability about this. Across the world, concrete has become synonymous with development. In theory, the laudable goal of human progress is measured by a series of economic and social indicators, such as life-expectancy, infant mortality and education levels. But to political leaders, by far the most important metric is gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity that, more often than not, is treated as a calculation of economic size. GDP is how governments assess their weight in the world. And nothing bulks up a country like concrete.That is true of all countries at some stage. During their early stages of development, heavyweight construction projects are beneficial like a boxer putting on muscle. But for already mature economies, it is harmful like an aged athlete pumping ever stronger steroids to ever less effect. During the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Keynesian economic advisers told the Japanese government the best way to stimulate GDP growth was to dig a hole in the ground and fill it. Preferably with cement. The bigger the hole, the better. This meant profits and jobs. Of course, it is much easier to mobilise a nation to do something that improves people’s lives, but either way concrete is likely to be part of the arrangement. This was the thinking behind Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s, which is celebrated in the US as a recession-busting national project but might also be described as the biggest ever concrete-pouring exercise up until that point. The Hoover Dam alone required 3.3m cubic metres, then a world record. Construction firms claimed it would outlast human civilisation. But that was lightweight compared to what is now happening in China, the concrete superpower of the 21st century and the greatest illustration of how the material transforms a culture (a civilisation intertwined with nature) into an economy (a production unit obsessed by GDP statistics). Beijing’s extraordinarily rapid rise from developing nation to superpower-in-waiting has required mountains of cement, beaches of sand and lakes of water. The speed at which these materials are being mixed is perhaps the most astonishing statistic of the modern age: since 2003, China has poured more cement every three years than the US managed in the entire 20th century.Today, China uses almost half the world’s concrete. The property sector – roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other cement-and-steel projects – accounted for a third of its economy’s expansion in 2017. Every major city has a floor-sized scale model of urban development plans that has to be constantly updated as small white plastic models are turned into mega-malls, housing complexes and concrete towers.But, like the US, Japan, South Korea and every other country that “developed” before it, China is reaching the point where simply pouring concrete does more harm than good. Ghost malls, half-empty towns and white elephant stadiums are a growing sign of wasteful spending. Take the huge new airport in Luliang, which opened with barely five flights a day, or the Olympic Bird’s Nest stadium, so underused that it is now more a monument than a venue. Although the adage “build and the people will come” has often proved correct in the past, the Chinese government is worried. After the National Bureau of Statistics found 450 sq km of unsold residential floor space, the country’s president, Xi Jinping, called for the “annihilation” of excess developments.Empty, crumbling structures are not just an eyesore, but a drain on the economy and a waste of productive land. Ever greater construction requires ever more cement and steel factories, discharging ever more pollution and carbon dioxide. As the Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian has pointed out, it also suffocates the ecosystems – fertile soil, self-cleansing streams, storm-resisting mangrove swamps, flood-preventing forests – on which human beings ultimately depend. It is a threat to what he calls “eco-security”.Yu has led the charge against concrete, ripping it up whenever possible to restore riverbanks and natural vegetation. In his influential book The Art of Survival, he warns that China has moved dangerously far from Taoist ideals of harmony with nature. “The urbanisation process we follow today is a path to death,” he has said.Yu has been consulted by government officials, who are increasingly aware of the brittleness of the current Chinese model of growth. But their scope for movement is limited. The initial momentum of a concrete economy is always followed by inertia in concrete politics. The president has promised a shift of economic focus away from belching heavy industries and towards high-tech production in order to create a “beautiful country” and an “ecological civilisation”, and the government is now trying to wind down from the biggest construction boom in human history, but Xi cannot let the construction sector simply fade away, because it employs more than 55 million workers – almost the entire population of the UK. Instead, China is doing what countless other nations have done, exporting its environmental stress and excess capacity overseas.Beijing’s much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative – an overseas infrastructure investment project many times greater than the Marshall Plan – promises a splurge of roads in Kazakhstan, at least 15 dams in Africa, railways in Brazil and ports in Pakistan, Greece and Sri Lanka. To supply these and other projects, China National Building Material – the country’s biggest cement producer – has announced plans to construct 100 cement factories across 50 nations. This will almost certainly mean more criminal activity. As well as being the primary vehicle for super-charged national building, the construction industry is also the widest channel for bribes. In many countries, the correlation is so strong, people see it as an index: the more concrete, the more corruption.As elsewhere, the craze for concrete in South America’s biggest nation started benignly enough as a means of social development, then morphed into an economic necessity, and finally metastasised into a tool for political expediency and inidual greed. The progress between these stages was impressively rapid. The first huge national project in the late 1950s was the construction of a new capital, Brasília, on an almost uninhabited plateau in the interior. A million cubic metres of concrete were poured on the highlands site in just 41 months to encase the soil and erect new edifices for ministries and homes.This was followed by a new highway through the Amazon rainforest – the TransAmazonia – and then from 1970, South America’s biggest hydroelectric power plant, the Itaipu on the Paraná river border with Paraguay, which is almost four times bulkier than the Hoover Dam. The Brazilian operators boast the 12.3m cubic metres of concrete would be enough to fill 210 Maracaña stadiums. This was a world record until China’s Three Gorges Dam choked the Yangtze with 27.2m cubic metres.With the military in power, the press censored and no independent judiciary, there was no way of knowing how much of the budget was siphoned off by the generals and contractors. But the problem of corruption has become all too apparent since 1985 in the post-dictatorship era, with virtually no party or politician left untainted.For many years, the most notorious of them was Paulo Maluf, the governor of São Paulo, who had run the city during the construction of the giant elevated expressway known as Minhocão, which means Big Worm. As well as taking credit for this project, which opened in 1969, he also allegedly skimmed $1bn from public works in just four years, part of which has been traced to secret accounts in the British Virgin islands. Although wanted by Interpol, Maluf evaded justice for decades and was elected to a number of senior public offices. This was thanks to a high degree of public cynicism encapsulated by the phrase most commonly used about him: “He steals, but he gets things done” – which could describe much of the global concrete industry.But his reputation as the most corrupt man in Brazil has been overshadowed in the past five years by Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a vast network of bid-rigging and money laundering. Giant construction firms – notably Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and Camargo Corrêa – were at the heart of this sprawling scheme, which saw politicians, bureaucrats and middle-men receive at least $2bn worth of kickbacks in return for hugely inflated contracts for oil refineries, the Belo Monte dam, the 2014 World Cup, the 2016 Olympics and dozens of other infrastructure projects throughout the region. Prosecutors said Odebrecht alone had paid bribes to 415 politicians and 26 political parties.As a result of these revelations, one government fell, a former president of Brazil and the vice president of Ecuador are in prison, the president of Peru was forced to resign, and dozens of other politicians and executives were put behind bars. The corruption scandal also reached Europe and Africa. The US Department of Justice called it “the largest foreign bribery case in history”. It was so huge that when Maluf was finally arrested in 2017, nobody batted an eyelid.Such corruption is not just a theft of tax revenue, it is a motivation for environmental crime: billions of tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere for projects of dubious social value and often pushed through – as in the case of Belo Monte – against the opposition of affected local residents and with deep concerns among environmental licensing authorities.Chatham House predicts urbanisation, population growth and economic development will push global cement production from 4 to 5bn tonnes a year. If developing countries expand their infrastructure to current average global levels, the construction sector will emit 470 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.The dangers are recognised. A report last year by Chatham House calls for a rethink in the way cement is produced. To reduce emissions, it urges greater use of renewables in production, improved energy efficiency, more substitutes for clinker and, most important, the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology – though this is expensive and has not yet been deployed in the industry on a commercial scale.Architects believe the answer is to make buildings leaner and, when possible, to use other materials, such as cross-laminated timber. It is time to move out of the “concrete age” and stop thinking primarily about how a building looks, said Anthony Thistleton.“Concrete is beautiful and versatile but, unfortunately, it ticks all the boxes in terms of environmental degradation,” he told the Architects Journal. “We have a responsibility to think about all the materials we are using and their wider impact.”But many engineers argue that there is no viable alternative. Steel, asphalt and plasterboard are more energy intensive than concrete. The world’s forests are already being depleted at an alarming rate even without a surge in extra demand for timber.Phil Purnell, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, said the world was unlikely to reach a “peak concrete” moment.“The raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation,” he said. “By almost any measure it’s the least energy-hungry of all materials.”Instead, he calls for existing structures to be better maintained and conserved, and, when that is not possible, to enhance recycling. Currently most concrete goes to landfill sites or is crushed and reused as aggregate. This could be done more efficiently, Purnell said, if slabs were embedded with identification tags that would allow the material to be matched with demand. His colleagues at Leeds University are also exploring alternatives to Portland cement. Different mixes can reduce the carbon footprint of a binder by up to two-thirds, they say.Arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature-based cultures with data-driven economies. That requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete, and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity.

A lot has happened since: Moonlight memorably won the best picture Oscar two years ago Mahershala Ali and Viola Davis have won supporting actor prizes and Jordan Peele has a best original screenplay gong. Alongside them, several other black artists have been nominated.But the OscarsSoWhite campaign was not meant merely as a tick-box exercise in counting the number of nominations. It was meant to make Hollywood rethink how it tells black people’s stories, and to reward black artists in the best possible way – by giving them the chance to have their voices heard.So it feels like a major step backwards that this year Hollywood gave its most prestigious Oscar – best picture – to a nostalgic tale of a racist white driver somehow “saved” by his black passenger. Though the driver (Tony Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen) is a former bouncer, and the passenger (Don Shirley, played by Ali) a concert pianist, it’s Mortensen who is centre-stage, and received a nomination for best actor. Though Ali did win an Oscar, it was in the supporting actor category. The movie is written by Vallelonga’s real-life son and the award was accepted on stage by its white-dominated producers.The movie, set in the early 1960s, much of it in the racially segregated southern states, fits almost perfectly into the Hollywood template. That is, black movies should be set a long time in the past, when things were really bad for black folk, so the audience can leave with a nice warm feeling: “Haven’t we come a long way? Aren’t we doing so well today?”Their enduring message is that racism is all about bigots who beat up black people and shout “nigger”. Everyone who doesn’t do that is some kind of woke hero. There’s never any lesson for modern audiences on how they may be perpetuating racism, or be blind to its subtleties. For Green Book read: Selma, Fences, Loving. Even the more enlightened movies (Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk) can leave the audience feeling, “Gee, it must be miserable being black!”That’s why it was so great to see Peele’s Get Out break the mould in 2017 (the white girlfriend’s creepy white friends all told the central black character, “You know, I voted for Obama”). Building on this, last year’s standout movie was Black Panther. Its celebration of black culture, and African-ness, has catapulted the spirit of Wakanda through the black diaspora.Above all, what makes Green Book such a bad choice is that it’s a full 30 years since its road trip predecessor, Driving Miss Daisy, scooped the best picture Oscar. That similarly saccharine take on racism – this time using a white passenger and black driver – at least had the excuse that the world was far more ignorant then. Does Hollywood really consider a crude re-run the best it can do? It sends a message that, three decades on, it has learned nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60efcaa55d6b1e2c5de4913a140031552bc59183/0_21_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad22e6bc562ab60db396fa970312bac5","title":"labour brexit jeremy corbyn public vote remain","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has at last promised a public vote. He needs to campaign hard for the significant majority who want to remainSliding closer day by day, you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no-deal smash-out. Into the unknown! Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor! Break all rules, start again, bring on the Brexit revolution!They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, cautioned them on Monday: “We are sleep-walking into no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you. Wake up. This is real.” European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a “chaotic Brexit”, the grown-ups trying to restrain the out-of-control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government. Since there can’t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement, Tusk says: “It’s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal.” So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge, at serious risk of an accidental last-minute plunge.Sniff the air and you can sense among some a dangerous appetite for chaos, a ghoulish curiosity to see what no-deal would do. Naturally, Tory extremists and Ukippers eagerly anticipate the anarchy of their low-tax, roll-back-the-state, free-trading brave new world. But among some of the Labour leader’s allies, especially the Unite coterie, you could sometimes sniff it too – that old revolutionary taste for the sound of breaking glass: out of chaos, a new dawn. The worse the national disaster, the more certain that the Tories will be rendered unelectable for a generation. Mercifully, Jeremy Corbyn has swerved away from that with his promise of a “public vote”. Sometimes there’s a hint of longing for revenge among the angriest remainers. Let the right face the full horror of a no-deal Brexit: a crash-out would expose their referendum lies. Watch them squirm to explain empty-shelf food riots and deaths from medical shortages as a price worth paying for British nationalist fantasies. How else will Britain finally learn the value of European comradeship? You see the temptation – but national shame rarely leads to a better political climate.Mercifully, most MPs are not no-dealers and will try their damnedest to prevent crashing out. On Wednesday Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin are set to take on the battle to rule out no deal, with an amendment giving parliament a vote to delay withdrawal if Theresa May fails to win a deal by 13 March. With a Labour whip behind it, it should pass, with many fewer Labour rebels this time. Faced with a choice of an unprecedented rebellion inside her government, May looks ready to offer her own promise of a two-month delay if her deal fails. Will that buy off her rebels? It surely shouldn’t, only inching us two months away from a no-deal abyss.So, after an excruciatingly lengthy wait, here at last is backing for a new referendum from Corbyn. He will put up a Labour soft Brexit motion – likely to fail – but then he will need to back Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson’s amendment, which is the cleverest escape from this impasse. It would nod through May’s deal on 12 March – but only in exchange for letting voters confirm this is indeed their will. There is a better chance this one could win cross-party support if, on 12 March, it’s the last chance of saving the country from leaving with no deal.The defection of eight Labour MPs to the Independent Group seems to have had a big effect, breaking the obstinacy of the leadership team. Today the pressure mounted further, with deputy leader Tom Watson talking of setting up a social democratic grouping, and Momentum’s chair, Jon Lansman, openly criticising the leadership over antisemitism. It seems to have finally jolted Corbyn into action. A deepening ide between shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Corbyn over a range of issues has been brewing, but failure to back the KyleWilson plan would be the breaking point for many in Labour, with frontbenchers among those poised to resign. MPs have shown me an avalanche of emails from local party members resigning over Corbyn’s Brexit feebleness. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has been the hero of this long march to a sane outcome, soldiering on, pushing, pulling, persuading his leader, as Labour supporters began to suspect Corbyn was himself a Brexiteer. From now on, Labour’s over-riding mission is to do all it can to prevent any kind of Brexit, and let voters decide.They want Brexit done and dusted now.But when it is explained that after leaving, still longer and more complex trade negotiations lie ahead, that, says Cooper, “brings focus groups to horrified silence”. Leavers and remainers say they had no idea how difficult leaving would be: none of us did. Where do voters stand now? Few switch sides, but the switchers all move towards remain. Those who didn’t vote but would do so next time break 3:1 for remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7077c0833ee3fb14a2cd12b8f99a1a7aa0ea1ae1/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9db12c7cd500108d0edc336352c2ea2 465w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

On HBO’s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver looked into a less headline-worthy stream of scams: psychics, particularly on daytime TV.Oliver was adamant that his segment would not interrogate whether or not psychics are “real” – “For one, they’re not,” he panned. And while it’s easy to dismiss psychics (“fun, too”), Oliver argued that it’s foolhardy to ignore their influence in America according to the Pew Research Center, four in 10 Americans believe in them. “Statistically, that means that out of all the people who saw John Travolta’s Gotti movie, four of them are psychics,” Oliver said.It’s not a surprise, then, that psychics have built a multimillion-dollar industry that is “larger and grimmer” than one might assume, propped up by daytime TV shows and pseudoscience.Oliver admitted that mediums, or people who claim to communicate with the dead, do make “compelling TV”. But while “watching people tear up can seem incredible, the techniques that psychics use to achieve those moments are significantly less incredible”.Oliver looked into two main methods: cold reading and hot reading. Cold reading involves narrowing high probability guesses into a broad, generalizing claim. “It’s like asking a room full of praying mantises: ‘Has anybody here lost a loved one because you ate them after having sex?’” Oliver explained. “You know that all those little green hands are going up.”The secret is that “the broader the generality, the higher the chance it resonates with someone” – basically, it’s “a magic trick, and yet prominent, smart people are willing to cosign on psychics’ abilities”.For example, Oliver turned to a Today show clip from a couple years ago, in which Matt Lauer expressed amazement at Hollywood Medium’s Tyler Henry’s “vision” of fishing with his dad.“Look, maybe Tyler Henry genuinely accessed the afterlife, an action which would fundamentally change our understanding of everything on earth,” Oliver said following a clip of Lauer telling a similar vision to Larry King years before. “Or maybe he just googled ‘Matt Lauer Dad’ and hit the fucking jackpot”.That technique – guessing with research – is known as hot reading. But whatever the method, Lauer fell for it.“You can see why people are vulnerable to psychics,” Oliver conceded. “A message from a lost loved one is something many people in the midst of grief would do anything for.” However, though psychics may think they offer a harmless coping mechanism for grief, “at best, it is reckless for a stranger to take a stab at ventriloquizing the dead. Loss is complicated, and mourning doesn’t look the same for everyone,” Oliver said.“But at worst, when psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services,” he continued. Even worse, “TV actively enables this ghoulishness” by granting psychics an air of validity in questionable or damaging circumstances Oliver used the example of Amanda Berry, a kidnapped girl who watched, in captivity, as a psychic on a daytime talkshow told Berry’s mom that she was dead.Oliver argued that the host, Montel Williams, deserved some blame in this mess: “If Oprah interviewed a live alligator and it ate four members of her audience, I’d be angry with the alligator, but I’d also be kinda angry with Oprah.”In sum, Oliver said, we should be wary of how pop culture validates psychics, because “every time a psychic makes a grieving widow cry on Dr Oz, 10 con artists get their wings”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3664100f1b958f377d58ad25940abc5645ddb8/45_467_2781_1670/master/2781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b07740fa72ebf702a38aec1ace3b8b","title":"oscars red carpet 2019 in pictures from glenn close to regina king","story":"A selection of the most striking red carpet looks from the 91st Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfeac5454b1940f2c05fa4926d48898caefb448f/629_155_3089_1854/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa5fe3764517d11115cd66dbcf481267","title":"apollo 11 review eye opening documentary is a five star triumph","story":"An exceptional, vibrant restoration of never-before-seen footage results in one of the most astounding films about space ever made The documentary Apollo 11 starts, as the famous mission did, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Trucks ferry massive rocket props, machinery grinds as it would in any construction zone, the sky is a crystal blue. The scene is, in a word, vibrant – so startlingly alive that for the first few minutes, I wasn’t sure if I was watching footage from 1969 or a Nasa promo shot from last year.That present-ness is one of the film’s major feats, credit due to director Todd Douglas Miller, who has found a brilliant way to portray the first moon landing by doing nothing more than the gargantuan task of faithfully rejuvenating the historical record. The documentary is seamless curation of archival work Miller and his team, in partnership with Nasa and the National Archives, sifted through 11,000 hours of uncatalogued audio and restored reams of original film, including hyper-detail 70mm footage that languished in the archives, boxed up and forgotten, since 1969. The result is a stunning project of historical preservation – no narration, no cutaway interviews, no recreations, just original material synced with some music and the occasional diagram.Apollo 11 arrives early in the mission’s 50th anniversary year, which means the significance of the nation’s space program, from JFK’s promise to put a man on the moon to the famous television broadcast of Neil Armstrong’s first steps, will be under review. Already, the Apollo missions have proved fertile territory for filmmakers Damien Chazelle’s Armstrong biopic, First Man, offered a deeply studied take on the astronaut and his time in space, while documentaries such as Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo combined archives with present-day interviews. Both set a steep goal of bringing an event so entrenched and replicated in the American cultural lexicon to life so it’s a bit ironic that the filmmakers of the all-archive Apollo 11, who step so far back in 1969 as to be nearly invisible, achieve it.The 93-minute film is anchored by four pivotal moments in the Apollo 11 mission: lift-off, landing the Eagle rover on the moon, reconnecting Eagle with the Columbia spacecraft to return home, and re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. We already know the outcome of these risks, and yet the sequences are still mesmerizing. With a score that ranges from swelling orchestra to a single thump, thump, thump of a heartbeat, coupled with stitches of headset and Mission Control recordings, the movie’s technical spacecraft scenes are less suspense baits than genuinely moving, hypnotic odes to teamwork.The film’s emotional power, however, comes not in the documentation of astronauts in space (though that is, of course, undeniably arresting, even half a century on), but in the absolutely incredible footage of the crowds who watched the launch from Earth. Miller’s team meticulously restored wide-lens footage, taken by Nasa’s team on the morning of 16 July, of the nearly 1 million people who gathered on the shores of Florida to watch the take-off the result is a luminous portal into another, more bouffanted America, one far away, with its old cars and outdated Penney’s logo, but with familiar parking lot parties.The Apollo 11 mission looms so large in American lore – “one small step for man,” you can fill in the rest – that it seems like a tremendous act of respect on behalf of the film-makers to ground the nine-day mission in its quotidian, idiosyncratic, and sometimes (in the case of the astronauts’ press tour) hammy moments. Apollo 11 juxtaposes massive feats of scale – groundbreaking engineering, built with thousands of minds in cooperation – with mid-century modern ketchup packets and outdated bathing caps. That Miller’s film allows you, without commentary, to make meaning of these contrasts — the whole of Earth in one shot, a parking lot PB\u0026ampJ snack shack in another – feels like a radical act of trust.I keep waiting to find a fault with Apollo 11, as I usually have to do with things I love at first glance. And while there are legitimate criticisms of America’s space program, it’s hard to argue with a film that defers so humbly to the primary source material. There’s a deep pleasure, especially now, in immersive historical voyeurism, in the illusion that we can transcend the limitations of our own time and understand another collective experience. And there’s something deeply kind in letting the archives stand on their own, of giving the evidence we have of what happened in July 1969 the space to breathe. Perhaps it’s that space – a record of people and incredulity and intense focus, without talking heads or hyperbole – that’s the great humanizing force of Apollo 11."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ca2bdd5d4b86e247cc88eca3ee9fcaa376c11c/0_111_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6efd00121e96bc90c5b7ecf1957b773","title":"lets do the right thing how spike lee became hollywoods political conscience","story":"The BlacKkKlansman director missed out on the best picture Oscar, but with US politics more ided than ever he remains the fearless voice the industry needs‘What’s Spike Lee going to have to say about this?” That was the first question on many minds after the initial shock of Green Book winning the best picture Oscar. We were just waiting for a reaction shot of Lee, applauding resignedly at history repeating itself. It was nearly 30 years ago that Lee was in a similar situation, when the anodyne, feelgood civil rights film Driving Miss Daisy won best picture, while Lee’s exhilarating Do the Right Thing went home empty-handed. Green Book was this year’s Driving Miss Daisy. While Lee’s considerably more confrontational BlacKkKlansman – also nominated for best picture – didn’t go home empty-handed, it must have felt like insult added to injury. According to the reporter Andrew Dalton, Lee was “visibly angry” at the announcement, “waving his arms in disgust and appearing to try to storm out of the Dolby theatre before he was stopped at the doors”.Ironically, at first glance, Green Book and BlacKkKlansman have much in common. Both are set in the recent past and tackle US racism via a reluctant friendship between a black man and a white man. But where Green Book falls firmly into the category you could call “Isn’t it great how we’re not as racist as we used to be” movies, BlacKkKlansman concludes the opposite. Its sting-in-the-tail coda – footage from the 2017 white-nationalist march in Charlottesville, North Carolina, cheered on by the Ku Klux Klan – is a reminder that the US is every bit as racist as it used to be. Green Book finished with a wishful, small-scale racial truce BlacKkKlansman delivered a harder, less convenient truth.At the awards ceremony, Lee served a similar function to his movie. This time, at least, he received the Oscar for best adapted screenplay – and used his acceptance speech to inject a dose of bubble-bursting realism into a ceremony that seemed hell-bent on eradicating it. Lee invoked Black History Month, the genocide of Native Americans and the 400th anniversary of his ancestors arriving on American shores, “stolen from mother Africa and brought to Jamestown, Virginia”. He ended on an unambiguously current note: “The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilise, let’s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right thing!” Inevitably, Donald Trump tweeted back, complaining about Lee’s “racist hit on your president” and listing his own (self-identified) achievements for African Americans, as if there were any question over whose word African-American voters would trust more.Lee was not quite a lone voice in referencing politics at the Oscars, even if others did it more obliquely. Javier Bardem mentioned walls and borders (in Spanish) when presenting best foreign film to Alfonso Cuarón, for example, while Rami Malek spoke of his own and Freddie Mercury’s immigrant backgrounds. But the memo for this year’s Oscars seemed to read: “Political correctness: fine actual politics: no, thanks.” In an Academy more hesitant than ever about what it is supposed to do or be, politics is now seen as a ratings loser. This is especially true after 2018’s ceremony, in which the presenter, Jimmy Kimmel, and various award-winners spoke directly about racism, gun control, sexual abuse, women’s rights, immigration and, of course, Trump. The conservative media – Trump included – were quick to equate the 2018 ceremony’s all-time-high political slant with its all-time-low television ratings. Anyone sticking their head above the parapet nowadays risks being labelled a pampered Hollywood liberal or a posturing bandwagon-jumper – everyone except Lee. Now more than ever, he looks and sounds like Hollywood’s political conscience.Lee has always spoken out and never cared about the consequences. In the course of his career, on screen and off, he has denounced all manner of injustices, including police violence, gun control, Hollywood racism (witness his use of DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation in BlacKkKlansman), African-American self-caricature (he has a long-running spat with Tyler “Madea” Perry), and lack of representation within the industry.In 2015, while receiving an honorary Oscar at the Governors’ awards at the height of the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Lee told his audience of Hollywood heavyweights: “Everybody in here probably voted for Obama, but when I go to offices I don’t see no black folks except for the brother man at the security.” The industry needed to have a serious conversation about ersity, he warned. “You better get smart, because your workforce should reflect what this country looks like.”If the Academy thought they had brought Lee on side with the honorary gong, for his contributions to film-making, they were mistaken: Lee went on to boycott the Oscar ceremony proper a few months later, in protest at the lack of African-American nominees. In an open letter, Lee acknowledged his spokesman status, pointing out how his opinions were always sought when it came to Hollywood’s failings. “For too many years, when the Oscar nominations are revealed, my office phone rings off the hook with the media asking my opinion about the lack of African Americans,” he wrote. He advised people to ask the white nominees and studio heads instead.But in the absence of outspoken Hollywood figures, it has never mattered more what Lee has to say. After all this time, he has an authority and standing that few can match. His words matter – and he knows it. Yet you never feel as if Lee is auditioning for a political role or seeking publicity for its own sake (that said, respect for that purple, Prince-homaging outfit). It is more the opposite: Lee will speak his mind even when he knows he shouldn’t.He did exactly that at the post-ceremony press conference, taking questions while admitting he was on his sixth glass of champagne. When someone asked his feelings about Green Book, he took several more swigs from his glass before answering. “Every time somebody’s driving somebody, I lose,” he joked, referencing Driving Miss Daisy.But then, as always, Lee got real. He talked about Heather Heyer, the protester killed at Charlottesville, whose death is featured in the closing moments of BlacKkKlansman. “Her murder was an American terrorist act … and when the president of the United States did not refute, did not denounce the Klan, the alt-right and neo-Nazis … whether we won best picture or not, this film will stand the test of time, being on the right side of history.”It was the second time that evening he used the expression. Throughout his career, Lee has variously been ignored, condemned and ostracised as much as he has been supported, applauded and admired. There is little doubt he is on the right side of history – and that is more important than any award."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e0292b3499db48d8347526644e5b82df9643d31/0_75_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e756bb7bfe4608b483de7f96e517370","title":"marie kondo megastars and masturbatory congratulation my night at the oscars","story":"Twelve months of bewildering screw-ups from the Academy has left the show looking shaky – and even the Vanity Fair party might be on its way outThe question was not: would the Oscars be bad this year? For the past six months, and in particular the past six weeks, the question was: would this year’s Oscars be so butt-clenchingly, fist-gnawingly, eye-rollingly, hair-tearingly bad that the whole shebang would have to be burned in a garbage fire of shame?Unlike the Chinese, the Oscars has always foolishly resisted naming its inidual years, leaving their distinguishing signifiers to be decided by the merciless press and public. Thus, the 2012 Oscars was the Year of Angelina’s Leg. The 2006 Oscars was the Year Crash Beat Brokeback (which was widely deemed to be the worst-ever best film decision – until this Sunday night). The 2017 Oscars – well, let’s just say “envelope” and leave it there.Even before the year started, 2019 looked like it was the Year of Oscars’ Nervous Breakdown. Let’s have a quick recap of the Academy Awards’ bewildering screw-ups over the past 12 months, shall we? First, in an attempt to stop the decline in TV ratings, the Academy announced it was introducing a new category, best popular film, then it announced that it wasn’t. Then it announced Kevin Hart was hosting, then it announced he wasn’t. Then it said the winners of some categories would not be announced on TV, then it decided against that, too. Those of us who were outraged that Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book were nominated for best film instead of the indescribably superior Leave No Trace and You Were Never Really Here (both ignored by the Academy and both, coincidentally, or maybe not, directed by women), consoled ourselves with the thought that the Academy would probably reverse ferret on that, too, possibly mid-ceremony.It wasn’t just the Oscars that were over, but everything around them, too. The Vanity Fair party, for so long the night’s golden ticket, was deemed last week to be “past its prime” by the New York Times. It had become, the article alleged, a bloated, overly corporate, anachronistic warhorse that allowed in – good God! – “civilians”. Vanity Fair, it has to be said, did not help itself by giving the NYT such quotes as: “We’re finding additional media opportunities we can monetise that come out of the party.” (Woo hoo, party on!) Instead, the coolest Oscars’ night’s parties are now deemed to be the ones hosted by actual celebrities, such as Madonna’s long-running one and Jay-Z’s new upstart. Proving that it may be passé, but can still muster up A-list-level huffiness, Vanity Fair reportedly disinvited the NYT’s reporter.Salting the wound, US Vogue’s March issue is, the cover declared, a celebration of how California became “the centre of everything”, from art to fertility treatments. One industry that barely gets a mention, however, is movies, with a pop star (Justin Bieber) and model (Hailey Baldwin) given the cover. Inside, a fashion shoot celebrating “a new generation of Hollywood talents” stars Kendall Jenner, suggesting that the only screen stars that matter these days are the ones on Instagram. And given Jenner has a jaw-dropping 104 million followers on Instagram – four times the number of people who watched the Oscars last year – maybe that’s true.Apologies for the obvious point, but Vanity Fair and the Oscars are facing the same problem, which is a changing media world. Of course Vanity Fair needs to monetise its party: as with nearly all magazines, its sales figures are dropping. Similarly, the Oscars viewing figures have been in a death spiral for years, which is why the Academy keeps trying to jazz it up and cut the running time. And sure, these quick-fix ideas of logos and populist categories are ham-fisted and desperate, but the media ARE desperate. Then people hate these changes and then the organisations panic. As a result, neither the Oscars nor the Vanity Fair party have managed to stop their own decline or maintain their credibility. I think this is called being stuck between a rock and a flatline.To get to the Dolby theatre, which is where the Oscars is held, you have to pass a gazillion souvenir stands, all selling fantasies of Hollywood’s golden era: Marilyn Monroe masks, Alfred Hitchcock postcards. All big cities indulge in a certain amount of self-mythology, but Los Angeles’s self-love is frankly masturbatory, and never more so than on Oscars night, when viewers are repeatedly told we are witnessing the biggest night in movies with the most elite of celebrities. And yet the first person I spot in the Dolby is Marie Kondo, a woman who has forged a remarkable career for herself by simply telling people to throw out their crap. Just to emphasise how much the world has changed from the days of Monroe and Hitchcock, Kondo turns out to be the most elite person I meet all night, because she is forbidden from talking to anyone. “She’s here with Access Hollywood so she can’t give quotes. But you can have a selfie,” her translator explains.Helen Mirren, happily, can give quotes when I find her in the theatre atrium. Does she think the Oscars are dunzo? “It’s always been a wonderful, lumbering elephant. Maybe it has got too big and not interesting to audiences, but it matters to film-makers, you see?” she says, looking as serious as a woman can look while wearing head-to-toe hot pink.So which Oscars party is cool enough for Mirren? “Parties? Oh no, I’m going home to get in my jimjams,” she hoots, trailing off into the auditorium.By this point, I’ve been hanging out in the atrium for two hours and no one who has passed – Glenn Close, Regina King, Jordan Peele – has caused too much of a stir. But suddenly there is a palpable thrill in the air and I turn around to see why: it’s Chadwick Boseman and Michael B Jordan, arriving simultaneously and high fiving one another, to the delight of a million camera phones. So excited is everyone by the Black Panther guys that they don’t even notice the person skulking in behind them, who happens to be Daniel Craig. Sorry, James Bond, but there are new movie heroes in town.When the Academy mooted the idea of a best popular film category, it was widely (but not entirely) derided as a way to give Black Panther a big award without having to give it the biggest award. Given what did actually get the biggest award on Sunday night (we’ll get to that in a tick), I wonder if people still feel quite so down on the popular film idea, especially given Black Panther’s obvious popularity. No other film was applauded quite so enthusiastically as Black Panther in the auditorium, with people leaping to their feet every time it got a trophy. Which brings me to the biggest change of the night.Before the Oscars, I had thought that, if it felt different from usual, it would be because (for the first time in decades) it didn’t have a host. And yes, that did give the ceremony a disjointed feel, while also helping it to clip along at a nice speed. But, in fact, the biggest change was how how un-white and un-male it was. Women swept the documentary categories (“I can’t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar!” shouted Raykha Zehtabchi, director of Period. End of Sentence) as well as best animated short (“To all the nerdy girls out there who hide behind your sketchbooks, don’t be afraid to tell your story,” Bao’s director, Domee Shi, said in her speech). Olivia Colman gave, unquestionably, the speech of the night, while Lady Gaga definitively disproved A Star Is Born’s weird implication to the contrary and showed she truly is the talented one of her and Bradley Cooper when they performed Shallow together.Both supporting Oscars went to black actors (Regina King and Mahershala Ali), making Ali the first black man to get two supporting Oscars. Spike Lee finally got his dues, if not enough of them. And while Rami Malek’s best actor Oscar was clearly ludicrous, there was compensation to be found in the thought that he’s the first Arab-American to win that award, even if he made as much of an acknowledgement of this as he did of the Aids crisis that killed Freddie Mercury, which is to say barely any at all. A Mexican director got best director for the fifth time in six years. The 2019 Oscars looked something close to modern and I briefly wondered whether the event might modernise itself naturally and thereby broaden its appeal without clumsy interventions from the Academy. But then Green Book – a movie that thinks it’s easier to cure racism than snobbery – won best picture, reminding us all that the Oscars won’t evolve without a fight.Over at the Vanity Fair party, which used to be styled to look like a cosy private club, but is now so big it feels like being in an impossibly crowded airport hangar, the first person I see is Instagram star and “joke curator”, Josh Ostrovsky, AKA the Fat Jew. Oh we’re hanging with the A-list now, babycakes. It feels cruel to tease the Vanity Fair party, which I suspect is only getting a kicking now because its glitzy former editor, Graydon Carter, is gone and it’s run by the much lower-key Radhika Jones. And, no question, it can still pull in the celebrities: in one casual glance I see Paul Rudd, Adam Driver and Mark Ronson. But whereas it used to feel like walking through Madame Tussaud’s, with every face a famous one, it now just feels like being at a big corporate party, with executives (and maybe even civilians!) massively outnumbering the stars.“It feels like being in an aquarium,” the comedian John Mulaney tells me, before quickly adding: “But one full of very nice people.”I spot Marilyn Manson sitting on a sofa, looking utterly bemused by the scene in front of him. “It’s the first time I’ve been. I’ve come as Adrien Brody’s plus one, and it’s a good party, I guess. But I’m looking forward to going,” he says.A friend of his comes over. “You going to Madonna’s party or Jay-Z’s?” the friend asks.“Maybe Madonna? You ready to go?” Manson replies.At that point, I get a text from a friend, also on the Oscars party circuit: “The Netflix party is great! Barry Jenkins and Alfonso Cuarón are here and we’re all dancing!” Another friend at the Fox party reports that it’s “fantastic”.Instead of there being one big party where all the stars congregate, the Oscars party scene has atomised into lots of little parties, reflecting the media. We don’t all watch the same shows at primetime: some of us will watch Netflix, some will watch Fox and someone, somewhere, will read Vanity Fair. Times have changed.On my way out, I pass Jordan again. Did he enjoy the parties? He smiles like the megastar he knows himself to be. “I’m sorry, I’m not talking to the press tonight,” he says. Just as I’m about to walk away, he holds eye contact while solemnly placing his hand on my pregnant stomach. “But I want to wish you congratulations.”And with the blessing of Wakanda on the next generation, this Oscars year officially comes to a close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4974bef32edf505e1935fe8f856dd2cd0f72776c/0_30_1287_772/master/1287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f41e91b962825ca94f9bbd6071ab766","title":"oscars 2019 green book olivia colman the favourite alfonso cuaron","story":"The Academy voters got it right with gongs for Olivia Colman and Alfonso Cuarón, but Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody have been sorely overratedIn the end, there was enough good news – or news that made a certain sort of sense – for this not to be simply another exasperating Academy Awards pageant of mysteriously over-promoted nonsense. Olivia Colman already had the title of queen of all our hearts, and, just when it looked as if Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite was going to go home with nothing at all, Colman added the Academy Award to her bulging silverware cabinet – and of course gave a speech of great charm and grace.Her prize acceptance game this year has been off the chart: stylish, polished and with just enough pinch-me-I’m-dreaming astonishment to rival Helen Mirren’s triumphal awards season tour of 2007, when she was winning everything for her own queenly performance. Colman (Anne), Mirren (Elizabeth II), Dench (Elizabeth I) … Brits in crowns generally do it for the Academy.And there was justice in seeing Alfonso Cuarón picking up the best director, best cinematography and best foreign language Oscars for his magnificent artwork Roma. I have no problem with Spike Lee and his co-writers David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Willmott picking up the award for best adapted screenplay for their fierce satire BlacKkKlansman. (Although I think I might have preferred to see Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty get it for Can You Ever Forgive Me?) The 2019 Oscar prize list was speckled with honourable wins.Green Book isn’t a bad film, and it is possible to overindulge one’s high cinephile disdain. Mahershala Ali (winner for best supporting actor) and Viggo Mortensen give very slick and technically accomplished performances as the African-American jazz musician and composer Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga, the Italian-American nightclub bouncer who finds himself driving Shirley through a tricky tour of the 1960s deep south. Ali’s performance is extremely elegant: he has the command and address of a classical actor in a classical role. But – to quote another of the night’s winners – this really is shallow stuff, which in another, sterner universe would be straight-to-video. Its well-intentioned whiteblack balance is glib.The other truly mystifying triumph this year is Bohemian Rhapsody, the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen, a project clouded by the association with its disgraced director Bryan Singer. Whatever else might be wrong with this film, it isn’t Rami Malek’s likable, spirited and now Oscar-winning performance: the impersonation of Mercury that he carried off with great elan. However, it has to be said that he wasn’t as good as the other four nominees: Christian Bale in Vice, Bradley Cooper in A Star Is Born, Willem Dafoe in At Eternity’s Gate and indeed Viggo Mortensen in Green Book.But for this moderate film to have been such a big winner, even picking up the Oscar for editing (as well as sound editing and sound mixing), really seems very silly. As with Green Book, it feels as if the Academy has reached into the bargain bin just by the till, and capriciously plucked out a couple of also-rans for glory.It was great to see Regina King win best supporting actress for her delicate, luminously intelligent performance in Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk. Here is where the awards’ hive-mind consensus has got it right, and her success makes up a little for the way this excellent film was overlooked this year.There was a time when we thought that Bradley Cooper’s version of A Star Is Born might win big. It is an excellent movie, which deserved an awful lot more than just the best song award – although the steamily passionate live performance that Lady Gaga and Cooper gave of Shallow tonight earned them the scene-stealer title and created a Twitter gagstorm about how their respective partners must be feeling.Elsewhere, it is difficult to question the resounding best animation win for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a brilliant film that future generations of cinephiles will be treasuring long after BoRhap has been forgotten. And there was a best documentary Oscar for the truly gasp-inducing Free Solo. It was good to see Hannah Beachler and Jay Hart win best production design for their amazing work on Black Panther.As ever, we have to hope that great movies such as Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, Lucrecia Martel’s Zama, and Lee Chang-dong’s Burning will survive their hurtful snubs, and concentrate on the success of Roma – although even here I have a twinge that Cold War, directed by Paweł Pawlikowski and produced by Tanya Seghatchian, did not get the moment of glory that it deserved.Yet Roma is a wonderful film, a thrilling journey into the past, all but defying gravity in its staggering set pieces and crowd-scene choreography with profoundly mysterious and moving moments. It is superbly acted, unbearably moving and visually electrifying. It is the evening’s real winner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6840639df619ab2a540f03ddfe82499fb192e2b9/158_288_1102_661/master/1102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b38b449670a8d1cb2a0bb9290a076b0","title":"oscars diary black sheep hollywood glamour","story":"The star of the ’s Oscar-nominated documentary short Black Sheep recounts his whirlwind week in TinseltownWe landed yesterday, but today was the first proper day of Oscar activities, with a screening of Black Sheep for Academy voters at the Museum of Tolerance in Beverly Hills. The MoT is an LA institution dedicated to raising awareness of discrimination and attracts a liberal older audience who love to ask questions. They surrounded us afterwards, many wanting to check that I was OK now. The film is about a time in my life 15 years ago when I moved to an estate in Essex to escape racism and violence and found even more of it out there. I’m a film-maker myself but when I met the director, Ed Perkins, we decided it was better to make a documentary where I could tell my story straight to camera.When people come up to me after screenings, they seem to need that confirmation that, after the upset the last 27 minutes on screen has provoked in them, everything is alright now. People’s reactions to the film can be intense.The screenings are strange events – you’re campaigning for votes, but not really allowed to say you are: you have to stay coy and cool. Voting ends tomorrow, and then maybe we can relax a bit.Tomorrow’s highlight will be meeting up with the fashion designer Ozwald Boateng to get my Oscars suit. This is the kind of unexpected thing that being nominated gets you.Tonight our team attended the official Oscars documentary event where each team of documentary nominees across features and shorts gets five minutes to talk about their film and show a clip from it. Ed and producer Jonathan were first up.This is when the reality of being nominated really hits, with a sudden deluge of glamour and prompting thoughts of who you want to meet. I’m hoping I’ll meet Spike Lee. Apparently he knows about the film.Documentaries aren’t glamorous, they’re often hard grinds. Yet this very personal story is now the reason behind a whirlwind of attention for me. Cameras are being shoved in my face and I’m being asked questions like “What do you want to get out of this week?” The honest answer is to have a bit of a break, eat some good food, have some fun and meet some new people. That didn’t seem to be the answer the camera people wanted … they’d have preferred me to shout: “TO WIN!”We took a lot of photos with giant statues of the gold Oscar man, pulling a variety of silly (and occasionally serious) faces. There’s something strange about seeing the iconic figure up close. His kitschy pose is everywhere and the more you look at it, especially on gigantic replica statues, the weirder it seems. We tried to mimic his pose – you just can’t get it right.A quieter day that meant me my girlfriend, who’s here from Canada, could look for some of LA’s best Nigerian food. This is a hiatus period between the end of voting and all the bigger pre-ceremony glitz. You hear about the big gifting parties, where stars are offered absurd free things and vouchers for beauty services … but those companies aren’t so interested in the short documentary nominees. But we want to find a way to get some free Hollywood swag, it feels like it should be part of the Oscars experience.It was a grey day and felt like the glamour had gone away for a bit after the excitement of last night. But in the evening, we did a screening at Soho House on the Sunset Strip and got an amazing view of LA from up high. As usual, the Q\u0026ampA after felt emotionally intense. We were asked a lot of questions about what the film says about the state of Britain, which is a lot to ask about something that’s just my own personal story. Reliving this hard experience over and over again in such short succession is really hard.We talked about how the ceremony would work and realise we didn’t know who was sitting where. Then we went to the party for all the shorts nominees in a little bar. It was intimate, and a good way to speak to some non-documentary people.We know the big parties have started now because we keep reading about them – but how you get invited when you’re in one of the smallest categories is another question. Polite requests to party organisers are met with a firm rebuke: no, the lists closed weeks ago. Lady Gaga probably doesn’t have this trouble. But we’ve decided not to lose any sleep over it – it’s nice hanging out with each other. I’m just grateful for the experience of being here.Some of our group hiked up to see the Hollywood sign, although it being one of the coldest weeks for decades in LA, no one wants to linger too long. It’s jumpers and big coats for us – not what we signed up for. The evening was a relaxed one away from the Oscars buzz, although our publicist explained a few little details: who gets to go on which red carpet on the day. You imagine it’s one long route for everyone, but it’s not – those who get to set foot on the main drag in front of the paparazzi need to justify their presence and get out the way as quickly as possible before the big stars arrive. Apparently me and the director and producer will get to go on the main red carpet. They say you can’t take your own photo and video on the red carpet, but I bet you can.We had a first sense of what an Oscar nomination can get you – in a restaurant some of our group were visiting, we were told there were no free tables. When we mention the nomination, one mysteriously opened up.Today we got to hang out with the British consul, a man who lives in a big house straight out of the Fresh Prince and whose job is to promote British film in Hollywood. He was celebrating the British nominees, accompanied by strong gin cocktails, small sandwiches and scones. Richard E Grant popped in briefly, and some of the craft nominees from The Favourite, Bohemian Rhapsody and Mary Queen of Scots were there – and it was finally a bit warmer. I met one of the producers of The Favourite and the man who set up the documentary voting branch of the Oscars.Everyone seemed to have heard of Black Sheep and they seemed impressed that it wasn’t just the director and producer in our team who were present, but also the person whose story was being told. Apparently some documentary film-makers don’t even thank their subjects when they talk about their films, which seems weird to me.We got some good tips for the ceremony: take snacks, because you won’t get a proper meal, and prepare to be cold in the air-conditioned room designed to keep people awake. We were also touched that on our way to the event, ITV News released a story including an interview with Damilola Taylor’s Dad, Richard, saying how much he wanted us to win. We hope we’ll do right by him.The day started with one item of exciting if bizarre “swag” - a Ruth Bader Ginsburg action doll given away at brunch. She’s not the icon for us that she is for the Americans, but people keep talking about how the documentary about her, RBG, has the momentum behind it. That and Free Solo.Today was also the last Q\u0026ampA we’ll do for a while, at the International Documentary Association DocuDay event. I’m relieved we won’t have to do this again for a while – there’s only so many times in one week you can say the same things. We were on the panel with two other shorts in consideration and the Q\u0026ampA went by in a flash. We signed posters and had loads of photos taken and then realised this was the last event before tomorrow’s ceremony. It all feels so real.People keep telling us we have a good chance, but it’s almost impossible to predict with the shorts awards. Voters don’t talk very much about them, they don’t have the publicity campaigns of the longer films and they’re a lot less political. But you can get excited about the positive predictions. Whatever happens tomorrow, it’s just amazing to be here in this surreal bubble. I feel like I’ve been out here for ages and normal life has stopped. Maybe tomorrow we’ll actually get to go to hang out with some of the Hollywood legends. I never thought I’d be saying that.We didn’t win, but the experience of the Oscars isn’t something I’ll forget any time soon. It’s like nothing else I’ve ever done. After a long week of buildup when I didn’t always feel totally connected to the Oscar razzle-dazzle, suddenly comes this day of being totally part of the spectacle.My girlfriend helped me get ready in the morning, sorting the hair, sorting the jacket, making it all work. Then we met downstairs in the hotel and took a load of photos. It was a warm day and the photos we took by the pool were very Californian – we all looked transformed, like we really were part of the world of Hollywood stars. When you arrive at the Dolby Theater for the event, you feel even more like that. As soon as you get close, there’s streets closed, and when you get out the car, you’re thrown into a world of high-intensity organisation as everyone congratulates you, tells you to get moving, and pushes you towards the red carpet.The group was split straight away, with me, Ed and Jonathan going in the lane for the main red carpet and the rest of our team taken away from the press scrum. It’s a strange situation. Our publicist takes us from interview to interview in the tiered banks of hundreds of press representatives all squashed in, while crowds of members of the public sit in rows of bleachers watching us. We got there early so we were probably part of the initial disappointment before the real stars arrived.Finally, after about two hours, we were on our way into the theatre itself, and there the reality of where you are properly hits: loads of giant Oscar statues, loads of beautifully dressed people and a giant staircase taking you up to the bars and the seats. This feels like proper old-school Hollywood glamour and everyone is loving it. Celebrities are everywhere, and you’re constantly trying to figure out who these vaguely familiar faces belong to. I loved it, seeing so many of my idols around me. I spoke to Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins, who were really nice. There’s an incredible magical vibe in the room.For the ceremony itself, we were down on the ground floor, close to all the action. There’s constant ad breaks breaking up the show but it still feels like there’s a great flow to it. Our category was announced more than halfway through, so there was a lot of waiting around, but I wasn’t that nervous, it was too exciting for that. As our category approached, we were moved with the other short doc nominees to the front of the auditorium right by the stage and you really start to dream. But it wasn’t our name called pit, and we clapped for the team behind Period. End of Sentence, who made a pretty good speech.And then it’s over. But there’s no time to feel sad or disappointed because there’s the rest of the evening to enjoy - you’re whisked to the main ball and the parties full of people letting loose after the tension of the last weeks and months. Everyone scatters to different places: we had a bit of a dance, and then it’s over like a dream. It’s a shame not to win of course, but the cliche about being a winner just by being nominated is so true after this special day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

They would then be destroyed to make space.”Malcolm Hughes, then the club’s educational welfare officer, admits in a two-page statement that “some of Barry Bennell’s actions could have raised suspicions” and the chairman, John Bowler, acknowledges that Crewe did not fully appreciate the dangers of football being used as a means for a paedophile to prey on young boys.As an insight into how calculating and devious Bennell was, it transpires he was personally responsible for the appointment of Hughes – almost certainly a ploy by Bennell to make it look as though he and Crewe regarded the welfare of the children as a priority.Yet Hughes makes the candid admission that in his early years at Crewe he had only a limited understanding of safeguarding issues. “I certainly did not have the level of awareness that I currently have about the opportunities and potential for child sexual abuse and a need to monitor and check members of staff,” he writes.Bennell was branded “the devil incarnate” and “sheer evil” by a judge after being convicted last year of 50 specimen charges relating to 12 boys from the junior systems of Crewe and Manchester City from 1979 to 1991. It was his fourth prison sentence in the past 25 years and, as the  revealed in September, the man who was described in court as an “industrial-scale child molester” is also facing the possibility of another criminal trial involving nine more complainants alleging child rape. As of January last year, at least 97 people – though the number is now thought to be beyond 100 – had reported Bennell on the back of the interview Andy Woodward, the former Crewe footballer, gave to the  in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club’s youth system.As well as Gradi, Bowler, Palin and Hughes, Crewe’s then assistant academy director, Terry McPhillips, now manager of Blackpool, and the then kit-man, John Fleet, state among hundreds of pages of evidence that they had never heard any rumour, innuendo or complaints relating to Bennell.As well as his usual salary, Bennell was paid an extra £5 a night per boy in expenses to accommodate them, with up to 12 youngsters sleeping at a house he had turned into a “children’s paradise”. Bennell would show them horror films and had arcade machines, a pool table, a juke box, a monkey, two Pyrenean dogs, an Alsatian named after Zico and even a puma he had bought from Poole zoo.“The simple fact that Bennell had boys staying with him was not out of ordinary for this club,” Gradi writes. “I had (and still have on occasions) boys staying with me and indeed all my coaches have boys staying with them from time to time. One has to appreciate the nature of this club. We do not have endless resources and our boys are often brought through the ranks and stay with the club out of personal loyalty.”As one example, Gradi referenced one youth-team player, who later played for Liverpool and England, who would stay at his own house at weekends and “stayed with Crewe for many years” despite other clubs trying to tempt him away. The player in question is understood to be Danny Murphy, who joined Crewe on schoolboy terms and eventually moved to Liverpool, aged 20, for £1.5m. Crewe no longer operate this practice, in line with modern safeguarding rules.Palin would not let her own son train with Bennell, according to evidence from one witness to the FA’s ongoing inquiry, and makes it clear in a statement from November 2003 that she was uncomfortable in his presence. “I have to say that at the time I did not like him. I cannot put my finger upon what it was that caused me to dislike him. He was just one of those people who, on occasions, one takes an instantaneous dislike to.”Gradi, however, was such an admirer of Bennell he supplied a character reference on behalf of his former colleague when the man he appointed in 1985 was arrested during a tour with the Stone Dominoes youth team to Florida nine years later. Gradi’s initial information was that the rape allegation was “sour grapes” from a disgruntled player.“The first time I believed the allegations was when I went to the local Spa and bumped into the mother of another boy who had been with us. His friend, who had come to us from Manchester City, had apparently told his parents about Bennell, but no complaint had ever been made to either me or this club.” He adds: “Until this case came along I was fairly confident that I knew everything that was going on around the club.”The only complaint about Bennell, according to Gradi, related to the coach’s “authoritarian streak” and one occasion when the youth team were made to “walk home from the countryside after a poor game”. Bowler refers to the same incident, believed to relate to a match at Manchester United when Bennell dropped off a minibus of teenagers at Beeston Castle, 15 miles from Crewe, pointed them in the wrong direction and told them to find their own way back. Several hitch-hiked.“I seem to recall there had been a complaint from a father of one of these boys,” Bowler writes. “I spoke to Dario Gradi about it and Barry Bennell was, to the best of my recollection, reprimanded.”“I do not believe there was the same amount of awareness of the dangers posed by sexual predators such as Barry Bennell. It is fair to say that we, as a club (like the rest of society), did not appreciate many of those dangers at that time, although the general care and safety of the young boys was very important to the club.”As for Bennell’s departure from the club, Gradi’s explanation that it was purely a football matter is followed by other passages appraising him as one of the best talent-spotters in the business. Bennell, he says, was “almost Brazilian” in terms of having “all the skills of tricks and flicks that would get the kids excited”. He had a talent for recruiting youngsters who seemed devoted and loyal to a man with a “lot of charm and a great hold over the boys he had recruited”. Gradi even admits being worried by the possibility that if Bennell ever joined another club the players at Crewe would follow him.“I accept I was responsible for appointing Barry Bennell to the club,” Gradi, who makes no reference to having coached Bennell in Chelsea’s youth system during the early-1970s, writes. “I made no detailed inquiries as to his background before taking him on. From the inquiries that I did make, I gleaned that Barry Bennell was a well-respected coach in the Manchester area and that was good enough for me. He did not have any specific coaching qualifications but none were required and at the time the FA did not publish any guidance on child protection.”Gradi’s ongoing suspension is from all football-related matters while the FA’s inquiry, led by Clive Sheldon QC, investigates what happened at Crewe as well as claims that in his coaching days at Chelsea he visited the house of a 15-year-old youth-team player to “smooth over” a complaint of sexual assault against Eddie Heath, the chief scout who has been identified as a repeat offender."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00d3712f51b5443c4b7c6e777705000b6a333c76/31_200_3335_2001/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ca4c865e3e816cd19a1dee3c0578eae","title":"david luiz maurizio sarri lift chelsea tottenham","story":"• Centre-back says manager deserves respect of everybody• ‘We all believe in the way he wants us to play’David Luiz has delivered a public show of support for Maurizio Sarri and insisted Kepa Arrizabalaga’s refusal to be substituted late in the Carabao Cup final was not indicative of a lack of respect within the Chelsea squad for their beleaguered head coach.Sarri has found himself under mounting pressure with open dissent voiced by those in the stands over his tactics, most notably during the recent FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Manchester United, and with domestic results stuttering badly. Arrizabalaga’s show of dissent in the match against Manchester City on Sunday, later put down to a misunderstanding, fuelled the sense that the mutinous mood is now spreading to those on the pitch.While no senior players attempted to usher Arrizabalaga off in the last minute of extra time with the fourth official holding up his number and Sarri and his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, calling him to the sidelines, it is understood that the 24-year-old’s actions did not impress members of his side. David Luiz spoke to the goalkeeper at the time, shielding his mouth so he could not be lip-read, but the £71.3m world-record signing, who had apparently been suffering from cramp, made it clear he was not injured and was intent on finishing the tie.Sarri did criticise the player’s conduct in refusing to leave the pitch and spoke to Arrizabalaga in the dressing-room at Wembley. The goalkeeper subsequently insisted it had “never been my intention to go against the manager”. He went further on social media: “I have full respect for the coach and his authority.”“The coach has the power over the group and he has our respect,” said David Luiz. “For me there is not a problem here with that. We all believe in his philosophy. We all believe in the way he wants us to play. That’s why we did a great game against the best team in Europe at the moment. Apart from that, it was a misunderstanding and we all want to do the best for Chelsea.That rather overlooked the reality that Sarri, who has previously stubbornly stuck to the principles of Sarriball, had asked his team to adopt a far more pragmatic, counterattacking style at Wembley, more akin to previous Chelsea managers’ approach, as he attempted to ward off a repeat of the 6-0 defeat suffered at City a fortnight previously. This was despite Zola stating only last week that they would not “change what we believe is good for this club because, otherwise, we are nothing”.Sarri conducted a team-talk before the players’ warm-down session at Cobham on Monday as preparations began for Wednesday’s visit of Tottenham in the Premier League, when Arrizabalaga is expected to retain his place. Chelsea will need to be just as resilient as they seek to stay in touch with the top four.“This has been our problem in the season: consistency, not just in results but to fight for every match,” said David Luiz. “We have had some great performances, like Sunday against City and at home against them, when they were still unbeaten.“It is up to us to find consistency for every single match because now we have another tough game and we will need another high performance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09cd105911f0d17e9476401f866e1c947efbf463/0_89_1182_709/master/1182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38316a4a6573afc40e878fbea2b7d39e","title":"emiliano sala plane fell thousands of feet in seconds investigators say","story":"AAIB queries whether pilot David Ibbotson was licensed to carry footballerThe plane that crashed in the Channel carrying the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala fell thousands of feet in the space of 20 seconds after making a 180-degree turn, minutes after the pilot requested a descent, air accident investigators have found.The wreckage of the Piper Malibu light aircraft was found on the seabed 30 metres from where final radar readings located it at an altitude of 1,600ft (488 metres), suggesting it dropped almost vertically in its final moments, according to an interim report from the Air Accident Investigations Board.Investigators have not concluded what caused the plane to crash, but the pilot requested a descent four minutes earlier, apparently to avoid cloud and maintain vision. Unconfirmed radar readings indicate the plane may have climbed rapidly before its final descent.The AAIB said its ongoing investigation would focus on trying to understand the radar readings from the last moments of the flight, as well as analysing the possible contribution of bad weather.Investigators have also queried the legal status of the flight and the pilot’s licence to carry Sala. “We are also concerned to discover that the trip involved an aircraft which did not conform to either UK Civil Aviation Authority or US Federal Aviation Administration requirements for commercial activity and therefore may have been operating unlawfully. We welcome further investigation into the accident.” Sala, 28, died of head and trunk injuries, according to a postmortem examination, when the aircraft crashed at 8.16pm on 21 January on its way from Nantes to Cardiff.The missing pilot, David Ibbotson, 59, has yet to be located. The wreckage of the fuselage – in three pieces, with wings and tailfin missing – was found on the seabed, 68 metres below the surface, off Guernsey in the Channel Islands on 3 February. Sala’s body was recovered and identified three days later.Challenging weather conditions made it too difficult to recover the plane wreckage from the sea, and instead the AAIB obtained evidence from extensive video captured by a remotely operated underwater vehicle. The family of Ibbotson, from Crowle in Lincolnshire, hope that a fresh search for the pilot’s body will begin this week, after an online crowdfunding campaign raised more than £250,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcde53687e5e0b6c37f8358ab36ce79eaa524122/0_94_5328_3196/master/5328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8481b436d865420d3a15763aafefa487","title":"leicester brendan rodgers manager celtic neil lennon","story":"• Club believe they can hire Rodgers this season• Celtic would demand £5m in compensationLeicester City are stepping up attempts to hire Brendan Rodgers as their new manager immediately, with the club believing there is now the prospect of him being coaxed from Celtic before the end of the season.Rodgers is Leicester’s principal candidate to replace Claude Puel, who was sacked on Sunday. The former Liverpool manager has privately insisted he will finish this season in Glasgow, where Celtic remain on course to win a third domestic treble in succession. However, Leicester are keen to push for a quick appointment and thereby prepared to test the resolve both of Celtic and their manager.A compensation figure of £5m has not dissuaded those at the King Power Stadium from an approach. However, it remains to be seen where Rodgers would remain firmly of a mind to complete the season north of the border and, indeed, whether such a stance would be deemed acceptable by Leicester.Rodgers is due to meet with the media on Tuesday, in advance of the Premiership meeting with Heart of Midlothian on Wednesday evening. Any immediate exit from Celtic by the 46-year-old would cause the Scottish champions an unforeseen problem at a key season juncture.Neil Lennon, who departed Hibernian in curious circumstances at the end of January, would be viewed as the most obvious candidate to return to Celtic and replace Rodgers in the short term at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd8ec82272151d977561f28d907dd2c097c3d42/0_330_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b036b8b316bc6d1472a9a1882fffd85f","title":"manchester city quadruple bid carabao cup","story":"It is probably fair to say Manchester City’s in-house team made the fawning soft-focus documentary All or Nothing a year too soon. “Guys we are so close!”. That was your catchphrase. Except, they weren’t really.City won the Premier League by a mile last year thanks to a run of sustained sublime form. But otherwise their season lost its dramatic tension on 4 April when City were eviscerated by Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final first leg, shrinking the scope of their ambitions to that near-perfect league season. Fast forward 10 months and Sunday’s slow-burn victory in the Carabao Cup final has set up a fascinating point of contrast one of those moments where the background noise starts to fall away and it makes sense, for the first time, to contemplate the wildly improbable.All Or Not Quite Nothing would be a fair billing for the next three months, which are by comparison fretted with intrigue. City have a maximum of 20 matches left to play this season. In the course of which this team has a chance to add the three biggest trophies in English club football, a four-pronged feat that still looks an impossible stretch of luck, resources and the competing claims of every other club in the scrum for honours.Most things do not happen. This one will probably not either. But then very few have ever been this close or, indeed, so close with some key factors in their favour. It was notable when Pep Guardiola was asked about the prospect of a quadruple he did not roll his eyes and say “fuck” as he did two years ago, but instead dismissed the idea in more measured terms.Nobody manages the details like Guardiola. He knows exactly where City stand. The squad is strong. The fixtures are tough but not impossible. City have won 13 of their last 15 games. So, for now, let’s just take a moment to dream.Straight away City have an advantage on timing. The fixtures come thick but not that fast. If they can finish off Schalke in two weeks’ time and get past Swansea in the FA Cup there is one obvious logjam to come. Between 6 April and 24 April City would play six high-pressure games in 19 days, a run that goes: FA Cup semi Champions League quarter-final (first leg) Crystal Palace away Champions League quarter-final (second leg) Tottenham at home Manchester United away.Get through another flurry around the Champions League semi-finals and the season ends in fairly orderly fashion. Brighton away is the final Premier League fixture on 12 May. The FA Cup final is on 18 May. The distant prospect of a Champions League final would round things off on the first day of June.It is an unusually well spaced-out endgame, and a favourable turn for any club caught in the familiar English slog through the spring. By comparison Manchester United’s treble-winning season 20 years ago finished on 26 May, with United required to tie up three trophies in the final 10 days.That United team played seven games in 26 days from the start of May. Should City get as far, they would end with four games in 28 days. Where does the advantage lie? United carried all before them in a glorious adrenal rush, with no time to look down or feel any fear. Could there be another kind of difficulty in that “cold time” between fixtures?There are some more positive lessons to be learned along the way. United had seven different goalscorers in their last seven games, the burden shared as the line approached. And it is here that City also have deeper gears.The only really worrying note is the injury sustained on Sunday by Fernandinho. John Stones’s return from his hamstring twang will also be vital: Vincent Kompany is a great club servant but isolated against a player like Eden Hazard he wheels around like a passenger ferry with a wonky rear thruster these days.On the plus side Bernardo Silva is in excellent shape, all non-stop ferreting intelligence on and off the ball. Left-back has looked like a problem but Oleksandr Zinchenko was magnificent at Wembley. Sergio Agüero is in his absolute pomp right now. Raheem Sterling has five goals and four assists in 10 games, a man running hot at just the right time.Comparisons are of course odious – and indeed meaningless given the complete re-gearing of every part of football’s surfaces from year to year. But with 20 games to win them all, the question will naturally be asked as to where such an achievement would rank.Some will point to the thinning out at the very top, the fact fewer clubs are winning more trophies generally. But it would be incorrect to belittle this as a bought success, a triumph devalued by the extreme amounts of money involved.For a start nobody wins anything these days without spending. That much is a given. Secondly this is above all a City team marked out by the more human elements. To miss the fact Guardiola has improved almost every one of his players, that the team has a system and a way of playing that is thrillingly well-grooved, that City have resisted the urge simply to buy ready-made world stars, is to miss the basic beauty of sport altogether.The one area lacking is some sense of internal, organic growth. Every sporting triumph lacks a little something without an element of home-made talent. United’s treble winners had seven academy products playing regularly in the first team. The greatest British European triumph of all, Celtic in 1967, saw Jock Stein pick a team drawn entirely from the Glasgow districts. City remains a portable project, all outsourced parts, and one that has yet to spawn a regular home-grown City player since the Abu Dhabi takeover. Such is the way of modern football elsewhere too. For now Sunday’s cup final leaves this fine City team 20 games from a sporting feat that will most likely prove beyond them but which has never felt quite so close at hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84dbf1c55571c84eb84ec584a02bcbc5c364a702/0_0_2518_1558/master/2518.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a98fa58290f4276e4f00e2cd4798567 720w","title":"sous vide juicers and toasters the best kitchen appliances to buy","story":"From space-saving cooking solutions to future-facing chefs’ toys, here’s a selection of gadgets to make your kitchen life easierCheck out our discount codes and vouchersA sous vide is one of those chef’s toys you might have always wanted but haven’t been able to justify either the cost or the counter-top space in the kitchen … until now.

Maybe we all need somebody who can be a cheerily oblivious outlet for our antagonismSix in 10 people say they have an archenemy at work, a survey of 7,000 workers has found. The remaining four, I can only assume, must be lying, lacking rich internal lives or between archenemies.No one takes work enemies more seriously than I do, and my perhaps controversial view is that they are not only inevitable, but, approached with the right mindset, a joy.Let me be clear: I am not talking about bullies, narks, saboteurs or anyone who actively strives to make your time at work unpleasant. (The most hated colleagues, according to the Totaljobs survey, were those who took credit for others’ ideas.) That is obviously unacceptable behaviour employers should be attuned to it and committed to flushing it out.I am talking about the colleague you cannot stand, who can be a cheerily oblivious outlet for your innate human pettiness.Of course, you’re a professional about it – you don’t let your private antipathy get in the way of your job, only your closest colleagues know about it and you don’t really wish them harm. In fact, you are extremely nice to them out of spite, while secretly delighting in their inconsequentially misaddressing an email, their saying “would of” instead of “would have” and their criminally unself-aware tweets about #Veganuary. The best workplace nemesis is someone you don’t work with directly, of approximately the same seniority as you, mostly oblivious and ultimately harmless. (I respect those who say the nemesis dynamic is by requisite reciprocal, but in a professional environment, they’re playing with fire.) Also, the dynamic is only sustainable in big offices, where you can surround yourself with people you like.The benefits of having friends at work, not only for employees’ morale and motivation but organisational function, are well known – I’d argue the same applies to enemies. You may well love your job, but let’s not kid ourselves. If work is ever going to be more than something you do for money, you need to be engaged in something other than the actual workaday business of it. A little low-stakes antagonism, lightly worn (and freely shod once you leave the office, lest it fester), motivates you to work harder and be better. If you’re a bit competitive and a lot petty, there is no greater motivation than winning – even if it’s against someone who has no idea that you’re in competition with them.They can even foster better relationships with colleagues: the office enemy of my office enemy is my work friend.The idea, basically, is to write your own workplace sitcom – and no one watched The Office for the paper sales. You need a work spouse (someone you can count on to cheer you on and commiserate with), an office crush (with whom you can harmlessly flirt over Gchat and time your trips to the water fountain with) and an office nemesis to spur you on to greatness.Right now, I am blessed with so many work husbands and wives that I am virtually a professional polygamist (and I also have a delightful office crush), but I am short one subplot. In response to the handful of colleagues who have messaged me this morning asking: “WHO IS IT???”, I regret to say that I am currently sans an office nemesis. But – who knows – perhaps, after reading this, one will make themselves known."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90772104bcf122ac668628cb526eece00e026b8/0_180_4460_2676/master/4460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80baebe59997c18859375802146f5552","title":"has brexit broken british politics podcast","story":"Eleven MPs have now left their political parties to join the Independent Group. ’s political editor, Heather Stewart, asks whether Brexit is pushing British party politics to breaking point.

A press conference in which she only revealed her own inadequacy. Her inarticulacy almost total 15 minutes in which the normal laws of syntax broke down, a public humiliation made all the more excruciating by the lead actor’s almost total lack of self-awareness. Only the hunched shoulders and furtive glances betrayed a primal sense of danger. Her words just words, randomly generated, speaking a different language from her body, a mind body split made in a Cartesian heaven.My name is Theresa May and I’m... She paused, unsure of quite what she was. She checked her notes. That was it, she was the prime minister, even though it had been months – if not years – since she had shown any signs of leadership. But out in the UK badlands, she’d learned that you get what you can get.So we were lumbered with her. For the time being at least. Not that she’d be going quietly: they’d have to come mob-handed to get her out of Downing Street. After all, once Brexit was sorted she still had a domestic agenda to pursue. Yes, she really did hate her country that much.Showing no signs of remorse at having hijacked the first ever meeting of EU and Middle Eastern leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh to talk about Brexit, May blundered on. She’d had some constructive discussions with Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and a few others in which absolutely nothing constructive had been discussed. Or to be more accurate, various people had offered her a way out by way of an extension to article 50 but she had just clamped her hands over her ears and said no.“A delay is a delay,” May said gnomically in answer to questions about why she was so reluctant to consider any possible alternative to taking Brexit down to the wire and forcing MPs to either accept her deal that had been already overwhelmingly rejected or end up with something – either a no deal or delayed Brexit – they might like even less. This was the new mantra. Brexit means Brexit. Delay means delay. Anything means nothing. Nothing means anything. A bad deal is better than a no deal.It was logic that would have insulted a five-year old, but still the prime minister persisted. By now she was on full Maybot, as so often, both there and not there. A mechanical presence, spewing automated responses to entirely different questions from the ones she had been asked. There was plenty of time to get Brexit done by 29 March. Hell, there were more than 30 days, so why all the panic? Brexit was within her grasp. It was within the country’s grasp. Aka, still bewilderingly out of reach.That was a high point. From Maybot, her plan descended into terrifying Dr Strangelove: bomb, bomb, bombety bomb. Here was the plan: rather than agreeing a deal with the EU and then trying to get it through parliament, she was going to do the precise opposite. Instead, she was going to come up with whatever deal she could finesse past the European Research Group in her own party and then present it to the EU as a fait accompli.For the first time, May allowed herself a smile. She couldn’t understand why no one else had thought of this. Negotiating international treaties was so much easier when you didn’t have to negotiate with other countries. Rather you just dreamed up your fantasy scenarios and then told Johnny Foreigner what was going to happen to him. The Hun could be forced to give us their BMWs for next to nothing and in return we’d give them Mark Francois and Boris Johnson. The ideal swap. And if that went well, we might even consider annexing the Sudetenland. It had been at least 80 years since anyone had tried that.One reporter made a final attempt to drag May back to an approximation of reality. Could he just get her to focus on Wednesday? Would she be sacking any ministers who voted for the Cooper-Letwin amendment? The prime minister just gave a blank death stare. Wednesday might never happen. Today might not even be Monday. Tuesday might just be a repeat of Sunday. That noise? The sound of one can kicking.Time and space were merely arbitrary constructs, different ways of measuring eternity. You couldn’t run down an imaginary clock that had no past, and no future. All that was clear was that we reaching the end of time. And as with any May press conference, that moment couldn’t come soon enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0076639cae08c5fcdfcff449c9446182733f8665/356_23_2175_1305/master/2175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee846b9fea74b54a5eaf0ae81daad46b","title":"grayling accused of trying to hold brexit ferry trial in private","story":"Lawyers argue government’s embarrassment is irrelevant to question of confidentialityChris Grayling has been accused of trying to conduct large parts of a trial over the £14m Brexit ferry fiasco in private, against the principle of open justice, the high court has heard.The transport secretary is being sued by Eurotunnel over the allegedly unlawful award of a government contract to Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships, and two other ferry companies, in a case due to start on Friday.Lawyers for Eurotunnel told the high court on Monday that the minister was trying to keep the majority of documents in relation to the contract out of the public domain. They said they did not know his reasons but argued that if Grayling was trying to avoid adverse publicity or embarrassment then this was not legally justifiable.“It appears … that the secretary of state is seeking to maintain extensive claims to confidentiality in relation to large numbers of disclosed documents and appears to intend that large parts, if not all, of the trial should be held in private,” Eurotunnel said in a submission.The company’s lawyers said Grayling’s approach was unjustified and they reminded lawyers for the Department for Transport (DfT) that the judge Mr Justice Fraser had previously told them the court was “not a marketing or PR department for any litigant and the principle of open justice is an important one”.The lawyers told the judge it was clear the vast majority of the material that had been disclosed to them about the Seaborne contract was not confidential and should be available for public scrutiny.“It may be that the material is perceived by government to be profoundly embarrassing and it would naturally prefer that it is not in the public domain. That would be, of course, an entirely irrelevant consideration in relation to matters of confidentiality,” the lawyers for Eurotunnel said.The DfT was ordered to review all 8,000 documents that had been disclosed in the case and to return to court by 4.30pm on Thursday with its legal justification for its desired confidentiality.Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel tunnel, is arguing that ferry contracts totalling £108m were awarded to Seaborne and two other firms through a “secretive and flawed” procurement process.Grayling cancelled the contract with Seaborne this month after it emerged that the company had no contract with the ports involved in the proposed new ferry route between Ramsgate and Ostend.The DfT said it could not comment on ongoing proceedings. In its submissions to the court, it said the scale of disclosure was far greater than anticipated, running to 10,000 documents.It said the burden of disclosure was far greater on the defendant and the process was “extremely time consuming” given the necessary reviews, before submission, of legally and personally sensitive data.The DfT argued it would make the documents available confidentially until the documents relevant to the trial were identified. It said that the legitimate need for confidentiality could not be jettisoned simply because the trial was fast-tracked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af8900be20173b6a2917a6f30bb1d0a72fe08a3/451_39_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=074d04c4971a66e1f2cb3122956e8d2a","title":"independent group rules out electing leader until end of year","story":"MPs expected to make decision once group fulfils ambition to become a political party A leader may not be elected to the newly formed Independent Group of MPs until the end of the year when it hopes to have become a political party.The 11 former Labour and Conservative MPs’ first meeting in Westminster selected Gavin Shuker to act as its convener and organise future meetings but while there were initial conversations about roles and responsibilities, there was no serious discussion as to who might become leader.Chuka Umunna, a former Labour frontbencher, has been widely tipped for the role but friends of Heidi Allen, a former Conservative, have been pressing her to put her name forward when the election process begins.Speaking about the leadership, Allen said immediately after the meeting: “You’ll be gagging to learn we’ve started talking about the other jobs and roles and responsibilities.” Anna Soubry, another group member, added: “The most important thing this week is Brexit.”Over the weekend, Umunna sought to put himself forward, saying: “I’m clear I want to play the biggest role in this group.” It appears, however, that his immediate ambition has been rebuffed, at least temporarily.Others have suggested that Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, could also take the leading role, although because the group has no grassroots members yet, it is not clear how a leader could be legitimately elected.Insiders said the intention was gradually to turn the Independent Group (TIG) into a political party, and there would be “much more clarity about that by the end of the year” – although some specialist spokesperson roles could be assigned much quicker.Donations are understood to be coming “in the hundreds of thousands”, largely from iniduals giving fairly small sums. The money is likely to be spent on support staff initially.Although the group is not required to, it intends to follow Electoral Commission rules and make regular disclosures, reporting the identity of donors who supply more than £7,500 in one year. This follows accusations it could circumvent existing rules because it is not registered as a political party.TIG will not operate a whip, partly to resolve differences of opinion over other policy areas, although the 11 MPs are strongly aligned in opposing Brexit and supporting a second referendum.The first meeting also agreed that any MPs wishing to join TIG will have to apply. In theory, this would allow its members to block MPs who left Labour amid unresolved harassment claims from joining, including John Woodcock or Ivan Lewis.No further defections are anticipated imminently, although the group hopes that the forthcoming parliamentary battles over Brexit could see other MPs coming forward.TIG has no immediate plans to contest any parliamentary byelections or the council elections due in May. Its 11 members have repeatedly ruled out resigning as MPs and triggering a byelection until its organisation develops.Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, said her party needed “to be working together with the Independent Group MPs but we need to find a 2019 way of doing that and I’m open-minded about how that looks”.But despite Lib Dem enthusiasm, TIG MPs said they wanted Lib Dem MPs to quit their party and join them. They argued that the Lib Dem brand has been tarnished by the period when the party under Nick Clegg went into coalition government with David Cameron’s Conservatives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661e71bd59f4cfb7fddafb7c4a3f89906c5c06e6/184_116_2503_1502/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=050d6a7bc4176adf120d1dde19f7420d","title":"labour to back moves for second brexit referendum","story":"Labour leader tells MPs party will back another vote as last resort to stop Tory dealFollow all the latest on Brexit with our live blogJeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party’s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week.The decision to give the party’s backing to a second referendum comes after a concerted push by shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and deputy leader Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to a slew of further defections to the new breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum.Although the move has delighted MPs who are backing the People’s Vote campaign, Corbyn is also likely to face determined opposition from dozens of MPs in leave seats if the party whips to back a second referendum, including a significant number of front benchers.Former shadow minister Lucy Powell said she believed at least 25 MPs would vote against any whip to back a second referendum, meaning that it would face an uphill struggle to pass the Commons without significant Conservative support.A private briefing sent to Labour MPs on Monday nightand seen by the , makes it clear that Labour’s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum.“We’ve always said that any referendum would need to have a credible leave option and remain,” the briefing said. “Obviously at this stage that is yet to be decided and would have to be agreed by parliament.”The briefing also makes it clear that the party would not support no deal being included on the ballot paper. “There’s no majority for a no-deal outcome and Labour would not countenance supporting no deal as an option,” the briefing says. “What we are calling for is a referendum to confirm a Brexit deal, not to proceed to no deal.”The redrawing of Labour’s objectives is likely to stem any fresh flood of resignations next week to TIG, whose members include former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie as well as the ex-Tory MP Anna Soubry, all leading lights of the People’s Vote movement.Corbyn told MPs the party would back a fresh poll as a final resort in order to stop “a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.” Speaking to MPs on Monday night, a week after seven MPs who backed a referendum quit the party, Corbyn said that Labour would first table its own version of a Brexit deal, including a permanent customs union.That amendment is set to be tabled to the government’s Brexit motion on Wednesday, when Labour will also whip to back another amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper and the Tory Oliver Letwin, which would legislate for a delay to the UK’s exit date in order to avoid no deal.May is expected to make a last ditch bid to avoid a serious cabinet rebellion over that amendment this week. The prime minister’s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit if the withdrawal deal does not pass by March 12, though Cooper and Letwin’s backers have suggested they will reject that approach.Party sources said Labour would not introduce or back any amendment for a second referendum this week, but see the crunch point at the next opportunity – likely to be the next meaningful vote on the Brexit deal that May has promised to hold by 12 March.It is highly unlikely Labour’s amendment on its own Brexit deal will pass on Wednesday, making it almost inevitable the party will move to back another referendum.Corbyn told MPs that Labour “cannot and will not accept” May running down the clock towards no deal. “One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal,” he said.“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Yet recriminations came from leave-supporting Labour MPs almost immediately in the private meeting on Monday night. John Mann, a Brexit supporter, said the decision to back a second referendum would cost Labour in the Midlands and the north. “The price will stop you being prime minister,” he told the meeting.Outside the meeting, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said he had “deep reservations” about the possibility of a second referendum and suggested it would not pass the House of Commons.“I think it would be deeply isive. It has a corrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament and it is not clear to me still what should be on the ballot paper,” he said.“I think it is good parliament gets the opportunity to express itself on this option though, we have to get through that and of course if there is a majority for it we will go down that road. My personal view is that majority doesn’t exist and we need a bridge-building, sensible, pragmatic road through.”It is understood around a dozen shadow ministers could consider their positions if Labour whips MPs to back a second referendum.Those who vocally oppose a second referendum include shadow justice minister Gloria de Piero, shadow housing minister Mel Onn and shadow education minister Tracy Brabin as well as backbenchers including Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy.A total of 17 Labour MPs, including eight shadow ministers, voted against or abstained on Cooper’s previous amendment to extend article 50 last month.MPs who have backed a second referendum were cautiously optimistic about the Labour announcement. Clive Lewis, the shadow Treasury ministers who backs the pro-referendum Best for Britain campaign, said Labour “would never have been forgiven for facilitating Tory Brexit” and said it was now offering “real and unambiguous opposition.”Future Labour support for a second referendum could come in the form of backing for a proposed amendment to the meaningful vote proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.That proposal would approve May’s deal subject to a fresh referendum, though senior Labour officials are thought to be uneasy about backing any amendment that endorses the Tory Brexit deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df0a3fa907e9df195b2f7abfdf65a9f738dece3/0_98_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669a133bab15b3d217065654dcf808ca","title":"what does labour brexit second vote referendum commitment mean","story":"Jeremy Corbyn’s announcement paves the way for the party backing a second referendumYes, in principle. But not quite yet.The party wants MPs to vote on its own Brexit plan on Wednesday first, when the next round of motions about the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union are debated in the Commons.That is expected to be defeated, at which point Labour has announced it is “committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.No date has been set for the next round of votes, but Theresa May has said that she will put her Brexit deal to the vote on 12 March. A second referendum amendment is expected then.This is not decided. One possibility is that Labour will back the so-called Kyle-Wilson compromise, an amendment being promoted by two Labour backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.The essence of their amendment is that Labour would allow May’s Brexit deal to pass the Commons in return for it being subject to approval via a second referendum.But there are deep reservations about the Kyle compromise in some Labour circles because it would involve Labour allowing May’s Brexit deal to pass. When asked about the amendment, a Labour source repeated that the party “would not vote for a damaging Tory Brexit”.Kyle himself says that Labour could abstain to allow May’s deal through but that may not persuade the doubters. On the other hand, without promising that Labour would allow May’s Brexit deal through parliament, there is no realistic prospect of attracting Conservative support.Probably not, although it is not certain. The Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, estimated that there would be 25 Labour MPs who would simply not support a second referendum, regardless of how a motion backing it would be phrased.Only a handful of Tories support a second referendum – probably fewer than 10 – so without the support of Downing Street, it remains very unlikely to pass the Commons even with Scottish National party and Liberal Democrat support.The strength of Labour’s move is that it helps bring the parliamentary party together, at a point when the Conservatives are increasingly ided over a no-deal Brexit and the anti-Brexit Independent Group is hoping for more defections from Labour.The principal issue uniting the eight former Labour and three former Conservative MPs in TIG is opposition to Brexit and support for a second referendum. By finally opening the door to supporting a second referendum, Labour closes off their principal selling point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55a8e22fea51a64df9d1ddd41aa5dcd30d53d5b1/0_82_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1ed58ad33bdec67495baa5b36b5122e","title":"brexit latest news developments theresa may increasingly likely to accept article 50 extension minister suggests politics live","story":"Opposition says it will back or put forward amendment for public vote if its alternative to Theresa May’s Brexit plan is voted down by MPsHere’s a summary of the evening’s events:We’re going to close down this live blog now, so thanks for reading and for the comments. If you’d like to read yet more, my colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story:Here’s a little more on those comments from the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. She was asked by Channel 4 News if there would be no option to remain on a Labour-backed second referendum. She replied:No, no, no, no. What I’m saying is that we would have a referendum on whatever deal it is that may or may not pass through Parliament and we would be saying to people: ‘Do you want this, or do you want to remain?’Asked on which side she would be in that referendum, she said:It’s no secret I think that it’s in Britain’s interests for us to remain in the European Union. I’ve always thought so and I continue to think so. And so, if there is a vote of that sort, I would certainly be campaigning for us to remain.She added: “yeah, of course” when asked if, in that case, she would be on the same side of the referendum campaign as her party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. And, asked to clarify if she was saying explicitly that Corbyn would campaign to remain in the European Union, Thornberry said:If it’s a choice between a disastrous Tory Brexit or no deal and remaining, then that is what we will have to do.Similar to the Lib Dems, the SNP is calling on Corbyn to explicitly confirm that remain would be an option in a Labour-backed second referendum. Its Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said:Scotland did not vote for Brexit and we must not be dragged out of the EU against our will. Remaining is by far the best deal of all – and it is the only way to protect jobs and living standards.The Labour frontbencher, Emily Thornberry, has said remain should be an option on a second referendum and, more than that, Labour would campaign for it.The Conservative party chairman, Brandon Lewis, has said Corbyn’s position makes it clear the Labour leader wants to “betray the will of the British people and ignore the biggest democratic vote in our nation’s history”.Corbyn’s Labour have ripped up their promise to respect the referendum result and are now pursuing a isive second referendum that would take us back to square one. Once again it’s clear: Jeremy Corbyn is using Brexit to play his own political games.Instead of working to thwart Brexit at this critical stage, Jeremy Corbyn should put the country’s interest before his party’s – by backing a deal that respects and delivers on the result of the referendum. columnist, Polly Toynbee, is welcoming of Corbyn’s announcement this evening – but urges him now to go the whole hog.The defection of eight Labour MPs seems to have had a big effect, breaking the obstinacy of the leadership team. Today the pressure mounted further, with deputy leader Tom Watson talking of setting up a social democratic grouping, and Momentum’s chair, Jon Lansman, openly criticising the leadership over antisemitism. It seems to have finally jolted Corbyn into action. A deepening ide between shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Corbyn over a range of issues has been brewing, but failure to back the KyleWilson plan would be the breaking point for many in Labour, with frontbenchers among those poised to resign. MPs have shown me an avalanche of emails from local party members resigning over Corbyn’s Brexit feebleness.Plaid Cymru’s Brexit spokesman, Hywel Williams, has accused Jeremy Corbyn of having to be “dragged kicking and screaming” towards a second referendum with remain as an option.But still, the Labour frontbench can’t bring itself to do so without pointless, time-wasting conditions. It almost seems as if Labour will only back a People’s Vote when it is too late.For all that we know, Labour may not even back a referendum that includes the option to remain, despite it having up to a 10-point lead in the most recent polls. This is yet another attempt to cover up the cracks created by its internal isions, but more prevarication won’t do that.Labour has already given up valuable time for navel gazing when it should and could have been working constructively across party lines to deliver the solution that so many want to see.Again, this week, Labour will push for its failed renegotiation option. Its intransigence is exasperating. We can only hope then, that its promise of backing a ‘public vote’ – that includes the option to remain – will be a real one come the meaningful vote next month.While Williams is not the only person to express reservations about what options would be on a Corbyn-backed referendum, it is worth reading his comments in the context of the previous post – as well as this one.The chairman of the Leave Means Leave campaign group, John Longworth, described the Labour move as a “cowardly decision from a man who should never be trusted with the premiership of this country”. He said:As we noted earlier, Corbyn’s announcement today is consistent with Labour’s conference motion from last September. And it is for precisely that reason that Luciana Berger, one of the MPs who resigned from Labour last week, is unimpressed by it:Another of them, Angela Smith, was somewhat more upbeat, saying she would be delighted if Labour backed a second referendum with remain as an option and telling Sky News Corbyn’s move “looks like a very positive development”.Corbyn is addressing the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, where similar concerns are being raised:There has been some discussion about whether or not Labour’s second referendum, should it come to pass, would include remain as an option.It’s worth noting at this point that the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has consistently backed such a move – including as recently as last month, when he told a Fabian Society event:I don’t think it is any secret I firmly believe there should be a remain option – and there has to be a genuine leave option.The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, has said he will work with Labour on the plan – but made clear any referendum must include that remain option.We have long argued it is the right and logical thing to do for the people to have the final say on Brexit. We welcome any MPs who share this crucial aim.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, also welcomed Corbyn’s move, saying:It is the right decision for London – and for the whole country – to give the public their say for the first time on a final Brexit deal.I hope members of parliament will support this move, which is vital to protect jobs and growth. The prime minister must now withdraw article 50 to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal within weeks and to give us time to sort out her mess.Corbyn said Labour’s action is consistent with a motion the party backed at its party conference in September last year. This seems to be correct. Here’s the relevant section of the composite motion:Should parliament vote down a Tory Brexit deal or the talks end in no deal, conference believes this would constitute a loss of confidence in the government. In these circumstances, the best outcome for the country is an immediate general election that can sweep the Tories from power.If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. If the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.Labour has said this evening that the second referendum portion of its move is aimed at preventing Theresa May from forcing through either her deal as it stands or no deal – not necessarily at stopping Brexit in any form.If the prime minister were to adopt a Brexit stance Labour felt it could back, there would be no push for a second referendum.The shadow Brexit secretary put it like this:The prominent remain-supporting Labour MP, David Lammy, has welcomed the move. Lammy, who campaigns for a second referendum with the People’s Vote group, said:Even if MPs can agree some sort of deal, it would be wrong to force it on the British people when we now know so many of the promises made in 2016 have been broken and any deal will be worse than the one we’ve already got inside the EU.These are dangerous times for the Labour party and our country. Jeremy Corbyn is today taking the first step to reunite our party by showing he is listening to our voters and members on this, the biggest issue of our time. But it is also crucial when food prices are already rising and car manufacturers are scrapping investment that we provide the clarity needed to plan for the future.Here’s the full text of the amendment Corbyn intends to table on Tuesday:That this house instructs ministers(a) to negotiate with the EU for changes to the political declaration to secure: i. A permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EUii. Close alignment with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligationsiii. Dynamic alignment on rights and protectionsiv. Commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation andv. Unambiguous agreement on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases(b) To introduce primary legislation to give statutory effect to this negotiating mandateCorbyn says Labour’s move will be two-pronged. He will first seek to force Theresa May to adopt his party’s approach to Brexit by tabling an amendment to the government’s motion. His five demands are, in his words:And he also plans to announce his support for an amendment taking no deal off the table to the parliamentary Labour Party this evening, as well as saying Labour will “put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit”.He’ll tell Labour MPs:The prime minister is recklessly running down the clock, in an attempt to force MPs to choose between her botched deal and a disastrous no deal. We cannot and will not accept.Last week, after our visit to talk to EU officials and leaders in Brussels and Madrid, no one can be in any doubt Labour’s alternative Brexit plan is serious and credible. We are convinced our alternative, which puts jobs and living standards first, could command support in the House of Commons, bring people who voted leave and remain together, and be negotiated with the EU.That’s why we will be putting down an amendment in parliament this week setting out Labour’s plan: For a comprehensive customs union with a UK say close alignment with the single market guarantees on rights and standards protection for Britain’s role in EU agencies and a security agreement which guarantees access to the European arrest warrant and vital shared databases. And we will be calling for legislation to underpin this mandate.We will also be backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment to rule out a no deal outcome. One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal.That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd5974606511bd04eae5dc82ac6a1398f65bd00/42_168_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=808c7e2d525123f3380152c432f19005","title":"did you solve it the worlds strangest families","story":"Answers to today’s kinship riddlesEarlier today I set you the following five puzzles.1) Anna’s father has four daughters.

The couples are therefore Man 1 and Mum 2, and Man 2 and Mum 1. If the first couple have Son A, and the second couple have Son B, then Son A is half-brother to Man 2, and thus half-uncle to Son B, who is Man 2’s son. It’s easier to see when drawn as a family tree.3) A certain man had great grandchildren, yet none of his grandchildren had any children. How come?The question talks about great grandchildren, not great-grandchildren. The hyphen makes all the difference. The grandchildren were great, top, brilliant and awesome, but childless.4) What’s the smallest possible number of people in a family group that contains a grandfather, a grandmother, two fathers, two mothers, four children, three grandchildren, one brother, two sisters, two sons, two daughters, one father-in-law, one mother-in-law and one daughter-in-law?Seven.

A few seconds later the plane crosses the International Date Line, and Olivia is born. She is thus born on February 28, making her the ‘younger’ sister with a calendar birth date one day before her brother’s. On leap years, however, Olivia will celebrate her birthday two calendar days before her older twin.I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles.

When they did so 12 months ago in the build-up to their Calcutta Cup match, they then lost to Scotland. England were decidedly sluggish at Murrayfield and after the match Jones said: “We changed the preparation for this game remarkably. We got Georgia in as we wanted to improve our set-piece work and that didn’t transfer to the game.”Ewels’ inclusion, after Lawes was ruled out for the rest of the championship on Sunday, is the only change to the squad that travelled to Wales last week. Chris Ashton, who missed the 21-13 defeat in Cardiff with a calf injury, has not been included for the camp which runs from Tuesday to Friday while Jones has opted against sending any fringe members of his matchday squad back to their clubs. Jonny May will continue his return-to-play protocols in Oxford after failing his head injury assessment on Saturday.Ewels’ Bath clubmates Sam Underhill and Anthony Watson will also attend the camp for medical checks with both currently sidelined through injury. Underhill has not featured since picking up an ankle injury in December while Watson has been out of action since last March with an achilles problem.Wales’s victory over England on Saturday was watched by a peak audience of 8.9m on the BBC, eclipsing both of the broadcaster’s high-profile FA Cup matches involving Manchester United this season. The tournament’s current broadcast deal with the BBC and ITV runs until 2021 and a move to paid-for TV has been discussed as part of plans for the creation of a new world league.

Owen Farrell is one of the best fly-halves in the world, if not the best, but everyone has off days and he just did not seem to have a feel for the game. We did not see adaptability from England – if one thing is not working, then try something else – and George Ford could have made all the difference.Wales were very good defensively, very well organised by Jonathan Davies in the wide channels and as a result we did not see space opening up out there as we did against France and a little bit against Ireland. Manu Tuilagi had one brilliant run but England needed more of it, Henry Slade was very strong defensively but not involved in the game and the back three were spectators to what was going on inside.When I say that Farrell did not have a feel for the game, he just seemed a bit too wedded to the kicking strategy. On the few occasions that England made dents with their powerful runners, when they did get on top, that was when Farrell needed to keep playing. You have a look to see where it goes, maybe it forces a penalty, maybe it leads to another linebreak but what we saw too often was another kick and it was obviously not working.That led to frustration, the penalty count started to creep up and that was when Ford needed to be introduced. He has a bit more of an attacking mind-set and England would have benefited from that change of direction, just as Wales did when Dan Biggar came on.England did not play particularly badly. It was a game of fine margins. But there was room to play a bit more when they got in behind. Instead they backed their kicking game, which worked perfectly in the first two matches but will never be perfect every time. Rugby just is not like that and even the All Blacks have to adapt if things are not going to plan. You do that by having different options on the bench and trusting them.With Ford on the pitch, England could have moved the point of attack, which would have brought Slade into proceedings. Davies and Hadleigh Parkes defended very well but, when there are 60-70 minutes on the clock, force them to make more tackles on the outside – not just after four or five phases but 10 or 12. Wales clearly targeted Farrell and starved him of space but, if Ford comes on, Farrell shifts to 12 and you then have two playmakers on and he has that little bit more time on the ball. That takes a bit of pressure off Farrell and allows Ford to control the attacking side of things. Farrell still leads as he does but from a different role.The thing with Ford is that you know he is going to move the ball. You still have Slade on the pitch, Elliot Daly, Farrell and Ben Youngs so you have plenty of kicking options as well as a more attacking mind-set, late in the game when there are a few soft shoulders and you tend to get over the gainline a little bit more. Keep playing, move the point of attack, move the Wales forwards around because they are going to be tired after a hell of a shift.Farrell is a world-class player but there is an expectation that these guys should be performing to their very best every single week. The game is so emotional at Test level and it takes a huge toll. England had that incredible performance in Ireland, then followed it up against France. Then you have a week off and it can often come at the wrong time. You are on such a high, then you all take a breath and then you have to come back up all over again. As Alun Wyn Jones said afterwards, Wales do not want this fallow week. They are on a roll, 12 wins in a row, and they want to keep those emotional levels high.Warren Gatland said it – Wales have forgotten how to lose and that is a great characteristic to have. They are like junkyard dogs, they scrap and fight for everything, Shaun Edwards has the defence very organised, they knew England were going to kick and they prepared for it. They exited on their terms, they won the aerial battle and they looked after the ball so much better than they did against France and Italy. They are the favourites now, the team to beat but that expectation brings a whole new set of pressures, from within and externally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4662f61317ea0f71b4fe2db937d89d8512ccd482/0_367_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9443bc31b89a127deac0e1c10919e89e","title":"glory review dukes lancaster racism wrestling sport nick ahad","story":"Dukes, LancasterThree young fighters grapple with a world of blue-eyed heroes and foreign-looking villains in Nick Ahad’s witty playReal life has a way of sneaking into the theatre. Only days after Angela Smith appeared to use the phrase “funny tinge” to refer to people from minority ethnic backgrounds, the former Labour MP’s remark makes an appearance in this collaboration between the Dukes, Red Ladder and Tamasha. The comment is a good fit for Nick Ahad’s play, which is knowingly structured like a racist joke from the 1970s – the kind that would have begun: “This black lad, this Chinese lad and this Syrian walk into a gym.”As it happens, the owner of that gym, a wrestling has-been once celebrated under the fighting name of Jim Glory, makes it a rule for his proteges to keep real life out of the ring. Played by Jamie Smelt with a delusional, David Brent-like sense of his own worth, he believes in simple narratives, the instant goodie-versus-baddie stories that keep wrestling fans baying. He doesn’t want the complications of people’s actual experience when he can have the easy stereotypes of blue-eyed heroes and foreign-looking villains. For him, wrestling is show business, appealing to the gut not the head and, he reckons, all the more perfect an artform for it.His problem is with his fighters, who can’t help but bring real life in with them. Joshua Lyster’s Ben, Josh Hart’s Dan and Ali Azhar’s Sami are all victims and perpetrators of racial discrimination, pigeonholing each other even as they cry foul about the injustices they suffer. What all of them lack is the chance to be heroes of their own stories. For as long as the white leading man – or “babyface” – remains the norm in wrestling, as in life, they will be cast as outsiders.There’s a mechanistic quality to Ahad’s script: confessional soliloquies punctuate a conventional story about a down-at-heel gym making an 11th-hour comeback. But there’s also a wit in his writing and a generosity in Rod Dixon’s production that carries you along. Staged in a wrestling ring, like Claire Luckham’s Trafford Tanzi, it has the best stage fighting this side of the Royal Albert Hall, courtesy of choreographer Kevin McCurdy, and a keen sense of an old order being upturned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d87e4a49675fa641ab58ad249621d3f2faa3b6c/0_126_2834_1701/master/2834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1926e07ccf77e6e485463360806a2f4","title":"a bunch of eejits taking on the world the gloriously gobby derry girls are back","story":"It is Ulster’s answer to Reservoir Dogs. The stars and creator of the riotous runaway hit reveal how it has changed their lives – and could even end up as a movieAs TV debuts go, last year’s Derry Girls was nothing short of phenomenal. The coming-of-age comedy followed four teenage girls from Northern Ireland and their witless sidekick James as they navigated both minor aggravations and Troubles-inflected dramas in mid-1990s Derry.It became an instant classic and was picked up for another season before its second episode had aired. The show, which returns to Channel 4 this week, averaged 2.5 million viewers across the UK, including half of all TV watchers in Northern Ireland. Unsurprisingly, it has changed the lives of its titular girls and “that wee English fella”, as Dylan Llewellyn will now for ever be known – much to their various families’ delight.A recent trip to the garden centre left Nicola Coughlan – who plays nervy Clare, who came out at the end of the first season – wanting to die quietly behind some potted plants. Her mother (“She’s, like, the proudest mother in Ireland”) joked to the cashier about being surprised her daughter was helping her bag their purchases – “cos she’s FAMOUS!” When the cashier didn’t laugh, her mother repeated the joke, only louder. “Oh, kill me now,” thought Coughlan.On shoots, says the show’s creator Lisa McGee, what seems like the entire population of Derry now gathers around, not so much to point and gawk but to keep guard – and even “tell the dogs off for barking”. Given all this, it isn’t hard to see where the show’s domestic authenticity comes from.I meet some of the team in London, after a screening for the second season. At the recent premiere in Derry, they tell me, there was a Q\u0026ampA, but the only people who managed to get any questions in were friends and family. This close-knit environment reminds me of the show’s start, in which one girl reads another’s diary aloud: “Everybody knows everybody, knows everything about everybody, and sometimes all I really want is to be simply left alone.”Listening to them rattle off their stories is a bit like watching a Tina Fey-style show about a show. But if it is hard to see where their real lives stop and their on-screen characters start, that is because McGee is an uncommonly observant writer. From the Friday-night chip shop order to the minutiae of laundry day, Derry Girls revels in everyday detail to a Seinfeldian degree. When you stir in confused teens, perpetually irritated parents (“You can’t ring Childline every time your mother threatens to kill you!”), and McGee’s extraordinary dialogue, the result is TV dynamite. After the first episode, one reviewer commented that there wasn’t much of a storyline. Which, if you’re looking for weapons-grade narrative, is true: not much ever happens. But it’s very, very funny.The political situation of 90s Northern Ireland is largely in the background, with armed soldiers caught in shot as the Steadicam glides past – though sometimes it is a peg on which to hang jokes. When English troops with machine guns board the school bus at a checkpoint, James freaks out. “What’s going on?” he whispers anxiously. “Dunno,” says Michelle, louder, nodding at one of them. “But do you think if I told him I had an incendiary device down my knickers, he’d have a look?”There are no great quests, for love or even a meaning to life. Instead, the viewer is treated to a litany of abortive journeys and excellent putdowns (“Ach, Fionnula what about ye?” Erin’s Aunt Sarah says, on finding the owner of the chip shop in the living room. “I thought I could smell vinegar.”) Then there are the inconsequential crushes and dismissive nuns. Headmistress Sister Michael, an audience favourite played by Siobhán McSweeney, is a combination of all the teachers McGee had as a pupil.“I don’t know if they make them like that any more,” she says. “That type of female teacher, who could be just thinking about looking at you and you’d be shaking.” When she announces upcoming GCSEs, Sister Michael says: “I know how daunting resit examinations can be, so if anyone is feeling anxious or worried, or even if you just want to chat, please, please, do not come crying to me.” Crucially, in Derry Girls, no lessons are ever learned.There is no shortage, these days, of shows about schoolchildren and their family lives, but Derry Girls stands out. McGee says she was heavily influenced by My So-Called Life, the series about Pittsburgh teenagers taking on everything from alcoholism to child abuse. The show, which aired in the mid-90s, centred on the character of Angela Chase, played by Claire Danes.“She had thoughts and opinions that, until I watched the show, I’d assumed were unique to me,” says McGee. There were, however, a few things McGee was not quite so able to connect with, in particular the fact that Chase was effortlessly beautiful and got off with Jared Leto. Such disconnects feed into Derry Girls, giving the show its two big themes: the irrelevance of cool and the unimportance of male validation.Jamie-Lee O’Donnell, who plays gobby lad-mad Michelle, thinks back to her own all-girl Catholic school. “There wasn’t a cool crowd and a geeky crowd,” she says. “There were different characters, but everyone was on a level playing field.”Orla, a Renault Clio obsessive who is Derry’s answer to Phoebe from Friends, certainly isn’t one of the cool crowd, but the character is a favourite not only with viewers but also with most of the actors’ parents, which may be just a little disloyal of them. (“It’s so weird that they tell us!” says Coughlan.)Louisa Harland, who plays Orla, wishes she could be more like the baldly indifferent teenager in real life. “I kind of based my portrayal on Tigger,” she says, referring to Winnie-the-Pooh’s energetic friend. “He’s a flibbertigibbet, a will-o’-the-wisp, a clown.” She seems to thinks that’s a line from AA Milne’s tales but it’s actually from The Sound of Music, a mix-up that makes her more like Orla than she realises. For all its realism, Derry Girls is played – with impeccable timing – for laughs not tears, which makes the show a young female actor’s dream. Saoirse-Monica Jackson, who portrays Erin, the poetry-writing ringleader with delusions of grandeur, says: “To have the opportunity to do this scale of physical TV comedy – you don’t often see that for young women.”Coughlan agrees: “You can tell there’s no male gaze, for how ridiculous we look a lot of the time. I love working with women who are not afraid to look … not ugly, but we do contort our faces a lot.”While naturally circumspect on what’s in store this season, McGee says the political landscape shifts dramatically, but otherwise it’s very much your typical friendship stuff: James tries and fails to stand up for himself, Erin listens a couple of times to Orla, the girls fall out and in, the lot of them still and for ever “the eejits taking on the world”.In the second episode of series one, they filmed the gang strutting down the street to the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack, lugging a jobs noticeboard they stole from the chip shop. (“Couldn’t you have just removed the ads?” someone asks. “They’re only Blu-tacked on!”) It was at this point that McGee realised she had found the losers she’d been searching for. She turned to Michael Lennox, the director, and gasped: “There they are!” As she says now: “They just looked like such a bunch of lovable dicks. I thought, ‘People might get this.’”McGee has a particular overarching political timeframe in mind for the show, with the cast remaining around the same age. Which gives Derry Girls something of a narrow window since, even a year from now, theirs will be less of a gang of girls and more a gang of young women (Coughlan is already 32, mind, but still).McGee is not, however, averse to the idea of a movie, though she does cite the 90-minute length of a typical film as her primary stumbling block. “That terrifies me,” she says. “But I’d love to give it a crack.”• Derry Girls returns on Tuesday 5 March at 9.15pm on Channel 4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8defb47879f4affd967c7130c02876b175a9d4f8/0_142_4286_2573/master/4286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d2d295e54d18eae8cd85fefb2463982","title":"i want to be the bigger man alan partridge writes funny email to the bbc","story":"The presenter has penned a note to his new colleagues at the BBC to ‘clear the air of any residual stench’ as he returns after 24 yearsThis morning, more than 20,000 staff at the BBC arrived at work to an email from their new “colleague” Alan Partridge, ahead of his return to the broadcaster after 24 years. The round-robin message, written in character, urged the thousands of staff to tune in to his new show This Time With Alan Partridge, while simultaneously taking a dig at his former employers at Sky. “Even if nobody else in the country does, we’re already hitting the kind of numbers my shows were getting on Sky Atlantic.”It starts: “Yes, some 24 years after my last presenting gig, the BBC have sidled up to me with a short-term offer to co-present your much-loved magazine show, This Time, standing in for John Baskell who’s been taken ill. Well, although my diary is as clogged as John’s arteries (get well, John!) I have agreed to drop everything and step up.”The note also tackles his old enemies at the BBC, which sacked him for an on-air misdemeanour involving a turkey that led to both his boss and a man in a wheelchair getting punched. He acknowledged that not everyone would be thrilled with his imminent return: “Some of you aren’t going to like that. Some of you made clear when I left that I wouldn’t be welcome back a woman who worked in compliance called Karen or Kate or Kath who had long wavy hair and apparently still works here sneered so hard I thought her face would turn inside out.”It continues: “Back I am, as evidenced by this, my own official BBC email address.

Because I love the BBC and I always have. While others might say it’s a smug anachronism full of braying, know-nothing chancers doling out fat commissions to their braying, know-nothing Oxbridge mates, I don’t.

TV, radio, posters, billboards and huge banners unfurled over public buildings urged the population to get out and vote. Even the electric ticker boards on buses chugging along Havana’s main thoroughfares read “I Vote Yes” (“Yo Voto Sí”).But the state was met with a surprisingly forceful challenge from an unofficial campaign against the new constitution.Evangelical churches concerned that the new constitution would creates a pathway towards gay marriage hung banners reading “marriage: man + woman” from church walls, while religious activists daubed posters on lamp posts – a direct challenge to the state’s monopoly on public space.Although pastors did not explicitly call for a “no” vote, analysts say the church campaign mobilised non-religious, socially conservative sectors of the population to vote against the new constitution.And while state media gave no airtime or column inches to critical voices, #I’mVotingNo (#YoVotoNo) hashtags were trending on Facebook.While older citizens said they voted to support the government, a younger generation of Cubans, particularly those living in the cities, are more daring.Cuban journalist Mónica Rivero, 29, said: “I think the new constitution is too conservative. It crystallises the status quo rather than making changes.”Voting on the island is optional though strongly encouraged by the state and nosy neighbours. Cuba does not allow international observers to monitor its elections but citizens are allowed to watch the vote count at local polling stations.The new constitution reaffirms the Communist Party as the only legitimate political party on the island, defines access to health and education as fundamental rights, and claims that humans can only “reach full dignity” through “socialism and communism”.But there are also big changes. The new constitution introduces presidential term limits and enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest.The document also gives constitutional backing to cautious pro-market reforms carried out since 2011. Private property is recognised, the rights of multinationals investing with the state are strengthened, and the market is recognised as a fact of life.Analysts estimate that one million Cubans now work in the private sector.Emily Morris, an economist from University College London, said the new constitution might open the path to stronger labour rights for those working in the island’s non-state sector.“Worker exploitation is already happening in the private sector,” she said. “But recognising private enterprise could be a step forward by facilitating improved regulation of relationships between employers and employees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716243e3079d3bdefc21900ead7dd346835606e3/0_132_4202_2522/master/4202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a368be8235b49d8de2f414ae673c94e8","title":"irans foreign minister javad zarif announces resignation","story":"Official who negotiated nuclear deal apologises to nation but gives no reason for exitThe Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has resigned without warning, offering an apology to the nation as the nuclear deal he negotiated with world powers stands on the verge of collapse after the US withdrew from it.The veteran diplomat first offered a vague Instagram post with an “apology” for his “inability to continue to his service”. The post included a drawing of Fatima, the daughter of the prophet Muhammad, as Monday marked the commemoration of her birth.A foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, confirmed to the state-run IRNA news agency minutes later that Zarif had resigned but gave no reason for his departure.On Sunday, Zarif criticised Iranian hardliners in a speech in Tehran, saying: “We cannot hide behind imperialism’s plot and blame them for our own incapability.“Independence does not mean isolation from the world,” he said.Zarif’s resignation leaves Iran’s relatively moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, without one of his main allies in pushing the Islamic Republic toward more negotiation with the west.Analysts have said Rouhani faces growing political pressure from hardliners in the government as the unravelling nuclear deal further strains the country’s economy.The US-educated son of a wealthy family, Zarif overcame hardline objections and western suspicions to strike the accord with world powers in which Iran promised to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.The deal later faced a challenge from Donald Trump, who withdrew the US from the accord, fuelling doubts of those in Iran still wary of the US decades after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Zarif himself faced withering criticism at home once for even shaking hands with the then president, Barack Obama.There was no immediate reaction from the US. However, officials in the Trump administration have increased their pressure on Iran on social media. One state department official tweeted an unflattering gif of Zarif saying: “How do you know @JZarif is lying? His lips are moving.”Zarif served as Iran’s ambassador to the UN from 2002 to 2007, first under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and then under the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Ahmadinejad wanted him replaced, but the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, intervened to keep him in the position for another two years as Iran soon found itself an international pariah over its nuclear programme. Iran insisted the programme was for peaceful purposes, while the west claimed it could be used to make nuclear weapons.Secret talks between the US and Iran in Oman became full-fledged negotiations over its nuclear programme. During the talks, Zarif met the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, more than 50 times – something unimaginable only years earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e9c7a2a90d7e303de580a722bae902f9f8b4f59/0_154_2304_1382/master/2304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54b89e2ca9d8dbc07f44e85dc22f14b3","title":"uk outlaw ban hezbollah political wing lebanese","story":"Move to ban Lebanese militant group in its entirety welcomed by Israel and UK Jewish groups The UK is to ban membership of or support for Hezbollah’s political wing, the home secretary has announced, as he accused the Lebanese Islamist movement of destabilising the Middle East.“We are no longer able to distinguish between their already banned military wing and the political party,” Sajid Javid said. “Because of this, I have taken the decision to proscribe the group in its entirety.”The government said the organisation continued to amass weapons in contravention of UN security council resolutions, while its support for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had prolonged “the conflict and the regime’s brutal and violent repression of the Syrian people”.The move comes against the backdrop of a push by the Trump administration to isolate Iran, which backs Hezbollah. Last week the US expressed concern about the group’s growing role in Lebanon’s government.The ban requires endorsement by MPs, probably as early as Friday, potentially posing a dilemma for the Labour leadership, which has in the past advocated dialogue with Hezbollah’s political wing.Hezbollah is a Shia militant movement established in 1982 during the Lebanese civil war. It was the most popular single political party in the country’s parliamentary elections in 2018, and subsequently negotiated for three cabinet seats.Jeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, said: “It is clear the distinction between Hezbollah’s military and political wings does not exist. This does not change our ongoing commitment to Lebanon, with whom we have a broad and strong relationship.”The US, unlike the EU, has proscribed the political wing, and the UK decision may complicate UK diplomatic relations with Lebanon. Hezbollah does not specifically ide itself into armed and political wings, and its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has said the group does not operate as two wings.The decision was welcomed by Israel, which has a decades-long history of conflict with Hezbollah, and by UK-based Jewish groups including Labour Friends of Israel.The Israeli security minister, Gilad Erdan, tweeted: “All who truly wish to combat terror must reject the fake distinction between ‘military’ \u0026amp ‘political’ wings. Now is the time for the EU to follow suit!”The decision was also welcomed by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who said “antisemitism and hate crime have no place in our city”.A recent Labour party internal briefing paper argued against proscription on the basis that there “is a balance between making absolutely clear our abhorrence of using violence to achieve political ends and at the same time encouraging organisations down an effective democratic path. Full proscription could be a move against dialogue and meaningful peace negotiations in Middle East.”The UK has been a regular donor to the Lebanese government, primarily to help it finance refugee camps and jobs for the wave of refugees that have entered the country.Britain proscribes 74 international terrorist organisations under the Terrorism Act 2000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d30fa621ea0013539395efaf3d5d0976b9925e/0_59_4498_2700/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f085be20806d8a46f8c430ec2c47a14e","title":"vaccine scepticism rises in line with votes for populists study finds","story":"Surges in measles cases map tightly to countries where populism is on the marchScepticism about the use of vaccines for children has risen across Europe in line with votes for populists, according to a study, which proposes that public health officials should track populist parties in opinion polls as a proxy signal for vaccine hesitancy.Big surges in the number of measles cases and deaths map to countries where populist parties have become prominent – in particular, Greece, Italy and France.The paper, in the European Journal of Public Health, says there is an underlying link between anti-establishment politics and vaccine hesitancy. “It seems likely that scientific populism is driven by similar feelings to political populism – ie profound distrust of elites and experts by disenfranchised and marginalised parts of the population,” writes the author, Jonathan Kennedy from Queen Mary University of London.As there is a lack of monitoring surveys of attitudes toward vaccines, the researchers argue the performance of populist parties could instead be used to alert public health bodies to rising levels of scepticism.“Support for populist parties could be used as a proxy for vaccine hesitancy, at least in the western European context, with an increase in support being a signal for public health actors to be vigilant,” the paper says.A  investigation in December showed growing concern about the impact of populism on public confidence in vaccines, revealing that measles cases in Europe were at a 20-year high, with 60,000 cases and 72 deaths. The suspicions and rhetoric of anti-vaccination groups have been adopted by some populist politicians, for instance in Italy where the parliament last year passed a law to end compulsory vaccines for children in state schools. Shortly afterwards, the law was repealed because of the “emergency” caused by soaring measles cases.The study mapped findings from the Vaccine Confidence Project, carried out for the European commission, with votes for populist parties in 14 western European countries.It found a strong correlation between votes for populist parties and doubts that vaccines work.“The higher the level of populist votes in a country, the greater the proportion of the population that believe vaccines are not effective,” says the paper. A correlation was also found between voting for populists and believing that vaccination was not important. The UK and Denmark had a higher proportion of people voting for populist parties (Ukip, the BNP and the Danish People’s party) compared with those who had doubts about vaccines than other countries.The study focused on the 2014 European parliament election results, but looked also at the results of the previous national parliamentary election in each country and found the link between voting for populist parties and vaccine hesitancy was even more clear.“We talk about populism and what happens in politics,” said Kennedy, citing Brexit and the difficulties in Greece, “but when you look at what is behind the rise of populism, it is the broad trend of lack of trust in elites and experts. That impacts on academia and public health and issues like climate change and vaccine scepticism.”The study groups together populist parties on the right and the left of politics for their anti-establishment message, which, when it comes to vaccines, appears to translate into an anti-science, anti-public health institutions and anti-pharma message.In the US, President Donald Trump has backed the anti-vaxxers, supporting the discredited theory that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine can cause autism, and inviting the author of the hypothesis, Andrew Wakefield, to his inaugural ball. But not all the distrust of the establishment is from the right, says Kennedy.“Greece has the highest per capita level of measles in western Europe,” he said. “There is a long history of why Greeks don’t trust the state. It goes back to the Ottoman occupation.“The WHO talks about vaccines preventing 2 to 3 million deaths every year. It is very clear that they have a benefit to human society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556d126883cbd7dabce1c052e6e7103e66bab40e/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=979a35ca3c9804b53ac100bcd97ba2a5","title":"venezuela mike pence maduro guaido","story":"Mike Pence says ‘all options are on the table’ in effort to oust Maduro while key allies warn they would oppose sending troopsUS vice-president Mike Pence has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.Both European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.Colombian president Iván Duque, has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were also among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”Pence said he would urge regional powers to freeze Venezuela’s oil assets and hand them over to Guaidó’s control. The opposition have reportedly already taken effective control of US-based refiner Citgo, one of the few remaining profitable assets of Venezuela’s state owned oil firm PDVSA.Earlier that morning the US announced it had added four regional governors to an already long list of sanctioned Venezuelans, and Pence said that tougher measures were still to come.“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks. We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”But much of Venezuela’s government and industry are already sanctioned, making it harder for Guaidó’s allies to ramp up financial pressure on the regime."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Parents are urged to check supplements for children following the findings of UK studyKiller Alan Hawe transferred money to bank account \u0027while his family were dead around him\u0027Suicide note spoke of Alan Hawe\u0026rsquos shame and that \u0026lsquoit was easier for them to die\u0026rsquoSuspension imposed by Garda Commissioner on Fintan Fanning has been liftedViable device could have caused death or injury, Army bomb disposal team saysWoman who bought \u0026euro2,000 flat in Latvia to be placed on list under resolution of court case\u0026lsquoProhibitive cost\u0026rsquo of legal action biggest barrier to wider access, President saysMary Elmes, from Ballintemple, credited with saving 200 Jewish children during HolocaustDrogheda hospital order insurers have already settled more than 200 abuse claimsTaoiseach says Fianna F\u0026aacuteil has offered \u0026lsquono substance of policy, no alternative\u0026rsquoProsecution first of its kind taken by Mental Health Commission under Mental Health ActWitness was giving evidence at inquest into Ballymurphy shootings in which 10 people diedWarmest winter day in UK with 20.6 degrees, but Ireland misses record by one degreeUN special envoy for the Ocean says without beef and car ownership \u0026lsquolife is perfectly okay\u0026rsquoOnline game encouraging children to harm themselves or others may have reached IrelandPatrick Paget\u0026rsquos key social worker told court his attitude had completely changedSt Michan\u0026rsquos crypts to close \u0026lsquofor foreseeable future\u0026rsquo following robbery and vandalismDublin City Council spend in excess of \u0026euro25m for refurbishing over 960 void units in 2018Tusk confirms he has discussed an extension with May: says it is a \u0026lsquorational solution\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806023.1551137454!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clodagh hawe s sister we don t know what the truth is","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlan Hawe (left) with   Clodagh and their sons Liam,  Niall, and Ryan.

We know that he had conflict with a colleague.”She added that Alan Hawe said “he was leading them to a life of ruin essentially and Clodagh would have to clean up his mess. We still don’t know what that mess is. He said the truth was going to come out sometime, we don’t know what that truth is.”In a suicide note he spoke of his shame and that “it was easier for them to die than to have to live with the truth of what he was doing”.Call for changeIn an emotional and poignant interview on RTÉ Claire Byrne Live on Monday night the women talk about a daughter and sister, nephews and grandsons, plead for a new inquiry into their deaths and call for changes in the law to assist the families of victims of such family murders.Rejecting claims that the deaths were because of mental illness, Ms Connolly said “nothing in this country is going to change if we just throw a blanket on the inquest, a blanket of depression, and Clodagh, Liam, Niall and Ryan, their file is in a filing cabinet now with reference numbers and we still don’t know why”.They could not accept a psychiatrist’s diagnosis at the inquest of depression when he had been attending his GP for five years who never diagnosed him as depressed.She added: “He never missed time from work, he was never sick. He had a position of responsibility. He showed no signs of depression, he was out, GAA, football, out and about.”Ms Coll said her daughter confided in her and told her in February 2016, six months before they were killed, that her husband admitted he had been watching porn.He started to go to counselling, Ms Coll said “and then an issue arose in the school so his counselling sessions went from dealing with his porn addiction to his issues at school”.She added that “we do know now that we didn’t at the time that he was dressing in Clodagh’s underwear.“I mean Clodagh would never ever in her wildest dreams have thought of that, none of us would. We only found that out after the inquest. He said as well when I go back to school it will all blow up. What we don’t know. Was he going to face a grievance? If he was masturbating in the school well at the very least he was guilty of professional misconduct.

The Met Office announced on Twitter that “it’s offically the UK’s warmest winter day on record”, with a top temperature of 20.6 degrees at Trawsgoed in Wales.Three locations in Britain breached the previous 20-degree record. As well as Trawsgoed, 20.4 degrees was recorded at Northolt in Middlesex, England, and 20.1 degrees at Gogerddan, also in Wales.Scotland experienced its warmest February day on record last Thursday with 18.3 degrees in Aboyne, Scotland.Back home, Met Éireann forecaster Siobhán Ryan said the forecast for Monday had been for temperatures of 17 degrees in parts of the midlands and west, but she said the models do not always pick up the effects of sunshine on localised locations.She also stressed that Monday’s high temperature is not attributable to global warming and is more likely the result of the natural variability in the weather.Ms Ryan explained the higher temperatures are a consequence of a high-pressure area over continental Europe which is bringing up warm air from the Iberian peninsula.The weather will be pleasant for most of the country until Thursday when normal seasonal conditions will resume.

It still all feels a bit surreal to think that I threw a viable hand grenade across our garden.”Gardaí alerted the explosive ordinance disposal team from Collins Barracks in Cork and a bomb-disposal team using a robot and personnel wearing protective Kevlar suiting made safe the device which they confirmed was a viable explosive device.Mr Martin said he dreaded to think what would have happened if his young nephew had picked up the device thinking it was a toy.Gardaí have begun checking CCTV footage from houses in the area to try to identify who was behind the throwing of the grenade at the property."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806153.1551130720!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"at least six ministers should stay home this st patrick s day says fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May  and Leo Varadkar at the EU-League of Arab States Summit in  Egypt on Monday. Last week Mr Varakdar said contingency plans were in place to recall Ministers travelling abroad for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations. Photograph:   Stefan RousseauPA Wire \tThe Government decision to send all 15 senior Ministers abroad for the St Patrick’s Day Festival in the weeks before the Brexit deadline looms has been described by Fianna Fáil as rash and poorly thought out. The party’s foreign affairs spokesman questioned the rationale behind 11 of the 15 senior Ministers travelling to either the Americas or other long-haul destinations less than a fortnight before the critical March 29th deadline. He said at least six key members of Cabinet should have foregone the foreign visits and stayed in Ireland to prepare for Brexit. “I agree that St Patrick’s week is a very important time for Ministers to sell Ireland abroad and it has worked well.“But this is no ordinary year. Given the unique circumstances of Brexit, I really do not think that every Minister should clear out of Ireland,” he said. “At least half a dozens key members of the Cabinet should be around the place because Brexit is at such a delicate stage.”He said if an emergency situation arose there were key Cabinet members who would take at least a day to get back to Dublin.CriticismHowever, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney responded robustly to the criticism. His spokesman pointed out that such work during St Patrick’s week had helped boost Ireland’s trade with China from €100 million a decade ago to nearly €1 billion today.“This year the visits have been designed from the start with Brexit in mind,” said the spokesman.“Firstly, the Taoiseach will go to Washington DC for a very important bilateral with the US president. “Other senior Ministers are staying very close to home. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will be in the UK, our closest neighbour. “The Tánaiste will be out of the country for three days visiting our EU partners over St Patrick’s weekend and would have been in Brussels anyway for a meeting of foreign ministers on Brexit,” he said. Sinn Féin’s foreign affairs spokesman Seán Crowe said the opportunity for Irish Ministers to gain access and raise Ireland’s profile was unprecedented and very important.‘Easily return’“Mr Coveney and Mr Donohoe are both not travelling from Ireland and they can easily return if recalled. Simon Coveney’s trips are to Brussels, France and Germany, which make sense,” he said. Besides the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, other senior Ministers travelling to the US are Charlie Flanagan (New York) Simon Harris (San Francisco) and Michael Ring (Chicago). Chief whip Seán Kyne is visiting Boston while Attorney General Séamus Woulfe will be in Washington DC. Richard Bruton is visiting Canada, Joe McHugh will be in China, while Josepha Madigan will be in Japan and South Korea. Heather Humphreys is visiting Australia and New Zealand Eoghan Murphy will be in Argentina Shane Ross is in the United Arab Emirates Katherine Zappone will visit South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.Contingency plansIn what seems like a personal concession, the left-leaning Minister of State Finian McGrath is visiting Cuba, as well as Mexico. Last week Mr Varakdar said contingency plans were in place to recall Ministers travelling abroad for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations, in light of ongoing uncertainty over Brexit.But he said he himself was making “quite a short trip” to Washington and Chicago and believed it was an important time to go.“We have put in place contingency planning to recall Ministers from overseas if we need to. We have a backup plan,” he said.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollinsBut enough of the past.Stuffed on a massive feed of Seán Lemass, Éamon de Valera and the founding fathers of Fianna Fáil, the contented delegates sat back in their seats, popped a waistband button and prepared for galloping indigestion to return.The present day, not so palatable.Oh, but they could have feasted for ever on the songs and stories of the good old days (is there anything to be said for another quivery clip from Dev?) and never stopped swapping yarns of more recent nights when it felt like they owned the entire world and not just every sweaty inch of public space in the sprawling Citywest complex.Born to it, they reminded themselves on Saturday night with loads of stirring, comforting newsreel incontrovertibly placing their party – not those showy late arrivals from Sinn Féin – at the scene of the birth of the nation.“Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party.” That time-honoured slogan, with its well worn “An Ireland for All” tag line, was writ large on the platform when the current leader came to administer a dose of political reality after the nostalgic wallow.“Fianna Fáil – The Responsible Party. Tolerating Fine Gael in the National Interest” is what it should have read.This was the thrust of Micheál Martin’s message and also the main reason why his troops, despite all those soothing shots of history, were feeling somewhat dyspeptic at their 79th ardfheis.Keeping a Fine Gael government in power through a confidence-and-supply agreement is proving increasingly hard for them to stomach. They’ve tolerated two years of it now, and the thought of enabling a cast of cocky Blueshirt pups to run their country for much longer has them all feeling distinctly queasy.So in what amounted to a “bear with me” speech, Micheál had to persuade them to persevere, no matter how much it might stick in the craw. He told them he feels their pain and, if it’s any consolation, he would love to give Fine Gael the order of the boot. It’s in his power to pull the plug, but he can’t. The “massive risk” involved in triggering a general election while Brexit still remains such a threat to Ireland is too big a price to pay.“In normal times, there would be no question about what should happen to this government, but we have to accept the harsh reality of this very moment,” he told delegates, aware of the other harsh reality that if he doesn’t convince them to back his agreement with Fine Gael, they may pull the plug on him.National interestHaving spent the evening enjoying a “special 1919 commemoration”, Micheál plunged his audience straight back into history, invoking the names of the Fianna Fáil greats, from “the first chairperson, Constance Markiewicz”, to bolster his argument that they must do the right thing. “It’s a difficult decision for us, but it’s the right decision and it reinforces the fact that Fianna Fáil is putting the national interest first.”There was loud and virtuous applause from the faithful, who were really clapping themselves, their selflessness and commitment to country. Given their visceral hatred of all things Fine Gael, endorsing Micheál’s confidence-and-supply arrangement a little while longer was the most heroic thing these dyed-in-the wool Fianna Fáilers could do apart from dying for Ireland.This was only a one-day ardfheis, but one day is enough for anyone. It began with Cork TD Billy Kelleher plastering the long, private approach road to the hotel with election posters urging party members in Ireland South to vote for him in the forthcoming European election selection convention. He had more posters inside the building – full length and in your face.Micheál Martin said last week that he would prefer if Kelleher ran again for the Dáil instead of looking for a seat in Europe. He laughed off suggestions that his TD for Cork North Central had given a resounding two fingers to that suggestion.As for Billy, he acted the wide-eye innocent all day as smiling delegates sidled over to tell him he was an awful man altogether for putting it up to Micheál like that.An elderly man cornered him outside the session on affordable housing, grabbing his hand. “Jaysus, you’re a terrible hoor! Fair fucks to ya!” Billy looked at him. “Wha’? I thought everyone was putting up posters, like.”Old and youngThe 1919 commemoration was hosted by Éamon Ó Cuív, grandson of Éamon de Valera. Not that he makes a big thing about it or anything. Ronan McGreevy of The  spoke at length about the Seán Lemass tapes. St James’s Brass and Reed Band from Dublin and the Bishopstown sign-language choir from Cork performed the national anthem to mark its 110th anniversary.The hall was like a sauna, full to capacity, with disappointed delegates left outside. The audience profile was on the elderly male side of mature, although there was also a large contingent from Ógra Fianna Fáil, all dressed to the nines. There seemed an unusually high turnout of teenage girls wearing glittery mini-dresses, but they wandered by mistake into the aftermath of the leader’s speech while trying to find where Romanian crooner Ovidiu Rusu, was performing. (Upstairs. Sold out.)From our vantage high up in the back, the amount of bald heads and grey hair was striking. Younger colleagues were highly amused by the number of old flip-phones and Nokia phones in use in our vicinity.Sea of blueThe much sought after warm-up speech slot went to rising star Lisa Chambers, who is the party’s Brexit spokesperson. The Nokia contingent were mightily impressed, even though Lisa is from Mayo and they had taken to quietly exclaiming “Up the Rebels” every so often. She appeared on stage in a striking white dress (perhaps in tribute to the nurses). “That’s the Chambers one,” said one of the Nokia lads. “Oh, that’s right” said flip-phone. “A lovely-looking girl. I think she’s very good.”To underline the gravity of the message, Micheál Martin burst into the hall without the usual loud blast of young people’s music. But everyone cheered anyway when he raced on to the stage. He was alone. Alone in a sea of blue, which may have been a metaphor.As he neared the end, perspiring from the heat, we scanned the front rows for likely platform athletes. Kevin O’Keeffe for Cork East looked a likely contender, head shining and sweating up like a horse before a big race. Then Robert Troy from Longford-Westmeath pulled on his jacket, which seemed unusual.The speech finished. Robert shot like a bullet from his chair and tore across to the steps with about five female politicians in hot pursuit. In the blink of an eye he was at his leader’s shoulder. But he barely managed to clap him on the back before being mown down by the women and relegated to the back of the scrum.As Brexit bears down on history, Micheál will soon find out if being the responsible party resonates with the nation’s voters and if tolerating Fine Gael in the national interest secures his future in the Fianna Fáil interest."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806130.1551128472!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second referendum plan may not get commons backing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn:  reluctance around “public vote” helped to drive eight MPs out of the party. Photograph: Vickie FloresJeremy Corbyn’s decision to put Labour’s support behind a second referendum on Brexit is an important step towards giving the British people a chance to reconsider their decision to leave the EU. But with the overwhelming majority of Conservatives and a few dozen Labour MPs opposed to a second vote, it will struggle to win a majority in the House of Commons.Labour’s amendment on a second referendum will not be tabled until March 12th, when Theresa May hopes to bring her Brexit deal back to the Commons for a “meaningful vote”. On Wednesday, MPs will vote on an amendment that would enable them to compel the prime minister to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating period if she fails to win a majority for her deal by March 14th.Corbyn said on Monday night that Labour would back that amendment, which also has the support of a number of Conservative MPs including some ministers. Labour will also table an amendment outlining its own Brexit plan, which is all but certain to be defeated.Speaking to Labour MPs on Monday night, Corbyn pointed out that supporting a second referendum was in line with the policy the party agreed last September. But the Labour leader’s apparent reluctance to implement that policy, which calls for a “public vote” to be considered if all other options had been exhausted, helped to drive eight MPs out of the party into the newly formed Independent Group last week.Grassroots groupCorbyn’s move may have been motivated by the fear that other MPs were preparing to defect to the new group but it also reflects the views of most Labour members and voters. Younger Labour voters and members of Momentum, the grassroots group that supports Corbyn’s leadership, are particularly enthusiastic about a second vote.And although two out of three Labour MPs represent constituencies that voted Leave in 2016, only a handful are committed Brexiteers and a few dozen are adamant that the referendum result must be respected.The Labour amendment is likely to be based on one tabled by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson that calls for the prime minister’s Brexit deal to be put to a confirmatory referendum similar to that which followed the signing of the Belfast Agreement. Senior Labour figures said on Monday night that the choice would be between backing the prime minister’s Brexit deal and remaining in the EU, with Labour backing Remain."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster dog show 2019 pictures","story":"Wire fox terrier wins Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York on Tuesday night, emerging as the top dog among nearly 3,000 barking, tail-wagging competitors.Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn comes out for second referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels - even in event of no-deal BrexitOne in four teenage suicides involves the internet, official inquiry findsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winSubmarine hatches should be made bigger to accommodate obese people in the military following F35 announcement, peer suggestsChild Genius, review: like Slytherin v Millwall - you don\u0026#39t want anyone to winQueen to host reception to celebrate Prince Charles\u0026#39s 50th anniversary as Prince of Wales, palace announcesParents and MPs protest over \u0026#39state takeover\u0026#39 of sex education in schoolsBacking a second referendum is the ultimate \u0026#39dead cat\u0026#39 strategy for LabourNew England Patriots owner, Robert Kraft charged with soliciting prostitutionComment: Why women at the top should walk away when the work culture is toxicSixty Conservative MPs plan to force Theresa May to recognise legal rights of EU nationals in UKLabour warns it may oppose Sajid Javid\u0026#39s blanket ban on HizbollahDaughter of Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov working for far-Right French MEP in BrusselsComment: Britain risks its own national security if it leaves us Kurds in the clutches of Turkey\u0026#39s ErdoganEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/20/TELEMMGLPICT000159430519_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"forget benefits screen time truly modern must teach children","story":"Perhaps the most modern thing we can do is to teach our children to exist beyond the world of screensHow did you learn your times tables?

Experts have found dangerous diseases can pass from the livestock to humansA parasitic disease which affects more than 200 million of the world’s poorest people is transmitted between humans and their livestock through hybrid flatworms, a UK-funded project has found. Schistosomiasis, a chronic disease caused by parasitic flatworms which leads to an intestine or urinary tract infection, is common in communities without access to safe drinking water and sanitation.While efforts to control the disease have been partially successful, they have been limited by the flatworms ability to rapidly adapt and evolve. But in an announcement on Monday, scientists working in West Africa said that growing hotspots of the disease are driven by the emergence of highly infectious hybrid parasites, formed when species of schistosome from both livestock and humans combine. The research finding, which the World Health Organisation have incorporated into treatment guidelines, will have a significant impact on stemming the transmission and spread of the disease.“This finding is really important in terms of public health and demonstrates the huge potential for science to really make a difference,” she added.From animal to human | Ten significant zoonotic diseasesThe research is among a number of projects releasing findings on Monday as part of a UK government strategy to invest in zoonotic diseases, which can be passed from animals to humans. Such illnesses, which can devastate livestock and could be the source of the next global pandemic, are estimated to have cost the world more than $20 billion directly and $200 billion indirectly between 2000 and 2010.  “A billion people around the world depend on farming and livestock as a source of income,” said Penny Mordaunt, International Development Secretary.“By protecting cows and chickens from infections and tackling diseases that spread from animals to humans – like avian flu – UK aid is protecting them, supporting their livelihoods and reducing the risk of pandemics that could reach our shores.” In a project in Tanzania, scientists found that the insecticides farmers used to control ticks and flies on livestock also prevented the transmission of sleeping sickness, a deadly neglected disease spread by tsetse flies, from wildlife to humans. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleAnother team identified a link between growing brucellosis infections and the rise of farming sheep and goats, which are becoming more popular to farm as they are less vulnerable to changing climates than cattle. “But what we also know is that animals, both wildlife and livestock, are an important source of new infections to humans. How we invest overseas has an impact on the UK as well as global health security.”Dfid also announced on Monday an additional £2.5 million for six projects in the Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems (ZELS) scheme, taking the total invested by the UK to over £23 million. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn comes out for second referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels -

Defence sources said the seats had been designed to cope with the increasingly erse physical profile of modern aircrew.An RAF survey last year found 4,272 airmen and women classed as clinically obese, the highest level ever recorded.Health Minister Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford said: While I don\u0027t feel able to comment on ejector seats or submarine hatches... I do believe that obesity is a serious issue.Earlier, she had been pressed over steps being taken by the Government to ensure that people suffering from an eating disorder were able to access treatment and support.Lady Blackwood told peers: Eating disorders are life-threatening conditions and it is the priority of this government to ensure that everyone with an eating disorder can access quick, specialist help when necessary.She pointed to a reduction in waiting times for children\u0027s eating disorder services, while a review was being carried out to look at securing future improvements to adult facilities.Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Parminter, who raised the issue, said: Hospital admissions in the last six years have more than doubled whilst outpatient services for adults are under-resourced and they are unable to support people to be treated in the community.What is the Government intending to do to improve adult eating disorder services to treat these life-threatening severe mental illnesses.Lady Blackwood said: While we have made a lot of progress with children\u0027s eating disorder services we must not forget adult services.She highlighted a commitment to pilot four-week waiting times for adult community mental health teams.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that fitness standards in the Royal Navy had been maintained and there was no need, or plan, to increase the size of hatches on submarines as a result of personnel issues.  Ministry of DefenceIranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn comes out for second referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels - even in event of no-deal BrexitOne in four teenage suicides involves the internet, official inquiry findsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winChild Genius, review: like Slytherin v Millwall - you don\u0026#39t want anyone to winQueen to host reception to celebrate Prince Charles\u0026#39s 50th anniversary as Prince of Wales, palace announcesParents and MPs protest over \u0026#39state takeover\u0026#39 of sex education in schoolsBacking a second referendum is the ultimate \u0026#39dead cat\u0026#39 strategy for LabourNew England Patriots owner, Robert Kraft charged with soliciting prostitutionComment: Why women at the top should walk away when the work culture is toxicSixty Conservative MPs plan to force Theresa May to recognise legal rights of EU nationals in UKLabour warns it may oppose Sajid Javid\u0026#39s blanket ban on HizbollahDaughter of Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov working for far-Right French MEP in BrusselsComment: Britain risks its own national security if it leaves us Kurds in the clutches of Turkey\u0026#39s ErdoganEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitBritish Isil suspect \u0026#39goes missing\u0026#39 after being released in Syria amid row over returning jihadistsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/25/TELEMMGLPICT000172069027_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqniLs_ck1w-iIu15kYzVq2d6IZZiXNIhc2shoXJuYYgE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"unvaccinated french boy reintroduces measles costa rica","story":"Measles caused 110,000 deaths in 2017An unvaccinated French boy is suspected of reintroducing measles to Costa Rica after the Central American country had been free of the disease for five years.The five-year-old boy, who was on holiday with his parents, had never had a measles jab and the arrival of the highly contagious disease has sparked concern about the anti-vaccine movement.It is not clear why the child was not vaccinated.The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned last month that “vaccine hesitancy” was among the 10 most serious threats to human health.“Some countries that were close to eliminating measles have seen a resurgence,” the WHO warned.Agnès Buzyn, the French health minister, last year made vaccinations against measles and 11 other diseases compulsory for children.Ms Buzyn has made extending vaccination coverage one of her top priorities.Computer illustration of the measles virusMeasles caused 110,000 deaths worldwide in 2017, the WHO said, despite the widespread availability of a vaccine. The majority of those who died were children under five.The Costa Rica Star reported that neither the boy nor his mother, 30, had been vaccinated.The father, 35, is reportedly not up to date with his vaccinations. The newspaper said the parents told a doctor in Costa Rica that other children at the boy’s school in France had contracted measles.A spokeswoman for the French health ministry confirmed that a French five-year-old boy in Costa Rica was suffering from measles.She said the measles vaccination had only been compulsory in France for children born on or after 1 January 2018, and the boy affected was therefore not covered by the requirement introduced by the current governmentCosta Rican authorities said they had informed their French counterparts so that they can track whether others in France have been infected.Costa Rica has not had a domestic measles case since 2006. The last recorded case brought in from another country was in 2014.The boy is being treated and both he and his parents will be held in quarantine for at least seven days at the Monseñor Sanabria Hospital in the port town of Puntarenas, near the Santa Teresa beach resort where they were staying. The family arrived in Costa Rica on 18 February.Andrew Wakefield was struck off in 2010The Costa Rican health authorities are trying to establish who may have come into contact with the boy at the resort, on his flight, or at a hotel in the capital, San José, where the family spent one night.The Costa Rican health ministry said 26 people known to have had contact with family have now been vaccinated. In a statement, the ministry said: “Our country enjoys very good vaccination coverage in general. However, in order to avoid particular cases and their possible complications, it is important that those in charge of minors ensure that children have the complete vaccination scheme.”In Britain, a paper published by a doctor in 1998 linking autism with the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella)  raised anxiety about the jab.The doctor, Andrew Wakefield, was struck off the UK medical register in 2010 for dishonesty and failing to act in the best interests of child patients.Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn comes out for second referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels - even in event of no-deal BrexitOne in four teenage suicides involves the internet, official inquiry findsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winSubmarine hatches should be made bigger to accommodate obese people in the military following F35 announcement, peer suggestsChild Genius, review: like Slytherin v Millwall - you don\u0026#39t want anyone to winQueen to host reception to celebrate Prince Charles\u0026#39s 50th anniversary as Prince of Wales, palace announcesParents and MPs protest over \u0026#39state takeover\u0026#39 of sex education in schoolsBacking a second referendum is the ultimate \u0026#39dead cat\u0026#39 strategy for LabourNew England Patriots owner, Robert Kraft charged with soliciting prostitutionComment: Why women at the top should walk away when the work culture is toxicSixty Conservative MPs plan to force Theresa May to recognise legal rights of EU nationals in UKLabour warns it may oppose Sajid Javid\u0026#39s blanket ban on HizbollahDaughter of Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov working for far-Right French MEP in BrusselsComment: Britain risks its own national security if it leaves us Kurds in the clutches of Turkey\u0026#39s ErdoganEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/25/TELEMMGLPICT000081027736_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJGdLpwOZ4ig0u7Q-LAYH6owfdGBvGwA8F1nDt3KQV8A.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"women top should walk away work culture toxic","story":"Karren Brady has stepped down as chairman on Sir Philip Green\u0026#39s holding companyEver since The  brought to light the murky allegations about Sir Philip Green, Karren Brady’s position has seemed somewhat compromised.

But how much might shoppers be affected by increased tariffs, border checks and a weaker currency?Business groups have issued a series of dire warnings in recent days over how much more expensive food shopping will become after Brexit.The impact will vary across different ranges of products and depends on a number of factors such as how dependent the UK is on imports rather than domestic supply and the import taxes that will be applied by the UK government.Producers are likely to pass on additional tariffs to retailers and ultimately to customers but these vary considerably. Birds Eye’s UK and Ireland boss Wayne Hudson said that for his business, additional tariffs will range from 2 to 20 per cent, which he said will almost immediately be passed on to customers.Delays at at the Channel ports are also set to add to costs because of mandatory EU checks\u0026nbspon people and goods entering the EU from the UK. This will affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone because of the frequent and closed loop nature of the crossings, the Cabinet Office has said.Half of the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and during spring Britain is particularly dependent on imports of fresh fruit and vegetables because many are out of season in this country and must be imported from warmer climes.\u0026nbspAt this time of the year, around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from, or delivered via, the EU.World\u0027s food supply \u0027under threat\u0027 from loss of bioersityDespite Transport Secretary Chris Grayling\u0027s assurances that ports are ready for disruption, plans for additional ferry routes to ease congestion have not been successful, with only a fraction of the hoped-for capacity secured.\u0026nbspExchange rates are also likely to add to food costs if no withdrawal agreement is ratified. Economists forecast that the pound will fall sharply in the event of a no deal meaning less purchasing power, making imports more expensive. Much of this will filter through to higher prices on the shelves.It is not yet possible to quantify the exact effects of additional tariffs. We will know more\u0026nbspafter the Department for International Trade publishes a list of new import taxes that will apply to more than 5,200 products, including food.The EU imposes relatively high tariffs on some food products in order to protect European farming and food supplies. For dairy, the average tariff is more than 35 per cent while for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40 per cent.A number of hard-line Brexiteers have advocated unilaterally slashing UK import duties to zero in order to reduce prices for shoppers. Such an approach could mean lower prices for some products.But the zero-tariff approach has been ruled out by environment secretary Michael Gove because it is likely to have a disastrous impact on UK farmers. They have developed their businesses in the context of the EU’s customs union but would suddenly have to compete with cheap imports from around the world, including from countries which apply lower food standards that the UK.\u0026nbsp“One thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,” Mr Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference last week.Zero tariffs would not only hurt the UK food industry. Ceramic producers have warned that 22,000 jobs could be at risk from inexpensive imports, particularly from China.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal trade would fall back on World Trade Organization rules.This could mean for example, a 46 per cent tariff on mozzarella, 40 per cent on beef, 21 per cent on tomatoes and 15.5 per cent on apples, the British Retail Consortium has said.Every WTO member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries. While the average EU tariff is quite low, for food it is often relatively high.While the UK can lower its tariffs, under the WTO\u0027s “most favoured nation” rules, it has to offer the same raxes\u0026nbspto every member around the world unless it has agreed a trade deal with them.So far, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has only been able to secure deals with a small fraction of the UK’s trading partners.Analysts at Retails Economics predict that the cost of staples like beef and tomatoes could soar, with an extra £9bn\u0026nbspadded to the overall cost of food for UK consumers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

The vast majority of MOO’s sales are in the huge North American market, now accounting for 75 per cent of their revenues.In addition to its well known cards, the company’s range also includes hard- and softcover notebooks and business cardholders, among other things. Its London headquarters have recently moved from a warehouse in Shoreditch to a 35,000 square foot space down the road in Farringdon, which comes complete with an ice-cream machine, pool tables and a “library” – a giant bookcase, where MOO employees can bring in books to place on shelves.Created with Sketch.Hot desks: The coolest office spaces in the world Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.So it might be hard to imagine the first iteration of the business was a bit of a flop, with the company nearly dying in late 2005.What changed? A little creativity and a lot of persistence.Born and raised in north London, Moross, now 40, describes his younger self as more creative than studious.“It wasn’t like I wanted to be a policeman or a firefighter. I didn’t have a clear sense of what I wanted to do,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Retrospectively, it’s interesting that no one ever talks about becoming an entrepreneur at school. I remember doing career coaching and going to job fairs, and entrepreneurship was very underrepresented as an option,” he adds.Moross attended Sussex University to study philosophy and politics – a course he enjoyed, although he wasn’t inclined to make a career out of it. “I wasn’t interested in becoming a politician, and professional philosopher isn’t that much of a job,” he says.After a brief spell at the BBC he joined a startup called Sorted, a tool that told users about the hidden places – from coffee houses to bookstores – in their neighbourhood.The business eventually ran out of money and closed in 2001, prompting Moross to get involved with Imagination, a design agency.“What I loved at Imagination was working on big brands with smart people. But what I was missing in that role was being able to design products and make products better and more exciting. I didn’t want to do the campaign around the car, I wanted to make it.” he says.All of MOO’s products are sold via its websiteIt was 2004 when, during a sleepless night, Moross first had the idea to launch a startup selling paper cards. His first enterprise – the rather ambiguously named Pleasure Cards.“MOO was once Pleasure Cards. A great idea with a horrible name\u0026nbspthat didn’t work for all sorts of good reasons,” he admits.“The idea was to create a business card for your social life – to give out at a party, say, instead of in a business meeting.”Set up with £100,000 of seed finance from angel investor Robin Klein (who is still on the board of MOO today), the idea never took off.“By the end of the first year of business we were quickly running out of cash and people didn’t understand the concept. “I thought that instead of making these social cards, we should start printing for social networks, help people put their photographs on paper, give them access to design tools in order to make their brands look good.”The company was saved by a lucrative tie-up with photo-sharing website Flickr, which allowed users to print their pictures onto the business cards – sparking a lot of interest from investors.The promise of real revenue was enough to secure another £5m in investment and that was when MOO as we know it today was born.In the age of smartphones, the process of handing out a physical card with your information on it can seem remarkably outdated. But\u0026nbspthe digital revolution actually gave new life to one of the world’s oldest industries.Moross says: “Business cards might be 300 years old but without digital technology our business wouldn’t exist. We sell 100 per cent of our products through the website.”“MOO cards can also carry a different image on every single card, thanks to the digital printing press.“It show that, in a digital world, good quality physical objects still matter. Meeting someone is a much more special experience than receiving an email. When you meet in person, you want to be remembered and our hope is that our card helps you make that connection.”That is not to say that MOO has not made a few digital updates since its launch. In 2015, the firm released a new range of cards embedded with near-field communication technology that connects it directly to a web page or social media network when tapped with a smartphone.To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value. We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.MOO is also continuously trying to improve its green credentials and sticking its nose into the world of eco-friendly papers.In 2017, the company collaborated with Mohawk Fine Papers to take discarded cotton T-shirt scraps and give them new life as premium business cards.Usually, the scraps left behind from a T-shirt go to waste. But MOO takes these bits of fabric and uses a traditional printing technique to turn it into a high-quality paper.“To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value,” Moross says.“We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.“In the case of cards made out of cotton, many of our competitors already have eco paper – but we took one step further to create a new type of better quality green paper.”At about £14 for a pack of 50 original cards and £25 for a pack of luxe cards (printed on extra-thick luxury paper), MOO cards are a premium product. But they remain a cheaper option for those looking for customised business cards without the need to enlist a designer.“To some extent, if all you need is very cheap business card, you can just write an email to that person with your signature or write your number on a piece of paper.“But professional design is expensive and hard to access. So we talk about great design for everyone and we think about how to use technology to make the design cheaper and the software accessible or how we can help professional designers make their brand stand out.”A View from the Top: Jonathan Sattin, founder of Triyoga A View from the Top with insurance boss Amanda BlancA View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityWhen MOO was first founded, the team, which then consisted of just eight people, decided they would gather for a staff lunch on a weekly basis.Fifteen years later, the tradition endures, with employees being treated to free lunch every Friday.Moross, a keen photographer who has visited more than 60 countries, wants employees to have a life outside their jobs, believing this only increases productivity and creativity.“I tend not to work on weekends and I switch off very easily. You’re failing at your job if you’re 15 years in and you’re still working every hour of the day. You’re either failing at your job or you’re failing at your life and probably robbing your team of the things they could be doing.“I want people to come to work and be themselves. No one has to wear a suit and tie unless they want to, they can wear what they would at home – providing they wear clothes, of course.”Refreshingly, for a tech veteran who has little to prove to anyone, Moross can’t seem to rest on his laurels and is already looking to the next steps. “It’s always about pushing the business further. “This year, we’ll be expanding our product range and building much more for professional designers. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to building a good, strong, sustainable business.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.110 Lafy Gaga and Bradley Cooper perform \u0027Shallow\u0027A Star is Born actors Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed their Oscar-winning song “Shallow” at this year’s Oscars ceremony and set social media alight.Best Actor winner Rami Malek caused concern when he fell off stage after accepting his award.

It’s news that will also come as a significant disappointment to many. Alongside three wins in the technical categories – for Best Sound Mixing, Best Film Editing, and Best Sound Editing – Rami Malek also picked up Best Actor for his role as Freddie Mercury. - Clarisse Loughrey910 The Academy takes two steps forward for ersity, one step backFour years on from the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, and two years since the Academy took steps to rectify its predominantly white, male demographic by inviting 774 new members, it’s clear that progress has been made. Regina King won Best Supporting Actress for her role in If Beale Street Could Talk, BlackKklansman director Spike Lee finally won an Oscar after decades of snubs, and Black Panther’s costume designer Ruth Carter, and its production designer Hannah Beachler, both became the first ever African American winners in their categories.  - Alexandra Pollard1010 Richard E Grant wins hearts, even if he doesn\u0027t win awardsNo one has enjoyed awards season more than Richard E Grant. The 62-year-old star of Can You Ever Forgive Me? was, in his own words, “granted temporary membership to the A-list fame club” after the role earned him an Oscar nomination. Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.Tim Richards derisively described the film as a “made for TV movie” on account of its limited cinematic release.\u0026nbspHe said that it was still unclear\u0026nbspwhether Roma was screened on more than 13 UK screens at the art house Curzon Cinema chain, “representing less than 0.5 per cent of the cinema market” and for a week at the Filmhouse in Edinburgh.Richards went on to point to Bafta’s rules stating that: “Films should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards, and the film committee may not accept entries if they do not deem the theatrical release to be meaningful.Bafta decided Curzon’s screens made it meaningful enough.\u0026nbspI was raised by domestic servants like the one in RomaThe controversy is far from unique to the UK. AMC Cinemas and Regal, two major US chains, refused to play Roma as part of their best picture Oscar showcases and didn’t participate in its very limited US theatrical run because of the short window available before Netflix subscribers got their hands on it. Even the offer of cheap rentals couldn’t entice them.\u0026nbspMexico, the film’s home market, was not immune either. Cuarón went so far as to tweet his disappointment that it was showing on more screens in Poland than his native land as a result of big chains saying no.\u0026nbspBut are cinema operators right to draw a global line in the sand over the “theatrical window”\u0026nbspthat Richards says “has successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades and is one of the core differentiators that makes cinema unique”?How about asking yourself this: how many subtitled films\u0026nbspwould you normally expect to see at your local multiplex, regardless of how good they are?\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuaron wins Best Director for RomaArthouse cinemas are mostly where they live. Roma is different chiefly because it has an A-list Hollywood director and a distributor with enough cash to give\u0026nbspit an Oscar campaign.Awards films don’t always get much of a run even when\u0026nbspthey’re in English. My local multiplex, for example, supported If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspwith just one of its 14 screens for barely a week.\u0026nbspThe fact that I was able to catch it was greatly assisted by my having booked time off during that week.\u0026nbspRoma, by contrast, didn’t involve my jumping through any of the hoops families usually have to jump through when the parents want to see the sort of film they can’t take the kids along to. It was there, at my convenience, and it has remained in my head ever since.\u0026nbspIt’s the sort of film that does that.At the core of this controversy is a clash of business models, with Netflix’s desire to give its subscribers what it has paid for as soon as possible, clashing with the big chains’ demand for their cherished period of exclusivity.\u0026nbspBaftasAs ever, in these situations, the customer ultimately loses. I would still like to see Roma on a large screen and I would make the effort to do so, even after viewing it at home. The experience would be worth it.\u0026nbspRichards may be right to take shots at Netflix for scarcely making previous releases available for any sort of cinematic run at all, regardless of the window.\u0026nbspBut as regards the “window”\u0026nbspas a concept and the terms on which Roma was released, he’s on shakier ground. Note how he says the window has “successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades”. The problem is with that “many decades”. Things change.\u0026nbspSteven Spielberg takes thinly veiled shots at streaming servicesDespite people repeatedly calling its doom, the silver screen has adapted to a lot of changes, a bewildering array of them. It has weathered the emergence of TV, the widespread purchase\u0026nbspof home entertainment systems, video gaming, the internet, the explosion of choice in people’s leisure options.\u0026nbspIt can survive Netflix too, and cinemas’ rising global gross revenues\u0026nbspsuggests they are doing just that. I’d be willing to put money on their surviving shorter exclusivity windows for Netflix or for other films too.\u0026nbspThe latter’s customers, as a rule, tend to go to the cinema more than non-subscribers do anyway. They like movies. If they’re like me, they’ll often watch them more than once. But the first preference will always be to see them on the big screen, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Roma or Captain Marvel, about which my daughter and I are positively breathless in anticipation.\u0026nbspThe cinema offers an experience that Netflix cannot, and that is worth paying extra for.\u0026nbspThe disruptive threat Netflix poses is being felt much more by traditional television operators than it is by movie theatre chains.\u0026nbspNetflix needs to change its tune too though. It should be more open to giving more of its properties a cinematic release as Amazon, which admittedly has a rather different business model, has done very successfully.\u0026nbspSurely the various sides in this debate ought to be be capable of reaching a compromise? It should to be in their interests to do so. It would certainly be in the interests of movie lovers and movie goers and, well, art.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

But how much might shoppers be affected by increased tariffs, border checks and a weaker currency?Business groups have issued a series of dire warnings in recent days over how much more expensive food shopping will become after Brexit.The impact will vary across different ranges of products and depends on a number of factors such as how dependent the UK is on imports rather than domestic supply and the import taxes that will be applied by the UK government.Producers are likely to pass on additional tariffs to retailers and ultimately to customers but these vary considerably. Birds Eye’s UK and Ireland boss Wayne Hudson said that for his business, additional tariffs will range from 2 to 20 per cent, which he said will almost immediately be passed on to customers.Delays at at the Channel ports are also set to add to costs because of mandatory EU checks\u0026nbspon people and goods entering the EU from the UK. This will affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone because of the frequent and closed loop nature of the crossings, the Cabinet Office has said.Half of the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and during spring Britain is particularly dependent on imports of fresh fruit and vegetables because many are out of season in this country and must be imported from warmer climes.\u0026nbspAt this time of the year, around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from, or delivered via, the EU.World\u0027s food supply \u0027under threat\u0027 from loss of bioersityDespite Transport Secretary Chris Grayling\u0027s assurances that ports are ready for disruption, plans for additional ferry routes to ease congestion have not been successful, with only a fraction of the hoped-for capacity secured.\u0026nbspExchange rates are also likely to add to food costs if no withdrawal agreement is ratified. Economists forecast that the pound will fall sharply in the event of a no deal meaning less purchasing power, making imports more expensive. Much of this will filter through to higher prices on the shelves.It is not yet possible to quantify the exact effects of additional tariffs. We will know more\u0026nbspafter the Department for International Trade publishes a list of new import taxes that will apply to more than 5,200 products, including food.The EU imposes relatively high tariffs on some food products in order to protect European farming and food supplies. For dairy, the average tariff is more than 35 per cent while for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40 per cent.A number of hard-line Brexiteers have advocated unilaterally slashing UK import duties to zero in order to reduce prices for shoppers. Such an approach could mean lower prices for some products.But the zero-tariff approach has been ruled out by environment secretary Michael Gove because it is likely to have a disastrous impact on UK farmers. They have developed their businesses in the context of the EU’s customs union but would suddenly have to compete with cheap imports from around the world, including from countries which apply lower food standards that the UK.\u0026nbsp“One thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,” Mr Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference last week.Zero tariffs would not only hurt the UK food industry. Ceramic producers have warned that 22,000 jobs could be at risk from inexpensive imports, particularly from China.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal trade would fall back on World Trade Organization rules.This could mean for example, a 46 per cent tariff on mozzarella, 40 per cent on beef, 21 per cent on tomatoes and 15.5 per cent on apples, the British Retail Consortium has said.Every WTO member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries. While the average EU tariff is quite low, for food it is often relatively high.While the UK can lower its tariffs, under the WTO\u0027s “most favoured nation” rules, it has to offer the same raxes\u0026nbspto every member around the world unless it has agreed a trade deal with them.So far, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has only been able to secure deals with a small fraction of the UK’s trading partners.Analysts at Retails Economics predict that the cost of staples like beef and tomatoes could soar, with an extra £9bn\u0026nbspadded to the overall cost of food for UK consumers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phones are difficult to buy in some counties like the US, which has repeatedly said the phones are unsafe.But it said those same technologies that have proven so controversial – the 5G networks that it is looking to provide in the UK and elsewhere – mean that this phone is quicker than any other.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we can do that, then the whole thing will take off and there will be thousands of companies doing creative things.Blue Origin has already carried out several successful flights of its New Shepard reusable rocket and the company plans to use it to take people into space later this year.Despite similar ambitions by SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, Bezos insisted\u0026nbspat the New York event that it is not a race, stating, We will fly when we\u0027re ready.He also stated that his goal for Blue Origin is different to that of Musk, who has consistently said that he wants to send people to live on Mars.Musk even predicted last year that there is a 70 per cent chance that he would go to Mars himself. Bezos\u0026nbspsaid he had a different long-term vision for humanity, which involves moving heavy industry and energy production into space in order to protect Earth.My friends who want to move to Mars – I say, \u0027do me a favour, go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first, and see if you like it.

Notice anything about that sentence?\u0026nbspOr what about this, a brilliant snapshot of the works of TS\u0026nbspEliot by WH\u0026nbspAuden: “T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I’d assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.”As per the previous, it’s a palindrome, one of those weird and wonderful linguistic constructs that reads exactly the same backwards as forwards. There’s a letter in the dead centre (“I”), like a fulcrum, on which everything else hinges. The great French virtuoso Georges Perec (his parents were Polish), came up with one in French (“Le grand palindrome”) over 10 pages long. Eccentric, certainly, possibly mad. But what if all human history is like this, and with every step forwards we are just as certainly going backwards? Welcome to paleo world.Perhaps the best recent example of palindromic history is the fall of the Berlin Wall – after which all those bricks were neatly recycled to build other walls, and people are still calling a halt to government with a view to building another one, bigger and better than the last. Even though it’s going to be hard to beat the Great Wall of China. Or even, in its more modest way, Hadrian’s Wall, all designed to keep the barbarians at bay. Which is ironic, because we are the barbarians, gorillas who can hold a pen or a phone. The more sophisticated, the more primal. The more advanced, the more primitive. Behold, homo americanus, a species newly depicted in anthropologist\u0026nbspEmmanuel Todd’s vast and mind-expanding Lineages of Modernity: A History of Humanity from the Stone Age to Homo Americanus, which posits that “It is the very primitiveness of America that has made it successful.”I was reminded, reading a recent biography of the French anthropologist\u0026nbspClaude Levi-Strauss, how beautifully humbling anthropology can be, rather like looking out on the Milky Way on a cold, clear night. You think you’re you. But in reality you’re not. You’re just part of a massive system of interlocking parts, stretching across time and space. The very idea of the self is a product of society, designed to keep everyone going about their business. But it’s a delusion that works, as Todd brilliantly argues. It’s one of the great paradoxes of human evolution: the more we convince ourselves we are autonomous iniduals, possessed of free will and integrity, the more we are exemplifying an ancient zeitgeist.Created with Sketch.The fall of the Berlin Wall – in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989If you’re starting to feel just a little bit weary of economics, then join the club. It’s one of the oddities of capitalism that, just as in Marxism, everything has to be seen in terms of economics or freakonomics. As the Bill Clinton campaign had it, it’s the economy, stupid! But what if, fundamentally and looking at it from an anthropological perspective, it’s nothing to do with the economy after all, stupid? Economics is only concerned with the conscious, even possibly rational part of human behaviour. But there is a collective unconscious too\u0026nbspthat we generally forget about, or would like to forget about: notably the family, or (to speak like an anthropologist) kinship relations.The present no longer exists: How our brains aren\u0027t past NeanderthalEveryone has one. To begin with, anyhow. Even if, as in the case of orphans, it may not last very long. But everybody gets orphaned\u0026nbspin the end. You lose your parents. Or maybe your parents kick you out. Or your parents split up. Maybe you lose touch with your siblings (if you ever had any in the first place). Maybe it’s Cain and Abel. Maybe your father takes you up a mountain to sacrifice you to Yahweh (thus Abraham and Isaac).I’m trying to remember if my parents ever actually said to me, “You’re on your own, now, sonny Jim,” or words to that effect, but it was definitely implied. I was confronted with the anguish of liberty early on. “You want to be a vegetarian? OK, let me see, I think we have some soya here somewhere.” Or “So you’re an atheist now. Interesting!” Or “That’s fine, you don’t have to be a solicitor.” And, “She seems nice.”Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The idea that there is ‘no such thing as society’ could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind itThe nuclear family, in other words, is about as close to anything-goes anarchy as it is possible to imagine within a rule-bound, semi-protective environment (“Remember to look before you cross the street”). It’s why we hate anyone to be “controlling”. The typical western-style family is, in essence, centrifugal, designed to shove you out into the world, producing adventurers and explorers and entrepreneurs and philosophers, prodding and probing and shaping reality. Rugged, dynamic, creative inidualists, with women given (in the best case) equivalent status to men. Rather like the early nomads that spread out to populate the earth, rather successfully, pausing only to exterminate Neanderthals along the way.Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The very idea that there is “no such thing as society” could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind it. And this sense of being doomed to wander lonely as a cloud is nothing new. It is – as Rousseau would say – “the state of nature”, our primal condition. Technological modernity coincides with our archaic origins. We are still savages, operating very much along the lines of hunter-gatherers, Bushmen of the Manhattan savanna, equipped with socks and shoes and a Twitter account. All the trappings of so-called civilisation are paper-thin. Strip away Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, and we would soon be picking up rocks and making spears and looking for a woolly mammoth to take down.The Flintstones never really went away. Which is why we now have paleo politics (what Todd calls “primordial democracy”) in the shape of Trump and Brexit. Or, as the existentialists put it so neatly, hell is other people. Some degree of xenophobia or plain old misanthropy is built into inidualism. Paranoia is a by-product of liberty. You’re on your own now, like the three pigs, but you have to beware of the big bad wolf. So build those walls strong and high.William Golding’s classic Lord of the Flies tells the tale of a bunch of polite British schoolboys who, left to their own devices on an island, are soon killing and slaughtering and worshipping idols. But it’s not fiction. I know a guy, Sam Fussell, who dropped out of Christ Church Oxford, where he was studying English poetry, got into bodybuilding, and eventually went primitive in the wilds of Montana where he shoots wolves and bears – sometimes with a bow and arrow. And the odd thing is, I really like this guy. He is my avatar. He taught me to shoot and has promised to save a bullet just for me for when the going gets too tough. Fussell is the closest real-life counterpart, in my experience, to the fictional figure of Jack Reacher, the XXL vigilante hero of Lee Child’s novels. They are both variations on homo americanus. Which is probably our biggest export to date, an exemplary product of the Anglosphere, and legitimate successor to 200,000-year old homo sapiens. Together with the second amendment of the American Constitution and regular urban massacres.But as T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, pointed out, humankind cannot bear very much reality. We get protective, especially where our young ones are concerned. And this is where a different kind of family set-up stems from. Emmanuel Todd, who is a demographer as well as anthropologist, hit me with an amazing statistic. In Iraq, 35 per cent\u0026nbspof married couples are first-cousins (he reckons that this figure can rise to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin Pakistan). He finds that across vast areas of Eurasia, a different kind of kinship system has developed which is patrilineal and communitarian, with fathers transmitting power and property to sons and keen to see close relatives marrying. This leads not just to women being disenfranchised and segregated, but to the subordination of the inidual, social stasis and clan wars.of married couples in Iraq are first-cousinsThe powerful point that he makes, contrary to conventional wisdom, is that the more repressive, controlling, non-nuclear, more centripetal and inward-looking (or “endogamous”) family is not “primitive”, although it may well be medieval. It is the nuclear (and “exogamous”) family that is more primitive, more caveman, more nomad. The cosy-cousins family is a much more recent invention and should, to his way of thinking be deconstructed. We need to go more primitive, not less.If we consider, for a moment, the current political landscape in the UK, you would have to describe it as increasingly exogamous. Nuclear in the best sense. There seems no compelling reason why, like all good families, parties should not split apart. Schisms are probably a good thing. Better to be disunited if you’re only going to unite around something utterly dumb and dismal.If economics is conscious behaviour, and education and religion are our subconscious, then it is still family relationships that form the deepest level of our unconscious life. Hence it is around inidualism that the clash (or at least ergence) of civilisations will occur. Todd sets out a table in which different societies are compared in terms of their core values under various headings to do with attitudes towards equality, feminism, endogamy and\u0026nbspauthority. The “anthropological distance” between the Anglosphere and Denmark (hello, Danes!) is zero. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the combined distance from Saudi Arabia is 7.5. I think we can assume, in the aftermath of Khashoggi, that the Saudis don’t exactly prioritise press freedom. Todd offers an equation which explains 911: “Maximum incomprehension + intimate association  hatred.” On the other hand, we shouldn’t be so Russophobic. We are closer to Russia (1.5 distance) than Germany (2.5).But however inidualist, we are never going to give up the sense of wanting to belong. We all need a club to support (mine, for example, is West Ham, although if there was an East Ham team I’d probably support them, having been born in East Ham Memorial Hospital). Similarly, we readily fall back on the idea of a nation. It’s what makes the World Cup competitions so irresistible. The more global, the more tribal. It’s pure palindromic history. Even hunter-gatherers had to band together to bring down a mammoth. Doing something about climate control could be a great opportunity for collective effort. Our problem is we have never yet discovered a form of solidarity that doesn’t automatically encode a desire to annihilate the competition. Or as Todd puts it:\u0026nbsp“Group cohesion depends on hostility to other groups ... Peace is a social problem.”Emmanuel Todd is an anglophile Frenchman who studied in Cambridge. He reveres the British empiricists and fondly cites AJ\u0026nbspAyer’s Language, Truth, and Logic as a way of cutting through the French over-preoccupation with words. He also credits The Beatles with doing more to undermine the Soviets than the CIA. He tends to think of the European Community as a doomed and deluded project, “a rigid and hierarchical system”. In an almost scientific way, extrapolating from existing data, he is willing to offer a few predictions about the way things are going. I like his theory of zombie religions: “Protestantism and Judaism are dead even though they think they are alive.” In the future we can expect to see more feminism and a greater indifference to gender. But also less (in certain parts of the world). Hence more polarisation.The bifurcation of the sexes took place only a few billion years ago. If palindromic history is anything to go by, and the future increasingly resembles the past, we can expect to see a time when the sexes and sex will fade away. Kids will pop up out of vats and get to select their parents for a change and tell them what beliefs to adopt. Or we give up the notion of reproducing altogether. Finally the bubble bursts, light is extinguished, and the whole shebang folds up and shrinks into a lonesome, colourblind, extremely dense particle and we are crushed into a singularity. Even though there is no more “we”. Only “one”. And then none.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers. Now, the shoes have lost one of their main features and cannot be controlled in the way they are intended.The problems have led to a raft of one star reviews on the Google Play Store, as customers complain the shoes are crashing.Created with Sketch.Best vegan shoes for women Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials? Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child.

Downloading and applying that caused the Android app to break.The shoes do have manual controls, meaning that people can lean down and tie them up. But a large part of the functionality is built around the fact\u0026nbspthey can be controlled through the companion app, allowing for easy tightening when needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It would not be unfair to characterise them as dedicated Remainers pro-Europeans who have dedicated much of their political careers, in their respective former parties, to the European cause.Created with Sketch. Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.These billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThese billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThey would also, to a man and woman, warmly welcome any efforts to rule out a “no-deal” Brexit, and to postpone Brexit in any case. In this respect they share the instincts of many former colleagues in their old parties. In the words of Chris Leslie: “Choosing to stand by while our constituents’ lives and future opportunities are hurt by Brexit is a fundamental violation of Labour’s traditional values.”Debates about Brexit delay mean we’re missing the bigger pictureYet what might TIG do if a second referendum or a delay to Brexit – both it seems increasingly likely – was somehow not possible to achieve? Would they, when push comes to shove, back Theresa May’s deal over a no-deal Brexit – as logic would suggest? Or would they simply refuse to accept the choice as a genuine one and vote her deal down, if forced into such a dilemma? Might they have a free vote, each according to their own conscience?And if there was a Final Say referendum, what if Britain again voted to leave the EU? What then?More widely, in pursuit of their European beliefs, would TIG MPs be prepared to vote against the government in a vote of no confidence? The answer, as Heidi Allen told The Independent, is that they would not, because it might mean a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. But, on the other hand, that removes their negotiating leverage with Theresa May on Brexit she need not fear that they will eject her from Number 10.These sorts of questions, among many other tactical matters, is where differences of opinion will start to emerge – no doubt labelled “splits”. In future, particularly if they end up campaigning to re-enter the EU, TIG MPs will have more tense debates about having to adopt the euro, about the Schengen no-passport area, and about the UK’s contributions to the EU budget.Even so, the group’s 11 members have much more in common than points of difference, such as their enthusiasm for Europe. There is a reason, for example, why Ian Austin, an MP for Dudley, did not choose to join them when he defected from Labour – because he is prepared to support a version of Brexit and TIG is not.If and when the time comes for a general election, if the Brexit issue is still live, TIG will, with the Liberal Democrats, the nationalists in Scotland and Wales, the Greens and the Northern Irish republican parties, offer an unequivocally anti-Brexit, pro-second referendum, pro-Remain agenda.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Luckily we found out it was a spotted python so it was fine – it could have been worse.”Upon closer inspection by Scottish SPCA staff, the non venomous snake was found to have shed its skin during its 9,300 mile plane journey.“The snake is now in quarantine at our animal rescue and re-homing centre in Edinburgh,” said Taylor Johnstone, an animal rescue officer for the charity.Shaken up by her experience, Ms Boxall is considering whether she will ever return to Australia.Mr Airlie told ABC: “She said she’s not so keen to come back and visit. But I suspect she will – she’ll have to think about it at first.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

on Wednesday, with fog expected in the morning across England and Wales.\u0026nbspThe fog could cause disruption at roads and airports, Mr Burkill said.\u0026nbspIt will be a cloudier day than we\u0027ve seen of late, with temperatures, on average, hitting 15C\u0026nbspor 16C. That is still warmer than average for the time of year.\u0026nbspThe weather will become\u0026nbspless mild and more unsettled from Thursday, with some heavy showers possible.\u0026nbspTemperatures are likely to drop to 13C or 14C\u0026nbspby the end of the week.Additional reporting by agencies\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

Labour confirmed Remain would be on the ballot paper – but said it would not countenance\u0026nbspan option of a no-deal Brexit.Furthermore, the fear of another referendum may yet persuade Tory opponents of the deal to finally back it when the second “meaningful vote” takes place, probably on 12 March.Nevertheless, Peter Kyle,the\u0026nbspLabour MP who has proposed backing Theresa May’s deal subject to a referendum, said: “There\u0027s no going back on this now for Jeremy or the party.”No-deal Brexit an \u0027unforgivable act of self-harm\u0027 say UK insurersWhat is the Independent Group’s position on Brexit?Brexit ‘could trigger surge in animal testing’ as EU rules invalidatedAnother Tory signals she could leave her party over BrexitMr Smith said the referendum was a prize\u0026nbspworth grabbing for the Commons approving the stalled agreement.\u0026nbsp“It is the right thing to do for the country and for Labour voters,” he said.Clive Lewis, a shadow minister who warned support for Brexit would keep Mr Corbyn pout of power, said: “This decision is a hugely positive step for the Labour party and our movement as a whole.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said it could be a defining moment. We have long argued it is the right and logical thing to give the public the final say,” he said.The announcement came shortly before Mr Corbyn addressed the weekly meeting of Labour MPs, at which he was certain to face strong criticism about his confused stance on Brexit.At first, it was unclear whether Mr Corbyn was pledging to back a referendum on the prime minister’s deal, or only in the unlikely event of Labour’s own Brexit proposals being adopted.However, a briefing note for Labour MPs stated: “If our frontbench amendment does not win the support of the Commons this week, we will put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote.”Such an amendment “could be attached to the prime minister’s deal – or a version of it – should it win a majority in the House of Commons”.The sentence was a reference to the amendment put forward by Mr Kyle, and fellow backbencher Phil Wilson, for a confirmatory referendum.However, a Labour source said the party would not support the amendment in its current form, because “we will not be voting for anything which supports May\u0027s damaging Brexit deal”.It was unclear what changes the leadership would demand. Mr Kyle and Mr Wilson have argued that Labour MPs would not need to vote with the Conservatives, but merely abstain.The announcement drew some fierce criticism in the parliamentary Labour party meeting, the pro-Brexit John Mann telling Mr Corbyn: “In the Midlands and north of England this decision today will stop you from being prime minister. The price will be paid.”Earlier, speaking in Egypt, Theresa May suggested she could try to force her agreement through parliament before it had\u0026nbspbeen formally approved by the other 27 member states.Rejecting calls for a delay to Brexit, she said: An extension to Article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u0027t deliver a decision in parliament, it doesn\u0027t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word \u0027delay\u0027 says.”Ms May will make a statement to MPs on Tuesday, before the next round of Brexit votes – including on the cross-party bid to force an Article 50 extension if the deal is blocked again – on Wednesday.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela\u0027s president.According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela –\u0026nbspan effort that resulted in violence and several deaths –\u0026nbspwas Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Venezuela aid protests: Civilians demand food and medicine Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators push a bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators are seen through the cracked windshield of a torched bus A woman moves away from the flames of a burning bus A bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators push away a bus that was torched during clashes Demonstrators push a bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators are seen through the cracked windshield of a torched bus A woman moves away from the flames of a burning bus A bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators push away a bus that was torched during clashes On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators –\u0026nbspLibya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of\u0026nbspSirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi\u0027s\u0026nbspforces.Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.\u0026nbsp“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime\u0027s corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.\u0026nbsp“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”Trump could help Venezuela without invading – by talking to ChinaUS senator tweets apparent threat to Nicolas MaduroAt least 100 Venezuelan soldiers have fled to Colombia amid clashesPink Floyd\u0027s Roger Waters posts video of support to VenezuelaTwo killed in violent clashes over Venezuela aid suppliesMaduro breaks relations with Colombia as aid clashes continueMr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid.

His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela\u0026nbspsituation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted\u0026nbspthe 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Chinese ‘re-education camps run like concentration camps’After going on air at 7am to file his account of the trip, he decided to record the 8am replay.The video shows his TV in China going blank as he says: “One thing he might be expected by some in Muslim countries to raise would be the question of the camps in the far west of China. There’s up to...”Mr McDonell tweeted:\u0026nbsp”Here’s the moment China’s censors pull the BBC World TV feed this morning as I’m speaking about the visiting crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the possibility of him raising the mass extra-judicial detention camps holding many hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uighurs.”However another replay an hour later was not affected and ran straight through.“Maybe they were off making a cup of tea or fell asleep next to the big red censor button,” Mr McDonell said.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Chlamydia is extremely common. There were 208,755 new infections in England in 2013, and around the world an estimated 100 million are infected each year.2104 Sunshine boosts fertility by a thirdExposure to sunlight can boost the likelihood of a woman having a baby much as a third, according to scientists. Couples hoping to conceive may find that heading to sunnier climes may improve their chances, according to experts.You may think the time you spend slumped in your pyjamas watching cat videos online is wasted, but a new study has revealed that the funny clips have health benefits.  By watching cat videos, viewers boost their energy and positive emotions, and decrease their negative feelings, according to a new study from the Indiana University Media School.Steve JenningsGetty Images for Civic Entertainment Group4104 Cholesterol U-turn - fatty foods might not be bad for usThe US government has dropped fatty foods containing cholesterol - long thought to cause heart disease and strokes - from its list of \u0027nutrients of concern\u0027, following the publication of a new report. For 40 years, people have been warned against eating fatty foods containing high cholesterol, such as butter, eggs, red meat, shellfish and liver, because of supposed links to the substance in our blood.5104 Processed \u0027fruit\u0027 snacks contain more sugar than HariboThe vast majority of processed “fruit” snacks contain higher concentrations of sugar than a bag of Haribo, health campaigners have claimed.Researchers from Action on Sugar said that 80 out of 94 products surveyed contain more than 47g sugar per 100g, with some containing up to four teaspoons of sugar.6104 Spending half the day on your feetOffice workers should abandon their chairs for half their working day to reduce their risk of heart attacks, cancer, or diabetes, according to new guidance recommending people spend at least two hours – and preferably four – a day on their feet.7104 Turns out chocolate doesn\u0027t make you lose weightA journalist seeking to lay bare how the research behind fad diets can be “meaningless” and based on “terrible science”, has revealed how he tricked international media into believing that chocolate can aid weightloss. Posing as Johannes Bohannon, Ph.D, the research director of the fabricated Institute of Diet and Health, biologist and science journalist John Bohannon ran what he called a “fairly typical study” used in the field of diet research.A cancer vaccine that is tailor-made to work on inidual patients has come a step closer following a study showing that a prototype injection causes the complete control of aggressive tumours in laboratory mice. The therapeutic vaccine works by stimulating the body’s own immune system to identify and attack cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue unharmed.More realistic-looking brands of e-cigarettes may be less likely to lead people to quit smoking, according to a new study. In a year-long survey, researchers found that, overall, e-cigarette users were no more likely to quit smoking than non-users. However, nearly a third of smokers who used “tank”-style e-cigarettes every day quit smoking, compared with only 11 per cent of “cigalike” e-cigarette users, and 13 per cent of non-users.10104 Lariam: Hundreds of British soldiers suffering from mental illness after being given anti-malarial drugThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been accused of knowingly risking the mental health of its own soldiers after new figures showed that nearly 1,000 British servicemen and women have required psychiatric treatment after taking a discredited anti-malarial drug. Psychosis, suicidal thoughts, depression and hallucinations are among the mental-health problems associated with Lariam, also known as mefloquine. But the MoD has rejected all appeals to stop giving the drug to troops posted overseas – to the mounting fury of relatives, politicians and retired military figures who fear it could be responsible for an epidemic of psychiatric illness in Britain’s Armed ForcesThe mystery of what happens to make a knuckle crack has been solved thanks to a simple test of “pull my finger”. In a new study published by the University of Alberta, a team of researchers used MRI video to determine what happens inside a finger joint to make it “pop”. They observed that the sound is caused by a rapidly forming cavity inside the joint when pulled. “We call it the ‘pull my finger study’– and actually pulled on someone’s finger and filmed what happens in the MRI,” explained lead author Greg Kawchuk. More than just settling a scientific curiosity, the findings bring researchers closer to determining whether or not the ability to crack ones’ joints is inherent or even healthy. But they are still unclear as to why only some people can crack their joints on demand12104 Prescribing heroin to addicts could be more effective than methadonePrescribing heroin to addicts trying to beat their addiction could be cheaper and more effective than replacement therapy, an expert has claimed. Methadone, a synthetic opiate, is commonly used to wean people off the drug, while other patients are put through detoxification and abstinence programmes. But Professor Martin Schechter, from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, said there was “overwhelming” evidence that these standard treatments do not work for a section of addicts13104 Tanning beds can harbour herpes and faecal bacteriaIf the risk of cancer wasn’t enough to put you off UV tanning salons, an expert has now warned that the beds can host bacteria and viruses, including herpes. Sexually transmitted infections can be passed from person to person through unprotected sex and genital contact, and herpes can also spread to parts of the body where there is a cut or break in the skin, according to the Herpes Association.14104 DNA changes could explain why autism runs in familiesScientists have come up with a possible explanation for why autism appears to run in families – suggesting it can be triggered by changes in the chemicals attached to DNA. A study of sperm from 44 fathers of babies who showed early signs of autistic symptoms shows that “epigenetic” changes to the men’s DNA could transmit the condition to the next generation. Epigenetic changes involve modifications in chemicals attached to the DNA molecule – rather than mutations to the DNA sequence itself. The changes detected in this study have been linked with abnormal development of nerve cells in the brainScientists have broken new ground in the search for an Alzheimer’s cure, discovering a new potential cause of the disease, which it may be possible to target with drug treatments. Experts said the findings, from Duke University in North Carolina, USA, could “open new doors” in the increasingly frustrated global hunt for a dementia therapy.16104 1 in 3 women will get bacterial vaginosis but are unlikely to know what it isOne in three women will get bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of unusual vaginal discharge, at some time in their life. However, many women do not know what it is, and can confuse the symptoms for other conditions, such as thrush. Although the causes of BV are not very well understood, it develops when the normal environment of the vagina changes, when there are less of the normal bacteria (lactobacilli), an overgrowth of other types of bacteria, and the vagina becomes more alkaline.17104 Paracetamol can dull positive and negative emotionsA chemical found in paracetamol could dull emotional sensitivity, a new study has suggested. Paracetamol is commonly used as an over the counter drug to combat physical pain. However, researchers at the Ohio State University found acetaminophen, the main ingredient found inside it, also reduces how much users feel positive and negative emotions.18104 Drug made from cannabis could help fight severe epilepsyHope has been raised for children with severe forms of epilepsy that are difficult to treat after trials of a new drug derived from cannabis showed promise in helping to reduce the number of debilitating seizures suffered as a result of the condition. The study, published by the American Academy of Neurology, tested 213 people, ranging from toddlers to adults, who had severe epilepsy that did not respond to other treatments, using a drug made from a medicinal form of Marijuana.The gas can cause dizziness and affect an inidual’s judgement. It can also – in more extreme cases – cause unconsciousness and death from lack of oxygen.20104 New breath test could be used to detect stomach cancerCancers of the stomach could soon be detected using a simple breath test, researchers have said, potentially saving lives by picking up the condition early. A new trial of the tests, which measure the level of compounds in the breath that can point to cancer risk, have proved them to be accurate and cost-effective.21104 Eating cheese may help you lose weightA new scientific study has suggested that eating cheese may help iniduals struggling to lose weight – and contribute to keeping the pounds off. The Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry published a study this month that discussed the importance of something researchers labelled “cheese metabolism”. Scientists from the University of Copenhagen and Aarhus University compared urine and faecal samples from 15 men, who consumed a diet featuring milk and cheese or butter but no other dairy products for two weeks. The small test, which was partially funded by the Danish Dairy Research Foundation, found that those who ate cheese (or milk) during the trial had a noticeable different composition of bacteria in their gut22104 Prostate cancer detected by dogsNew research has supported the idea that dogs could one day be used to sniff out cancer, after a study found that trained German Shepherds were able to detect chemicals linked to prostate cancer from urine samples with incredibly high accuracy. A study carried out by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan had two German Shepherds sniff the urine of 900 men, 360 of whom had prostate cancer and 540 who didn\u0027t. One dog was successful at identifying prostate cancer in 98.7 per cent of cases, while the other dog achieved 97.6 per cent accuracy. It is the latest research in a series of studies stretching back decades, and boosts the hope that canines could help doctors identify various human cancers and diseases23104 Being pregnant like a youth serum for mothers-to-beBeing pregnant has a “rejuvenating effect”, acting like a youth serum on mothers-to-be, new research suggests. As people get older it becomes more difficult for the body to repair damaged tissue.24104 Marijuana can kill cancer cellsThe US government may be starting to officially recognize medicinal benefits of marijuana, as a government-funded research group has released a report claiming that weed can kill cancer cells. The Daily Caller reported the National Institute on Drug Abuse has issued a report that recognizes potential medical benefits of marijuana, something the US government has rejected in its classification of pot as a Schedule I drug – along with heroin, LSD and ecstasyMaps pinpointing where the country’s loneliest people might live must be used to help focus services to those who are most isolated, according to a new report. The Campaign to End Loneliness, which compiled the report with the University of Kent, warned as it released the document that loneliness and isolation are as harmful to our long-term health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. It can also put people at risk of developing dementia, high blood pressure and depression. As many as ten per cent of the older population all or most of the time, according to the charity. And people experiencing severe loneliness may in turn put a strain on the NHS and loved ones, as they are more likely to visit their GP more often, and enter residential care earlier.26104 Short people at greater risk of heart attackShort people are at a greater risk of heart attack – and there\u0027s little they can do about it because the link is genetic. For 60 years scientists had noted a correlation between height and coronary heart disease, which kills 73,000 people a year in the UK.A new type of HIV treatment involving the transfusion of a synthetic antibody designed to prevent the virus from attacking human cells has shown startling trial results. Patients injected with the antibody saw a 300-fold reduction in their viral “load” – the amount of HIV circulating in their blood. The antibody has been specifically designed to block the key viral protein receptor needed to infect human blood cells.28104 Psychedelic drugs could actually help solve addictionThe use of psychedelic drugs is as safe as riding a bike or playing football, according to the heads of a drug research organisation. Scientists say bans on drugs such as magic mushrooms and MDMA are inconsistent with human rights and psychedelic drugs are much less harmful to inidual users and society compared to alcohol and other controlled substances.29104 Low levels of salt in your diet might actually be dangerousFor years, the federal government has advised Americans that they are eating too much salt, and that this excess contributes yearly to the deaths of tens of thousands of people. But unknown to many shoppers urged to buy foods that are “low sodium” and “low salt,” this longstanding warning has come under assault by scientists who say that typical American salt consumption is without risk. Moreover, according to studies published in recent years by pillars of the medical community, the low levels of salt recommended by the government might actually be dangerousFemale life expectancy has dropped dramatically as older women reap the rewards of lifestyle choices that have seen them drink and smoke regularly. For the first time since 1995 the average life expectancy for women aged 65, 75, 85, and 95 fell in 2012, according to a government report31104 Energy drinks fuelling rise in bad behaviourCaffeine-packed energy drinks are fuelling a rise in bad behaviour in the classroom as youngsters consume excessive amounts of these “readily available legal highs” that could even encourage use of illegal drugs, campaigners warn. Teens are using the drinks to enable them to stay up until the early hours of the morning and then drink two or three cans filled with sugar and caffeine on the way to school to make up for their lack of sleep, said Chris Keates, general secretary of teaching union NASUWT. “This is the first time we have seen a significant number of teachers beginning to raise this as a concern,” he addedEating four eggs a week reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by a third, whilst consuming high fat dairy products can also lower your risk levels. A University of Eastern Finland led study has demonstrated that men who ate four eggs a week had a 37 per cent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who ate just one.Neilson BarnardGetty Images for The New York Culinary Experience34104 One in 20 UK parents thinks a packet of crisps countsAccording to a profoundly disheartening survey by Fruit Heroes, one in 20 parents consider crisps one of the day\u0027s much-vaunted five healthy things, and one in 10 don\u0027t believe eating fruit is good for you35104 Three year waits for childrenChildren with mental health problems can wait for more than three years to be assessed and up to nearly two years to receive treatment, according to a report. The number of children being sent to mental health service rose by more than 6 per cent between 2013 and 201436104 \u0027Homeopathy is no more effective than placebo\u0027Homeopathic remedies are “no more effective than placebo” in treating health problems, new research shows. The alternative medicine does not cure any conditions that are chronic, serious or could become serious – according to an assessment by the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia.37104 Sugar tax could save millionsA tax on sugary drinks could dramatically cuts cases of diabetes, heart disease and bowel cancer, and save the NHS millions every year, children’s health campaigners have claimed. As well as bringing in revenue for the Treasury, a tax of 20 pence on every litre of sugary drink sold in England could also save the NHS £15m a year, research by the Children’s Food Campaign (CFC) said.38104 Dementia risk can be reduced by improving lifestyleDoctors have the first conclusive proof that changes to lifestyle among the over-60s can slow mental decline – raising the prospects of dementia prevention programmes that cut your risk of the disease. The results are significant, as it is believed to be the first randomised and controlled trial to conclusively demonstrate that keeping the body healthy in later life also benefits the brain39104 Flu is much less common than you might thinkAdults over the age of 30 typically get flu about twice every 10 years whereas children contract the infection once every two years on average, a study has revealed40104 You\u0027re just like your fatherGenes from your father are more dominant than those inherited from your mother, new research has shown. All mammals are likely to use the majority of genetic material passed down from males, even if offspring look and act more like the mother, according to the study on lab mice by University of North Carolina’s School of Medicine41104 Scientists hail discovery of HIV pillA daily pill that can dramatically cut a person’s risk of contracting HIV must be made available through the NHS “as soon as possible”, campaigners have said. Results of a major UK trial of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have been described as “extremely exciting” and a “game-changer” by leading specialists.42104 Long sleep linked to strokesPeople who sleep for more than eight hours a day are more likely to have a stroke, research has shown – but experts do not know the reason why. A study of nearly 10,000 people carried out at the University of Cambridge found that those who took eight hours on average had a 46 per cent higher than average risk of having a stroke43104 Lung cancer breathalyser to go on trial in NHS hospitals by summer 2015 A new device that could detect lung cancer from a patient\u0027s breath is about to undergo clinical trials in NHS hospitals. The Lung Cancer Indicator Detection (LuCID) device could be made available to GPs within the next two years.44104 Almost a quarter of new psychosis cases linked to strong \u0027skunk like\u0027 cannabisPeople who smoke super-strength cannabis are three times more likely to develop psychosis than people who have never tried the drug – and five times more likely if they smoke it every day. Why cannabis studies are needed45104 Scientists attempt to artificially copy polio virusScientists are attempting to create a cure for polio by creating a synthetic version of the dealy disease. Poliomyelitis, an infectious disease which can permanently paralyse or even kill its victims, affects approximately hundreds each year as efforts by international aid organisations show promise.46104 Fastest rise in scarlet fever cases for half a centuryBritain is facing an outbreak of scarlet fever, with infection rates rising rapidly and the disease spreading faster than at any time in half a century. More than 300 new cases of the bacterial infection were reported in England last week, with 1,265 cases registered since the beginning of the year.47104 Fears that e-cigarettes are gateway drug as vaping outstrips puffingTwice as many young teenagers are using e-cigarettes than conventional cigarettes – and a significant proportion of them are getting their first taste of nicotine from “vaping” rather than smoking, a study has found. The findings have raised concerns among some experts that e-cigarettes, widely viewed as harmless to health, could be introducing children to the risk of nicotine addiction at an early age and so act as a “gateway” to smoking48104 HRT can increase a woman\u0027s chances of developing ovarian cancerWomen going through the menopause who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are putting themselves at a greater risk of ovarian cancer, Oxford University researchers have said. Their findings, based on a major review of virtually all existing evidence, suggest the dangers are slightly greater than previously thought, but experts said there was no reason for women to stop taking HRT49104 Tests begin on \u0027traffic light pacemaker\u0027 that could revolutionise heart treatment Scientists are to begin work on a revolutionary “traffic light pacemaker” that controls the beating of damaged hearts using blue and yellow fibre optic lights inside the body. Heart attacks and other major cardiac problems can damage the heart muscle, leaving patients vulnerable to dangerous disruptions in the heart’s rhythm – known as arrhythmia – often leading to heart failure. Researchers are exploring whether stem cell-generated heart cells could be implanted to regenerate the damaged areas. But progress has been held back because tests in the laboratory and in a small number of patients have shown that new tissue often fails to beat in time with the remaining healthy heart muscle50104 Smokers have thinner brain cortex and could have impaired thinkingA key part of the brain that is needed for thinking skills is smaller in smokers, new research has found. The findings show that smoking has an impact on brain functioning — as well as the heart and lungs. The outer brain layer or brain cortex is thinner in smokers, researchers have found. And while some of the thickness might come back after they quit, that might not happen51104 Drinking red wine could help overweight people burn fat Drinking red wine could help overweight people burn fat better and improve liver function, scientists in the US have claimed. Authors of a new study cautioned that the effects found would not stretch to weight loss and that the same compounds could be consumed by eating certain red grapes or drinking their juice52104 Common cold \u0027could be stopped in its tracks\u0027 thanks to science breakthrough The common cold could be a thing of the past, as scientists have found a way to jam the genetic code. The breakthrough means in the future, it could be possible to stop virus molecules replicating, by stopping them conveying the instructions needed to copy themselves.Green tea may help kick-start cycles of cancerous cell death while leaving healthy ones alone, scientists have claimed. A compound found in the tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate – or EGCG – could trigger a process of destroying malignant cells, researchers at Penn State’s Center for Plant and Mushroom Foods for Health have found54104 Double chins could be \u0027cured\u0027 without surgery or dieting using new injectionA treatment that promises to reduce double chins through a so-called fatburner injection could soon be on offer to the public. By injecting a specially formulated chemical known as ATX-101 into the skin, fat cells beneath the skin known as submental fat are removed.55104 Cannabis eases chronic pain better than commonly prescribed opioidsResearchers from the Australian National Drug and Alcohol centre found that patients with chronic pain who used the drug said it eased their symptoms better opioid medications, which are highly addictive and can cause accidental overdosesAlmost 500 newly identified cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) were reported by hospitals across England in one month, according to the latest figures. Despite the apparently high number of FGM cases, no one has yet been convicted for the practice, which has been illegal in the UK since 1985Campaigners are taking selfies of lipstick smudged across their faces after their smear tests to raise awareness over the importance of early cervical cancer detection58104 Plain packets to be soldThe Government has finally decided that cigarettes are to be sold in standardised packages in England. Jane Ellison, the public health minister, told the Commons that regulations would be put to a free vote before Parliament breaks up for the general election in May. The regulations could come into force next year.One of the most common sexual positions has also been dubbed the most dangerous by scientists. The woman-on-top position during intercourse was deemed responsible for half of all penile fractures sustained during sex in cases recorded at three hospitals, according to researchers in Brazil60104 Women may experience more pain during childbirth if their partner is presentFor many, the role of the expectant father is to provide comfort, reassurance and assistance to their partner at childbirth. A new study however has suggested they may be better off considering to stay well away from the delivery room as their presence could make the process of giving birth more painful.61104 Lie-in could lead obesity and diabetesPeople who find it difficult to get out of bed at the weekends are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems such as obesity and diabetes compared to iniduals who are up with the lark even when they do not have to go to work, a study has found62104 Dentists breach NHS rules with unclear pricing and guidanceSome NHS dentists are breaching rules by failing to offer clear pricing information and automatically offering private treatment – potentially resulting in patients being overcharged, an investigation has revealed63104 A drink a night \u0027is better for your heartIn what may prove to be badly timed news for those struggling to observe “dry January”, scientists have discovered that having up to seven drinks a week may give you a better chance of avoiding heart failure than people who abstain from alcohol completely. A study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that in middle-aged men, drinking up to seven small glasses of wine or about three and a half pints of beer a week was associated with a 20 per cent lower risk of developing heart failure when compared with teetotallersA record 2.5 million people are now living with cancer or the after-effects of it, threatening “a crisis of unmanageable proportions” for the NHS, a leading charity has warned.Waiting times in NHS accident and emergency (A\u0026ampE) departments across England are at their worst in a decade. Figures released show emergency units are failing to see 95 per cent of patients within four-hour target.In findings which they say “give credence” to countless maternal warnings about wearing a scarf, experts at Yale University found that viruses that cause the common cold replicate more effectively at the lower temperatures encountered in the extremities of the body – such as the nose.Bodies do less work when eating foods that have been softened by cooking - so we keep more of the calories. Stale foods like day-old cooked spaghetti, or\u0026nbsppizza, will give you fewer calories than the same foods eaten piping hot.A senior science adviser has warned that plans to allow the creation of so-called “three-parent” in vitro fertilisation (IVF) babies as early as next year are premature because of unresolved safety concerns about the future health of the children69104 Intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) drug to help paralysed peopleA drug that could eventually help paralysed people regain muscle movement – and possibly even walk again – has been discovered by scientists in the USAScientists have discovered a gene that protects people from the most common cause of stroke in young and middle-aged people. The gene, which was isolated by studying the DNA of nearly 16,000 patients across the USA and Europe, also reduces the risk of migraines and could lower heart attack risk71104 Mediterranean diet to combat obesityIt’s long been known that a Mediterranean diet is linked to a longer life – but it could make for a slimmer one too.72104 Crying is good for youIf you’ve ever thought it strange that you cry when you’re happy, then you’re not alone - but now scientists have discovered that tears are actually a logical response to joy. A Yale psychologist has carried out a series of studies which show that crying is the body’s way of “restoring emotional equilibrium” during a period of intense feeling73104 HIV could help cure cancerA man suffering with an aggressive form of leukaemia is now in remission after doctors used the HIV virus to target and kill cancer cells. The treatment is the result of two decades of research by Dr Carl June and his team at Penn Medicine, who produced a study on the “leukaemia-specific killers”The official advice from the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) states in its guidelines that women should avoid alcohol altogether during pregnancy, or that if they do choose to drink, it should be no more than one or two units of alcohol once or twice a week75104 A new virus that could make you stupidA new virus has been discovered, but rather than giving you a sore throat, it affects a very different part of the body. According to scientists in the US, the algae virus affects the human brain, and can impair our cognitive functions. Scientists are basically saying there’s something we can catch that will make us stupidA new strain of the sexually transmitted disease (STD) gonorrhoea which is resistant to a range of antibiotics has been identified in Australia. Known among scientists as A8806, the strain was discovered late last year in a European woman who was travelling in Australia.

The therapeutic vaccine works by stimulating the body’s own immune system to identify and attack cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue unharmed.More realistic-looking brands of e-cigarettes may be less likely to lead people to quit smoking, according to a new study. In a year-long survey, researchers found that, overall, e-cigarette users were no more likely to quit smoking than non-users. However, nearly a third of smokers who used “tank”-style e-cigarettes every day quit smoking, compared with only 11 per cent of “cigalike” e-cigarette users, and 13 per cent of non-users.10104 Lariam: Hundreds of British soldiers suffering from mental illness after being given anti-malarial drugThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been accused of knowingly risking the mental health of its own soldiers after new figures showed that nearly 1,000 British servicemen and women have required psychiatric treatment after taking a discredited anti-malarial drug. Psychosis, suicidal thoughts, depression and hallucinations are among the mental-health problems associated with Lariam, also known as mefloquine. But the MoD has rejected all appeals to stop giving the drug to troops posted overseas – to the mounting fury of relatives, politicians and retired military figures who fear it could be responsible for an epidemic of psychiatric illness in Britain’s Armed ForcesThe mystery of what happens to make a knuckle crack has been solved thanks to a simple test of “pull my finger”. In a new study published by the University of Alberta, a team of researchers used MRI video to determine what happens inside a finger joint to make it “pop”. They observed that the sound is caused by a rapidly forming cavity inside the joint when pulled. “We call it the ‘pull my finger study’– and actually pulled on someone’s finger and filmed what happens in the MRI,” explained lead author Greg Kawchuk. More than just settling a scientific curiosity, the findings bring researchers closer to determining whether or not the ability to crack ones’ joints is inherent or even healthy. But they are still unclear as to why only some people can crack their joints on demand12104 Prescribing heroin to addicts could be more effective than methadonePrescribing heroin to addicts trying to beat their addiction could be cheaper and more effective than replacement therapy, an expert has claimed. Methadone, a synthetic opiate, is commonly used to wean people off the drug, while other patients are put through detoxification and abstinence programmes. But Professor Martin Schechter, from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, said there was “overwhelming” evidence that these standard treatments do not work for a section of addicts13104 Tanning beds can harbour herpes and faecal bacteriaIf the risk of cancer wasn’t enough to put you off UV tanning salons, an expert has now warned that the beds can host bacteria and viruses, including herpes. Sexually transmitted infections can be passed from person to person through unprotected sex and genital contact, and herpes can also spread to parts of the body where there is a cut or break in the skin, according to the Herpes Association.14104 DNA changes could explain why autism runs in familiesScientists have come up with a possible explanation for why autism appears to run in families – suggesting it can be triggered by changes in the chemicals attached to DNA. A study of sperm from 44 fathers of babies who showed early signs of autistic symptoms shows that “epigenetic” changes to the men’s DNA could transmit the condition to the next generation. Epigenetic changes involve modifications in chemicals attached to the DNA molecule – rather than mutations to the DNA sequence itself. The changes detected in this study have been linked with abnormal development of nerve cells in the brainScientists have broken new ground in the search for an Alzheimer’s cure, discovering a new potential cause of the disease, which it may be possible to target with drug treatments. Experts said the findings, from Duke University in North Carolina, USA, could “open new doors” in the increasingly frustrated global hunt for a dementia therapy.16104 1 in 3 women will get bacterial vaginosis but are unlikely to know what it isOne in three women will get bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of unusual vaginal discharge, at some time in their life. However, many women do not know what it is, and can confuse the symptoms for other conditions, such as thrush. Although the causes of BV are not very well understood, it develops when the normal environment of the vagina changes, when there are less of the normal bacteria (lactobacilli), an overgrowth of other types of bacteria, and the vagina becomes more alkaline.17104 Paracetamol can dull positive and negative emotionsA chemical found in paracetamol could dull emotional sensitivity, a new study has suggested. Paracetamol is commonly used as an over the counter drug to combat physical pain. However, researchers at the Ohio State University found acetaminophen, the main ingredient found inside it, also reduces how much users feel positive and negative emotions.18104 Drug made from cannabis could help fight severe epilepsyHope has been raised for children with severe forms of epilepsy that are difficult to treat after trials of a new drug derived from cannabis showed promise in helping to reduce the number of debilitating seizures suffered as a result of the condition. The study, published by the American Academy of Neurology, tested 213 people, ranging from toddlers to adults, who had severe epilepsy that did not respond to other treatments, using a drug made from a medicinal form of Marijuana.The gas can cause dizziness and affect an inidual’s judgement. It can also – in more extreme cases – cause unconsciousness and death from lack of oxygen.20104 New breath test could be used to detect stomach cancerCancers of the stomach could soon be detected using a simple breath test, researchers have said, potentially saving lives by picking up the condition early. A new trial of the tests, which measure the level of compounds in the breath that can point to cancer risk, have proved them to be accurate and cost-effective.21104 Eating cheese may help you lose weightA new scientific study has suggested that eating cheese may help iniduals struggling to lose weight – and contribute to keeping the pounds off. The Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry published a study this month that discussed the importance of something researchers labelled “cheese metabolism”. Scientists from the University of Copenhagen and Aarhus University compared urine and faecal samples from 15 men, who consumed a diet featuring milk and cheese or butter but no other dairy products for two weeks. The small test, which was partially funded by the Danish Dairy Research Foundation, found that those who ate cheese (or milk) during the trial had a noticeable different composition of bacteria in their gut22104 Prostate cancer detected by dogsNew research has supported the idea that dogs could one day be used to sniff out cancer, after a study found that trained German Shepherds were able to detect chemicals linked to prostate cancer from urine samples with incredibly high accuracy. A study carried out by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan had two German Shepherds sniff the urine of 900 men, 360 of whom had prostate cancer and 540 who didn\u0027t. One dog was successful at identifying prostate cancer in 98.7 per cent of cases, while the other dog achieved 97.6 per cent accuracy. It is the latest research in a series of studies stretching back decades, and boosts the hope that canines could help doctors identify various human cancers and diseases23104 Being pregnant like a youth serum for mothers-to-beBeing pregnant has a “rejuvenating effect”, acting like a youth serum on mothers-to-be, new research suggests. As people get older it becomes more difficult for the body to repair damaged tissue.24104 Marijuana can kill cancer cellsThe US government may be starting to officially recognize medicinal benefits of marijuana, as a government-funded research group has released a report claiming that weed can kill cancer cells. The Daily Caller reported the National Institute on Drug Abuse has issued a report that recognizes potential medical benefits of marijuana, something the US government has rejected in its classification of pot as a Schedule I drug – along with heroin, LSD and ecstasyMaps pinpointing where the country’s loneliest people might live must be used to help focus services to those who are most isolated, according to a new report. The Campaign to End Loneliness, which compiled the report with the University of Kent, warned as it released the document that loneliness and isolation are as harmful to our long-term health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. It can also put people at risk of developing dementia, high blood pressure and depression. As many as ten per cent of the older population all or most of the time, according to the charity. And people experiencing severe loneliness may in turn put a strain on the NHS and loved ones, as they are more likely to visit their GP more often, and enter residential care earlier.26104 Short people at greater risk of heart attackShort people are at a greater risk of heart attack – and there\u0027s little they can do about it because the link is genetic. For 60 years scientists had noted a correlation between height and coronary heart disease, which kills 73,000 people a year in the UK.A new type of HIV treatment involving the transfusion of a synthetic antibody designed to prevent the virus from attacking human cells has shown startling trial results. Patients injected with the antibody saw a 300-fold reduction in their viral “load” – the amount of HIV circulating in their blood. The antibody has been specifically designed to block the key viral protein receptor needed to infect human blood cells.28104 Psychedelic drugs could actually help solve addictionThe use of psychedelic drugs is as safe as riding a bike or playing football, according to the heads of a drug research organisation. Scientists say bans on drugs such as magic mushrooms and MDMA are inconsistent with human rights and psychedelic drugs are much less harmful to inidual users and society compared to alcohol and other controlled substances.29104 Low levels of salt in your diet might actually be dangerousFor years, the federal government has advised Americans that they are eating too much salt, and that this excess contributes yearly to the deaths of tens of thousands of people. But unknown to many shoppers urged to buy foods that are “low sodium” and “low salt,” this longstanding warning has come under assault by scientists who say that typical American salt consumption is without risk. Moreover, according to studies published in recent years by pillars of the medical community, the low levels of salt recommended by the government might actually be dangerousFemale life expectancy has dropped dramatically as older women reap the rewards of lifestyle choices that have seen them drink and smoke regularly. For the first time since 1995 the average life expectancy for women aged 65, 75, 85, and 95 fell in 2012, according to a government report31104 Energy drinks fuelling rise in bad behaviourCaffeine-packed energy drinks are fuelling a rise in bad behaviour in the classroom as youngsters consume excessive amounts of these “readily available legal highs” that could even encourage use of illegal drugs, campaigners warn. Teens are using the drinks to enable them to stay up until the early hours of the morning and then drink two or three cans filled with sugar and caffeine on the way to school to make up for their lack of sleep, said Chris Keates, general secretary of teaching union NASUWT. “This is the first time we have seen a significant number of teachers beginning to raise this as a concern,” he addedEating four eggs a week reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by a third, whilst consuming high fat dairy products can also lower your risk levels. A University of Eastern Finland led study has demonstrated that men who ate four eggs a week had a 37 per cent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who ate just one.Neilson BarnardGetty Images for The New York Culinary Experience34104 One in 20 UK parents thinks a packet of crisps countsAccording to a profoundly disheartening survey by Fruit Heroes, one in 20 parents consider crisps one of the day\u0027s much-vaunted five healthy things, and one in 10 don\u0027t believe eating fruit is good for you35104 Three year waits for childrenChildren with mental health problems can wait for more than three years to be assessed and up to nearly two years to receive treatment, according to a report. The number of children being sent to mental health service rose by more than 6 per cent between 2013 and 201436104 \u0027Homeopathy is no more effective than placebo\u0027Homeopathic remedies are “no more effective than placebo” in treating health problems, new research shows. The alternative medicine does not cure any conditions that are chronic, serious or could become serious – according to an assessment by the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia.37104 Sugar tax could save millionsA tax on sugary drinks could dramatically cuts cases of diabetes, heart disease and bowel cancer, and save the NHS millions every year, children’s health campaigners have claimed. As well as bringing in revenue for the Treasury, a tax of 20 pence on every litre of sugary drink sold in England could also save the NHS £15m a year, research by the Children’s Food Campaign (CFC) said.38104 Dementia risk can be reduced by improving lifestyleDoctors have the first conclusive proof that changes to lifestyle among the over-60s can slow mental decline – raising the prospects of dementia prevention programmes that cut your risk of the disease. The results are significant, as it is believed to be the first randomised and controlled trial to conclusively demonstrate that keeping the body healthy in later life also benefits the brain39104 Flu is much less common than you might thinkAdults over the age of 30 typically get flu about twice every 10 years whereas children contract the infection once every two years on average, a study has revealed40104 You\u0027re just like your fatherGenes from your father are more dominant than those inherited from your mother, new research has shown. All mammals are likely to use the majority of genetic material passed down from males, even if offspring look and act more like the mother, according to the study on lab mice by University of North Carolina’s School of Medicine41104 Scientists hail discovery of HIV pillA daily pill that can dramatically cut a person’s risk of contracting HIV must be made available through the NHS “as soon as possible”, campaigners have said. Results of a major UK trial of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have been described as “extremely exciting” and a “game-changer” by leading specialists.42104 Long sleep linked to strokesPeople who sleep for more than eight hours a day are more likely to have a stroke, research has shown – but experts do not know the reason why. A study of nearly 10,000 people carried out at the University of Cambridge found that those who took eight hours on average had a 46 per cent higher than average risk of having a stroke43104 Lung cancer breathalyser to go on trial in NHS hospitals by summer 2015 A new device that could detect lung cancer from a patient\u0027s breath is about to undergo clinical trials in NHS hospitals.

More than 300 new cases of the bacterial infection were reported in England last week, with 1,265 cases registered since the beginning of the year.47104 Fears that e-cigarettes are gateway drug as vaping outstrips puffingTwice as many young teenagers are using e-cigarettes than conventional cigarettes – and a significant proportion of them are getting their first taste of nicotine from “vaping” rather than smoking, a study has found. The findings have raised concerns among some experts that e-cigarettes, widely viewed as harmless to health, could be introducing children to the risk of nicotine addiction at an early age and so act as a “gateway” to smoking48104 HRT can increase a woman\u0027s chances of developing ovarian cancerWomen going through the menopause who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are putting themselves at a greater risk of ovarian cancer, Oxford University researchers have said. Their findings, based on a major review of virtually all existing evidence, suggest the dangers are slightly greater than previously thought, but experts said there was no reason for women to stop taking HRT49104 Tests begin on \u0027traffic light pacemaker\u0027 that could revolutionise heart treatment Scientists are to begin work on a revolutionary “traffic light pacemaker” that controls the beating of damaged hearts using blue and yellow fibre optic lights inside the body. Heart attacks and other major cardiac problems can damage the heart muscle, leaving patients vulnerable to dangerous disruptions in the heart’s rhythm – known as arrhythmia – often leading to heart failure. Researchers are exploring whether stem cell-generated heart cells could be implanted to regenerate the damaged areas. But progress has been held back because tests in the laboratory and in a small number of patients have shown that new tissue often fails to beat in time with the remaining healthy heart muscle50104 Smokers have thinner brain cortex and could have impaired thinkingA key part of the brain that is needed for thinking skills is smaller in smokers, new research has found. The findings show that smoking has an impact on brain functioning — as well as the heart and lungs. The outer brain layer or brain cortex is thinner in smokers, researchers have found. And while some of the thickness might come back after they quit, that might not happen51104 Drinking red wine could help overweight people burn fat Drinking red wine could help overweight people burn fat better and improve liver function, scientists in the US have claimed. Authors of a new study cautioned that the effects found would not stretch to weight loss and that the same compounds could be consumed by eating certain red grapes or drinking their juice52104 Common cold \u0027could be stopped in its tracks\u0027 thanks to science breakthrough The common cold could be a thing of the past, as scientists have found a way to jam the genetic code. The breakthrough means in the future, it could be possible to stop virus molecules replicating, by stopping them conveying the instructions needed to copy themselves.Green tea may help kick-start cycles of cancerous cell death while leaving healthy ones alone, scientists have claimed. A compound found in the tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate – or EGCG – could trigger a process of destroying malignant cells, researchers at Penn State’s Center for Plant and Mushroom Foods for Health have found54104 Double chins could be \u0027cured\u0027 without surgery or dieting using new injectionA treatment that promises to reduce double chins through a so-called fatburner injection could soon be on offer to the public. By injecting a specially formulated chemical known as ATX-101 into the skin, fat cells beneath the skin known as submental fat are removed.55104 Cannabis eases chronic pain better than commonly prescribed opioidsResearchers from the Australian National Drug and Alcohol centre found that patients with chronic pain who used the drug said it eased their symptoms better opioid medications, which are highly addictive and can cause accidental overdosesAlmost 500 newly identified cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) were reported by hospitals across England in one month, according to the latest figures. Despite the apparently high number of FGM cases, no one has yet been convicted for the practice, which has been illegal in the UK since 1985Campaigners are taking selfies of lipstick smudged across their faces after their smear tests to raise awareness over the importance of early cervical cancer detection58104 Plain packets to be soldThe Government has finally decided that cigarettes are to be sold in standardised packages in England. Jane Ellison, the public health minister, told the Commons that regulations would be put to a free vote before Parliament breaks up for the general election in May. The regulations could come into force next year.One of the most common sexual positions has also been dubbed the most dangerous by scientists. The woman-on-top position during intercourse was deemed responsible for half of all penile fractures sustained during sex in cases recorded at three hospitals, according to researchers in Brazil60104 Women may experience more pain during childbirth if their partner is presentFor many, the role of the expectant father is to provide comfort, reassurance and assistance to their partner at childbirth. A new study however has suggested they may be better off considering to stay well away from the delivery room as their presence could make the process of giving birth more painful.61104 Lie-in could lead obesity and diabetesPeople who find it difficult to get out of bed at the weekends are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems such as obesity and diabetes compared to iniduals who are up with the lark even when they do not have to go to work, a study has found62104 Dentists breach NHS rules with unclear pricing and guidanceSome NHS dentists are breaching rules by failing to offer clear pricing information and automatically offering private treatment – potentially resulting in patients being overcharged, an investigation has revealed63104 A drink a night \u0027is better for your heartIn what may prove to be badly timed news for those struggling to observe “dry January”, scientists have discovered that having up to seven drinks a week may give you a better chance of avoiding heart failure than people who abstain from alcohol completely. A study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that in middle-aged men, drinking up to seven small glasses of wine or about three and a half pints of beer a week was associated with a 20 per cent lower risk of developing heart failure when compared with teetotallersA record 2.5 million people are now living with cancer or the after-effects of it, threatening “a crisis of unmanageable proportions” for the NHS, a leading charity has warned.Waiting times in NHS accident and emergency (A\u0026ampE) departments across England are at their worst in a decade.

We warned them for years that there was an abnormal phenomenon that needed to be investigated… And the SPF never responded.”Ms Amar said she had attended last week’s committee meeting with one of the mothers of the children with the rare defect. “The main reaction is disappointment. These women are angry,” she said.The ministry of health expects its committee of experts to report their findings by 30 June.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The party might conceivably gain enough votes to enter the next Knesset, and potentially even become part of the governing coalition,” it added.AIPAC responded saying: “We agree with AJC. AIPAC has a long-standing policy not to meet with members of this racist and reprehensible party.”On Monday around 90 powerful rabbis and scholars part of Torat Chayim, a worldwide association of progressive-minded Orthodox rabbis, joined the denunciation of the Israeli leader’s new deal calling Jewish Power “lamentable”.Torat Chayim said Jewish Power was “a racist, violently nationalist party which justifies terrorist activity by Jews, is anti-democratic, preaches hatred toward other Jews and Arabs”.Among the signatories were renowned scholars Rabbi Yitz Greenberg and Rabbi Asher Lopatin.\u0026nbspThe ends do not justify the means, they wrote in as statement published online.Centrism is returning to Israeli politics, but concerns are still highMalcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations, also released a statement saying the alliance is very disturbing to many American Jews. He added that he feared the move would fuel Israel’s critics.Jewish Power last ran in the 2015 election on a joint list but has yet to secure a seat in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. The party calls for the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza, complete Israeli control over all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, the cancellation of the Oslo peace accords and for the imposition of Israeli sovereignty over Temple Mount.It also advocates the expulsion of Arab citizens of Israel who are deemed not loyal enough to the country and the deportation of what it calls “Arab extremists”.It is believed to be spawned from the Kahanist movement, founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was personally accused of plotting various terrorist attacks throughout the 1970s. Rabbi Kahane’s followers continue to face accusations of supporting domestic terrorism and incitement to racism.Mr Netanyahu is facing mounting pressure to perform well in the snap elections\u0026nbspset for 9 April.He did not directly respond to criticism from American Jewish leaders over the merger, but lashed out at comments made by Gantz and Lapid’s newly formed Blue and White Party.He accused the “Left” of allying with “extremist Islamists”.What hypocrisy and double standards by the left, the Israeli premier wrote on his Facebook page on Saturday.They denounce a bloc on the right with right-wing parties while the left has acted to put extremist Islamists into the Knesset to create a bloc that would overtake the right.Mr Netanyahu hopes to be re-elected for a fifth term, which would make him Israel longest-serving PM, but is campaigning under the shadow of possible indictment on corruption charges.Israeli media reported on Monday that the country’s Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit is expected to announce his decision on indicting Mr Netanyahu in two of the three graft cases against him.Left-leaning daily Haaretz reported that Mr Mendelblit is likely to indict the embattled leader in Case 1000, in which he allegedly accepted extravagant gifts, and Case 4000, or “Bezeq”, named after a telecommunications company he supposedly awarded regulatory favours too.Mr Mendelblit has apparently not yet made a decision on Case 2000, in which the premier allegedly struck a deal to get positive coverage in Israel’s second largest newspaper.Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly denied all the charges.Analysts told The Independent, against this backdrop, that the alliance with Jewish Power was proof the PM would do “anything to stay in\u0026nbsppower”.“The people who make up Jewish Power are right-wing fanatic religious trouble makers,\u0026nbspthey represent something very dangerous and have not had widespread support up until now,” said Dalia Scheindlin a public opinion expert who has worked on five Israeli electoral campaigns.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“I hear a number of voices in the national religious community freaking out,” she added.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Everything would be settled.

To proceed without informed consent would be a catastrophic mistake.”A further six Labour MPs came out in support of a second referendum for the first time in January, saying  it was the “the only logical option”the party could not secure a general election.Debbie Abrahams and Lilian Greenwood, both previously Labour frontbenchers, backed the campaign along with John Grogan, Graham Jones, Stephen Morgan and Matt Western.Under the terms of a motion passed at party conference last year, Labour is supposed to campaign for a People’s Voteit fails to bring about a General Election.But MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn and his close advisers are desperate to avoid one.His reluctance to commit to another referendum so close to Brexit day is costing him with many MPs and party members.In the latest twist, he was plunged into a fresh war over a second referendum after claims his aides deleted the mention of one in a “demands” letter to the PM.Sources yesterday said that in a draft letter compiled by Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, Labour said it would back a People’s VoteTheresa May didn’t meet their demands.A final letter sent by Mr Corbyn at the end of last week didn’t contain the threat.Corbyn said in a letter to the Prime Minister would back her Brexit planshe agreed to these conditions.Remain backing Labour MP Ben Bradshaw: “If this is true, any attempt by the leadership, or figures in the leaders’ office, to subvert or renege on Labour’s unanimously agreed policy would provoke uproar among our members, voters and MPs.According to polling, Labour members are signicantly more opposed to Brexit than Corbyn, with  per cent thinking their leader should support a second vote.A new poll shows the partys failure to back a second vote could be far more damaging than the Iraq war."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000295225347.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"car wash slaves","story":"If youve paid less than £, chances are they are a slave.Victims are threatened with violence against their families, have their passports stolen so they cant leave, and are crammed into rat-infested housing.Forced to work with toxic chemicals and no protective clothing, medics report cases where car wash slaves have found their shoes fused to their skin for weeks.Nor are these isolated incidents - there are , unregulated car wash sites, and  per cent of slave labour cases in  involved car wash workers.As part of the Suns Stamp Out Slavery campaign in conjunction with the Co Op, which proposes to extend support given to rescued slaves from  days to one year, we investigate the horrying truth behind cheap car washes.Joe, in his early twenties, travelled by coach from Poland to the UK after being promised building work in  - but when he arrived he was forced to work -hour days for free in a car wash and his gang master stole his passport so he couldnt leave.He and the other men working there were forbidden from taking lunch breaks or eating during their shts - and working in the cold and wet for so many hours left them sick.They were threatened with violence and given no rest - the men were forced to living in tiny room in a flat, with no heating or beds to sleep in - and they were fed scraps by their captors, who patrolled their digs at night.He says: “Whenever I complained about how badly I was being treated I was threatened with homelessness and violence towards me and my family.They claimed that they knew my family’s home address back in Poland and that they would go and hurt themI didnt do what I was told. They also showed me a box of weapons that they said they would use on anyone who went against them.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days government support after being recognised as a victim. Campaigners and businesses say this is not enough time for victims to find a place to live and means to support themselves so they risk becoming homeless and destitute.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a year to recover, and alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial support and other services.Fearing for his le, Joe eventually fled with nothing but the clothes he was wearing, and was referred to The Salvation Army who helped him find a safe house, where he is currently living. But sadly, like many victims of modern day slavery, Joe was so scared of his traffickers that he didn’t want to speak to the police so there was no investigation into his case.When labourer Sandu Laurentiu-Sava first arrived in the UK and landed a job in a car wash, he believed it was the perfect opportunity hed been looking for to earn enough money to provide for his family back home in Romania.However, the horric reality that greeted him was very dferent.When he arrived in the UK, he was forced to work long days at Bubbles Car Wash in Bethnal Green, East London, and kept in a squalid, rat-infested flat owned by his employer that he shared with five other workers.One summer evening in August  after a long sht Sandu, , was electrocuted and killed while taking a shower.Car wash owner Shaip Nimani, then , was jailed for four years after admitting manslaughter.Workers without rubber gloves have suffered burns from putting their bare hands into water tainted with chemicals, and a lack of protective footwear has also led to trench foot - a painful condition of the feet caused by long immersion in cold water.   Salvation Army medic Anne Read attended a police raid to provide support to potential victims last year and was horried by what she saw.She says: “We were offering them food and drink and the chance for a shower and a change of clothes while victims were being interviewed.“Whilst other men gratefully took the new clothes offered, one of them seemed reluctant to remove his shoes. When we askedhe was OK, he showed us his feet. He had been wearing just his own lightweight shoes to work on the car wash. Over time the harsh chemicals in the cleaning fluids he had been forced to use had fused his shoes onto his feet, which meant that he hadn’t been able to remove them for weeks.The shoes had to be surgically removed. This is just one of many stories of the unspeakable cruelty people face at the hands of their trafficker which we see everyday as victims of modern slavery come to us for support.Despite being promised work and accommodation by gang members posing as recruiters, sadly for the large number of car wash labourers trafficked to the UK, the pay and living conditions are diabolical.Hand car washing has grown largely unchecked for the past  to  years, car wash expert Dawn Frazer says.In November last year police raided a premises in Manchester and three men were detained. Police said  ‘potential victims’ of slavery were rescued following the sting on Drive and Shine car wash.In  Kristian Holub admitted forcing Czech immigrant Milan Tencik - who was made to sleep on the floor - to work in a car wash, and business owner Ali Mohammed Raza was jailed for six years in  for trafficking five Syrian illegal immigrants to Hull to clean vehicles. In the same year brothers Igor and Marek Marcin got  months and  months’ jail time for trafficking  Czech and Slovak men to work in car washes and factories, paying them just £ a week and putting them up in bug-infested rooms.Heartbreaking stories like these are why The Sun is backing calls for a change in the law so that specialist support given to modern slavery victims – including forced labour and human trafficking – is increased from as little as  days to a full year, as they rebuild their lives.You can sign the petition for the Modern Slavery Victim Support Bill here.Find out more about Co-Ops Bright Future programme, which offers employment to survivors of modern slavery, here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470023516.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"anila baig nothing shamima believes is to do with being muslim","story":"She made her bed and now, however uncomfortable it is, she must lie in it.But you must know one thing. None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds.

You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity.

They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but not a commercial one.The report states: [The plane] was registered in the USA and could not be used for commercial operations without permission from the FAA and CAA.At the time of writing there was no evidence that such permission had been sought or granted.To fly an aircraft registered in the USA between EASA Member States, a pilot must operate using the privileges of an FAA licence..pm - Emiliano Sala arrives at the airport..pm - The flight taxies out for departure..pm - The Piper Malibu plane takes off from Nantes Airport and climbs to around ,ft..pm - The pilot requests permission to descend to maintain visibility and alters cours from planned flight path..pm - The pilot makes its final radio contact with Jersey Radar and requests second permssion to descend..pm - The plane appears to climb rapidly from around ,ft to ,ft while turning away from its flight path..pm - The plane makes its final radar contact.Investigators also revealed the plane plunged at a rate of around ,ft-a-minute after twice requesting permission to descend in order to gain better visibility in heavy fog.In its final seconds, the report says radar signals suggest the plane climbed rapidly from around ,ft to about ,ft.The plane lost contact with air traffic control just seconds later.Mr Ibbotsons private licence meant he could only fly passengers in the European Union on a cost sharing basis, and not for any commercial profit.The cost sharing arrangement allows for iniduals to split the expenses of a private flight, but Mr Ibbotson would have had to have paid at least half of the costs.The Sun previously revealed the pilot was battling £, of debts at the time of the crash.David Ibbotson decided not to use flight instruments that were vital to flying through cloudy conditions on the night of the doomed flight to Cardf, it has been claimed.He also filled the Malibu-Piper aircraft’s licence number incorrectly on his flight plan form.The damning claims have been made by Argentinian journalist Christian Martin.Martin, who works for Fox News, claimed Mr Ibbotson used Visual Flight Rulesinstead of Instrument Flight Ruleson the night of January .This means he accepted the disregard of flying with instruments, key to flying between clouds without the visibility of a horizontal line.That night there were many clouds and a cold snap over the English Channel.”Martin described the mistakes as basic errors.In order for pilots to fly VFR, they cannot fly through clouds and in types of airspace they have to be able to see the ground.Under VFR pilots are responsible for seeing other aircraft and avoiding collisions and it requires a minimum standard of weather conditions to be present.When the operation of an aircraft under VFR is not safe, IFR must be used instead. It is claimed that Ibbotson didnt do this.The report states Mr Ibbotson arrived in Nantes two days before the flight on January .Mr Ibbotson, , had written he was a bit rusty with the ILSon Facebook after arriving at the airport.He later wrote: Was not tobad when I got there but Im a bit rusty with the ils, in France now.A friend replied: Rusty with the ILS ! I cant believe that!Mr Ibbotson added: You wanna bet, a little on the high side hehe, better than on the low side.Sala arrived at the airport at .pm on the night of January  and the flight took off exactly half an hour later.The plane made last contact with air traffic control over the Channel Islands at .pm.The wreckage of the plane was found on the sea bed - along with Salas body - just  metres from where the last contact was made.Argentinian footballer Sala had just signed for Cardf City from French club Nantes for £ million when the plane crashed into the Channel on January .His body was recovered on February  but pilot David Ibbotson, , of Crowle, Lincolnshire, has not been located.Mr Ibbotsons family hope a fresh search for his body will begin this week after setting up an online fundraising campaign which has reached £,.The aircraft remains underwater off the coast of Guernsey after an attempt to recover it was hampered by bad weather.We pay for your stories!

We cannot and will not accept.One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent No Deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal.“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Fears had been growing thatMr Corbyn didnt go against his principles and back a second referendum more Labour MPs would leave and join the new Independent Group.And the dramatic announcement may also temporarily move the focus away from the anti-semitism crisis currently surrounding the Labour party.But the announcement sparked a fresh bout of furious infighting last night and MPs representing pro-Leave constituencies vowed they would do all they can to stop a “corrosive” second vote.Former shadow cabinet minister Lucy Powell said around  Labour MPs will vote against a second referendum.And Labour’s former Europe minister Caroline Flint said there will “never be unity in the party”it thwarts Brexit.While pro-Brexit MP John Mann  warned Corbyn in last night’s meeting: “In the Midlands and north of England this decision today will stop you from being Prime Minister. The price will be paid”.Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell told The Sun: “I won’t be voting for a second referendum under any circumstances.”Asked how many Labour MPs would vote against a second referendum, he said: “Enough to make sure it doesn’t happen.Labour MP for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock said he held “deep reservations” about a second vote and warned it would have a “corrosive” impact on democracy in the UK.Senior Labour backbencher Sir Kevin Barron also criticised Mr Corbyns decision to back a second referendum.He said: “The Labour manesto in  clearly stated that we accepted the referendum result, therefore I cannot understand why we are now being asked to back another.I will be sticking to my promise to my constituents and voting against any attempt to force a second referendum.”Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry confirmed on Monday night that the party would campaign to remain.She told Channel  News: If its a choice between that and a disastrous Tory Brext, we will be campaigning to remain, because thats all we can do.Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan backed Corbyns U-turn, saying: It is the right decision for London - and for the whole country - to give the public their say for the first time on a final Brexit deal.Meanwhile Tory critics slammed Mr Corbyn and accused him selling out Leave-supporting Labour voters.Tory MP Simon Clarke said: Labour have been shaping up to try to overturn the decision of millions of northern voters for some time. Those voters will, rightly, feel bitterly betrayed.Colleague Bob Seely tweeted: Shameless #Corbyn who wanted Brexit now backs a second referendum to save his sorry leadership.Tory party chairman, Brandon Lewis, added: With only  days to go until we leave the European Union, it is clear that Jeremy Corbyns Labour want to betray the will of the British people and ignore the biggest democratic vote in our nation’s history.“Corbyn’s Labour have ripped up their promise to respect the referendum result and are now pursuing a isive second referendum that would take us back to square one.Once again it’s clear: Jeremy Corbyn is using Brexit to play his own political games.“Instead of working to thwart Brexit at this critical stage, Jeremy Corbyn should put the country’s interest before his party’s - by backing a deal that respects and delivers on the result of the referendum.”But the party’s Remainers were jubilant with the decision.Speaking last night Peter Kyle said: “I think it’s been part of our conference policy for a good six to eight months now, so I’m not surprised Labour has got to this point and the clock is ticking.”“The truth is I have spoken to as many people from Conservative side as I have Labour. I have spoken to people in the Cabinet down to backbenches.“Last week I had a Government minister call to meet up and discuss this deal.”Fellow Remainer Stephen Doughty said: “It’s a very welcome step forwards.”Lord Mandelson was delighted with the decision – saying a second referendum was now “inevitable”.Tottenham MP and People’s Vote campaigner David Lammy said: “It is welcome news that the Labour Party is now, at long last, signalling it will accept the principle of giving the public the final say on Brexit.”EvenMPs can agree some sort of deal, it would be wrong to force it on the British people when we now know so many of the promises made in  have been broken and any deal will be worse than the one we’ve already got inside the EU.But other Remainers poured scorn on Mr Corbyn’s commitment - saying he was “just kicking the can down the road”.Brexiteers also tore into Mr Corbyn’s annoucement last night, with the boss of the Leave Means Leave campaign John Longworth branding it a “cowardly decision from a man who should never be trusted with the Premiership of this country”.He added: “Leave Means Leave strongly believes no deal is no problem, however,Corbyn and his comrades get their way it won’t just be no deal for the UK but no future either. This Brexit betrayal must be stopped.”Jacob Rees Mogg told The Sun: “In an outburst of Socialist logic the Labour Party now backs a losers vote after those who most strongly campaigned for it have left to set up their new group.”Meanwhile, Labour will also endorse an amendment by Yvette Cooper due to be voted on this Wednesday which would rule out No Deal by giving the Commons the right to delay Brexit instead.But a so-called peoples vote is still some way away - with several more steps needed before it could actually happen.And Westminster insiders suspect Mr Corbyns move is more to do with keeping his MPs happy than trying to overturn Brexit - given his lelong suspicion of the EU.On Wednesday, the Commons will vote on the way forward for Brexit.One of the amendments debated will express support for Labours alternative Brexit deal which would keep Britain in the EU customs union.Onlythat motion fails - as seems almost certain - will Mr Corbyn formally back a second referendum.Theresa May has vowed to bring her deal back to Parliament by March , andit passes then Britain WILL quit the EU.Butit fails, MPs will get a chance to vote on the next steps - and that would be the moment for Labour to support a referendum.EvenLabour, the SNP, Lib Dems and Independents win enough Tory support to get a peoples vote, its not clear what form the referendum would take.No one knows whether it would have two or three choices on the ballot paper - with the PMs deal, No Deal and Remain all potential outcomes.And to give Britain enough time for a second referendum, the EU would have to allow a delay of several months to the ongoing Brexit process.Mr Corbyn has previously resisted all moves to reverse Brexit despite pleas from pro-EU Labour activists.Todays move comes after nine of his MPs quit last week, with eight forming the anti-Brexit Independent Group.It could end up backfiring by panicking Tory Brexiteers into voting for Mrs Mays deal because theyre worried its the only way to deliver Brexit at all.The ex-Labour and Tory MPs smiled in the picture tweeted by Chuka Umunna, second right. It came amid rumours the first Lib Dem is to join.Gavin Shuker, far left, ex- Labour MP for Luton South, was elected as “convener” at yesterday’s meeting.

The couple had been en route to London for a night out when the incident happened - and now say Lamborghini Birmingham arent interested after they claim they were nearly killed straight after the car underwent a pound, service. Mr Sira said he is considering taking legal action against the dealership. I was on the way to London with my girlfriend for a night out as I just had the car back and wanted to drive it around, he said.   We had only gone one junction when my girlfriend smelt petrol in the car, so I called the garages mechanic. He said the car has just been for a service and it is usual to smell a bit of fuel, so there wasnt a problem. So we carried on a bit further and my girlfriend asked me to open the windows, because the smell of fuel had got that strong. I stopped on the hard shoulder, between J and J, to remove the roof but then the next thing was we heard a loud bang, it was like a firework going off, and the back of my car caught fire.  I just had to watch helplessly as the car which I had worked so hard to buy went up in smoke. We nearly died,I didnt pull over when I did I dread to think what happened. It was very frightening and my girlfriend is scared to get in any car with me now. Lak, who earns pound, a year running an online trading company, is pointing the finger at the garage, accusing them of negligence.  I am meeting with my solicitor to see whether to take legal action as I cant believe its a coincidence that Id only just had the car back from the garage. The -year-old business man said that he worked his way up from a Sainsburys and a Yodel warehouse, and has worked from the bottomto own the Lamborghini, which he described as his dream car I worked   for four years in order to buy this car, he said. It was my pride and joy and I never imagined I would ever get to sit in one, let alone own my dream car.  Im absolutely devastated. I only had the car for a year and a half and I loved it.. I paid pound, to get it gold plated and pound, on the service - and then this happens. I want answers because it clearly wasnt safe to drive andit had burst into flames as I was going along then we could have been killed.

The Cabinet minister also said the UK would not provide any help to Ms Begums baby boy while he is in Syria because it has no consular presence there.

Despite Labours support it doesn’t mean that a second vote will happen. The numbers in Parliament are still not there.Around two dozen Labour MPs are thought to be against the plan, worrying that it would be too isive for the country. And only a handful of Tories back a People’s Vote, so even with the support of the SNP and the Lib Dems, it remains very unlikely to pass.That does not mean Corbyn’s move was futile. Is Labour united behind the move  As MPs in the crowded Westminster room last night testied, the parliamentary party was more united than it has been for months.  All the expectations were that the Labour leader would face a barracking over his handling of anti-semitism and flack for centrist MPs quitting the party. But by pulling the second referendum rabbit out of the hat, he looks likely to have staved off more defections for now. He has also given his increasingly mutinous core supporters - many of them young and enthusiastic Remainers - renewed faith. What do Labour MPs in Leave seats say  While some Labour MPs in Leave seats argue that backing a second referendum will be electoral suicide, that is unlikely to ever be properly tested. There is always the danger that the move could unite the Conservative party and help get the PM’s deal over the line.But there are some who believe that the Labour leader wouldn’t be too unhappy to see Brexit happen.Will a second referendum actually happen  Corbyn’s team know that while the move is a gamble, he is likely to end up on the right side of Labour Party history. It is probably too late for his backing for a People’s Vote to actually help deliver one. But the leadership will always be able to claim that, in the end, he came round. A second referendum was always supposed to be the final option on the table. With party heavyweights including Keir Starmer, Tom Watson and Emily Thornberry behind it - it also became one he could not longer resist,"},{"url":null,"title":"birmingham pub bombing families demand","story":"NewsBirmingham pub bombing: Families demand the truth  years after blast killed A minutes silence has been held as an inquest opens into explosions at two busy pubs which ripped apart familiesShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  FEB NewsJulie Hambleton , whose sister Maxine died, walks with Michelle Sealey , whose father Paul Davies was also among those killed\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThose who lost loved ones in Birmingham’s  pub bombings say they hope “the truth” will finally emerge as the inquests into the  who died resumed.

Benjamin Jay Smith, , regularly scoffed greasy takeaways, including two double cheeseburgers or  chicken nuggets, for dinner. He ballooned to a whopping  stone and was unable to walk upstairs or even put on his own socks six months ago.But since then, the entrepreneur has fought the flab and lost the astounding  stone. He has also invested poundmillion of his own cash into creating an app to help others lose weight, Wales Online says.Benjamin, from Wrexham, north Wales, said: I was so fat that I couldn’t put my socks on or go upstairs. It was embarrassing. I felt like a pudding.   I’ve always been an emotional binge eater. I was addicted to food – high-calorie pizzas were my downfall – and was regularly eating triple the recommended daily allowance. I hated looking at myself in a mirror, was embarrassed about my size, and felt depressed. Benjamin finally decided to shed the pounds when his now we Cara was ill with lipoedema and needed an urgent operation. The long-term condition leads to painful swelling in the legs, thighs, and buttocks. I had to be strong for her. So I changed my focus to only eating food when my body needed it and I cut right back on my high-calorie diet, he said.  I started to exercise and taught myself about nutrition. The super slimmer decided to create the Fine Diet Plan, a fat-busting plan which counts weekly calories. Over three weeks the app calculates information about the user in order to work out their inidualised calorie requirements as accurately as possible. This information allows the team to calculate the user’s basal metabolic rate and, when combined with their occupation and activity levels, works out their optimum calorie intake for weight loss. Videos posted online show Ben’s transformation from being a st man with a -inch waist to becoming a trim st six months later with a -inch waist.   There is also a video showing him wearing the same T-shirt in his fat and slimmed-down days. I realised that it’s so old hat to count daily calories, which is why I used my experience to create the Fine Diet Plan, Benjamin said. On it, it’s fine to eat whatever you want – all the foods you love – and still lose weight. It’s all about nailing your maintenance calories – and everyone is dferent. I’m hoping that what I’ve learnt will help others to lose weight and could even tackle the obesity epidemic.

But realising he couldn’t swim, Swinfield then begged a police officer to pull him from the water. The officer in question was holding Swinfields baby at the time, having removed the child from the upturned vehicle.   Jailing him for  months, Recorder Simon King said: “This was as dangerous as it is possible to get without it resulting in death or serious injury not only to your partner and son but to other road users. “The horrible irony is that the two people who suffered the most serious injuries, although thankfully they were not too serious, were your partner and young son who you left abandoned in the car which you flipped. “The maximum sentence I can give you is two years and I am obliged to give you % credit for your guilty plea.   “Be assured thatthere was a more serious punishment available to me I would have no hesitation to handing it to you.” Sarah Slater, prosecuting, played CCTV footage of part of the chase to the court. It showed officers begin to follow Swinfield, in Nottingham Road, before he accelerates into Cleveland Avenue, reaching more than mph in a mph street.  Swinfield then speeds down Lansdown Grove, Florence Avenue, Norfolk Road, back on the Nottingham Road, Market Place and finally on to Tamworth Road where he collides with the final vehicle and ends up on the roof. Miss Slater said: “In a statement, his partner said she was asking him to stop and he was telling her it would be okay. “She said she remembers being in the car with it on the roof and with their child in a seat in the back. “She said he said to her ‘I have got to go’ and left her and the baby in the car which, by now, was smoking.” Miss Slater said the woman and baby were freed from the car and, as one of the officers was holding the baby, Swinfield was calling for help to get him out of the canal as he could not swim. He was arrested, charged and pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, failing to stop following an accident and to driving without insurance or a valid licence. The incident happened at .pm on Saturday, January , involved a Vauxhall Corsa and closed part of Tamworth Road, in Long Eaton. The partner and child were taken to the Queens Medical Centre following the crash which saw them both receive black eyes and bruising. Christopher Brewin, for Swinfield, said: “He does appreciate how serious this is and he’s ashamed of his conduct.” As well as the jail term, Recorder King handed Swinfield a two-year driving ban.

And a -year-old says taking up the role is easier than one might think. There are several companies which operate around the country, such as Seeking Arrangements, which enable users to meet a Sugar Daddy or Momma.According to the SA website, millions of students are taking on these roles as an innovative way to pay off their student loans. Nearly  students from the University of Cambridge are signed up to SA making it the th most popular destination for sugar baby activities in the country.The site has around  new signings each year from Cambridge University.Cambridgeshire Live spoke to a local sugar baby , , to find out what exactly goes on behind closed doors. What made you do it and is it for everyone I heard about the site through friends but it wasn’t until I read an article online about how this girl quit and actually married her Sugar Daddy that I decided to try it. You just have to be someone who is comfortable being upfront about what you are looking for in your next relationship. I was a student when I began using the site. I chose to date a higher class of man to help me supplement my living costs, yes.How much money do you make The men that I meet are not customers. I don’t think that’s allowed. We actually date! If I do receive financial or physical gts, the amount ies. I’d saythey are helping me with my bills, I’m gted about pound, per month. In total I’ve probably been gted about pound, since finding my most recent Sugar Daddy.Aside from the money are there any other perks of the job In terms of seeking, the best part is having access to people all over the world and I have met a few really cool people. I’m a major foodie so I love to go out to lunch or dinner. I have travelled a little bit throughout the country and to a few other big cities. Sometimes we go to concert events or Broadway shows.  You read all sorts about sugar babies getting designer handbags and Chanel No. - but whats the most expensive gt youve ever received The most expensive place that I’ve been was to Paris for four days last year. The most expensive gts that I’ve received have been a Rolex and a few designer shoes, a few Jimmy Choos, Louboutins and Louis Vuitton bags.Yeah sure, we all have Louboutins knocking around the house! But it cant be all designer gts and romantic getaways. Do you ever get scared something might happen to you The worst part is that there are some people on there with the wrong intentions or pretend to be someone they are not. It’s just like other dating sites that I’ve tried. I wasn’t so much scared because I know the cautionary steps of meeting someone for the first time, but I was certainly a little nervous to find out what he was looking for and how he’d approach this style of dating. As long as I am smart and cautious about who I meet, it’s no dferent than dating before. I do use a dferent name and number until I meet with the right match. I do this because it adds a sense of safety andthey somehow tried to expose my personal information online, it’d be harder to trace.Do you think of it as your real job The biggest misconception about sugar babies, is that people think we are lazy and don’t want to be more than a Sugar Baby. I have a job, I work part-time as a customer service representative and that’s my job. I have dreams, and goals that I want to achieve.Right, lets address the elephant in the room, do you have sex with your Sugar Daddies and do they have any weird fetishes I don’t have customers, just Sugar Daddies. If I feel like it’s grown to a point where I trust this person and see him in my le, why not. It’s no dferent than having a boyfriend of the same age, who is rich and can splurge on fancy dinners or gts. I have yet to meet one with a fetish but my friend has met a few with some interesting requests.Such as That would be telling...How often do you see each other I see my partners maybe two or three times a week. I prefer to date one person at a time. I also chat with my past Sugar Daddies all the time.

Intrigued by the bold design, one mum decided to try to recreate it as a special treat for her partner on Valentines Day. But Lauras homemade design doesnt look quite like the photo listed on ASOS, and she ended up exposing absolutely everything. Its so revealing that she was forced to cover her private parts with emojis before she shared the photo on her blog Knee Deep in Le. She wrote: GOOGLE GOALS....BE MY VALENTINE ...... When its the night of steaks and blowjobs and you want him to know after all these years youre still trying to keep the spark alive, but he just watched your vagina swallow  inches of his dressing gown cord and he’s just not that hungry anymore.   Wonky nipples! Theyre less like identical twins and more like estranged half sisters who just cant see eye to eye. S*** happens! Valentines is overrated anyway.... Its not the first time Laura has had people in stitches recreating looks.Last year she decided to recreate a photo she saw on Beginning Boutiques Instagram page, featuring a woman wearing a pair of very revealing high-waisted bikini bottoms and a cropped t-shirt.The Boutiques Instagram post was bombarded with comments from unimpressed shoppers, who branded the garment a vagina flosser. Laura, who is known for sharing silly snaps and videos online, attempted her best Blue Steel after her followers requested she buy the odd bikini and review it for them.  Instead of splashing the cash on the pricey item, she decided to make her own version - using a superhero belt and one of her childrens tops. She captioned it: GOOGLE GOALS... FANNY FLOSSING. When everyone begs you to buy it, review it and youre like F*** NO! Its pound and its January. I can make that s*** work with a superman belt and a kids t-shirt. Aint no one got any business seeing the other side of that emoji, she continued. Its like a hairy angry venus fly trap that smells a bit like piss and old farts. Just like the Body Bow, Laura had to used emojis to cover her privates.

Not that we really thought or spoke about it but I donrsquot think we were too far away from getting to the record of clean sheets and wersquod got there by playing some very good football.ldquoItrsquos disappointing. Something Irsquove never seen before. Itrsquos a bit embarrassing to be honest. Irsquom sure they woke up on Monday morning and were a bit embarrassed of how theyrsquove handled it.

As play slowed anticipating a casual passing of the ball back, it quickly became apparent that the teenager was going for goal.Scott looked sheepish as he left the pitch later in the game, almost apologising to his bench, and Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson cited the inexperience of the player as the reason for the goal that flouted convention.Bain, though, was scornful of the reasons offered as he insisted that the responsibility for it ought to have been taken by the Motherwell management.ldquoTheir manager tried to blame it on a young lads but yoursquod got the chance to recty the situation after and they donrsquot do it, said Bain.ldquoI dunno. So, what has [Scott] not watched football before  Hersquos not played a game before  Youth team levels all the way up, it happens at every level. I thinkyou are the manager you have to recty the situation.ldquoI donrsquot understand what he was thinking. Hersquos tried to blame it on a young lad but hersquos in charge.

They wanted to try and get a second goal and get a point or go on to win the game.It will be interesting to note just what happens in the next fixtures between the sidesthere is a similar scenario of a player on either side requiring treatment. Bainrsquos fury was still simmering as he suggested that he would be playing tit-for-tat in any future matches, but that would seem unlikely given Brendan Rodgersrsquo is always at pains to stress a respect for opponents.Still, though,it was up to Bain there would be no such understanding.ldquoIf it was up to me  No. Not a chance, he said. ldquoIn future wersquoll probably just play with  men and not put the ball out of play. So our players could be lying down seriously injured. But it happened and we go from there.ldquoMost of the boys were angry and they have the right to be. It is not something we would do and it is not something I have seen anyone do, really. They have the right to be angry and for five or ten minutes it disjointed us a little bit and they came into the game but after the game against Valencia and how much all the boys put into that game and to power through again and get another two goals and win comfortably says a lot about the character in the team.\""},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119767.jpg","title":"Climate action call comes to Inverness streets","story":"CLIMATE change activists from the Black Isle and Inverness have shown their solidarity for school pupils across the world after the youngsters held a lsquostrikersquo to flag up ecological concerns.New group Extinction Rebellion Highlands and Islands held a stall in Inverness High Streetlast Saturday, asking passers-by to sign a petition calling for urgent action by Highland Council to do its bit to tackle the threat, amid growing worries that the planetrsquos global warming is nearing an irreversible tipping point.Organised by Black Isle activist Anne Thomas, who is also involved with Transition Black Isle, the stall attracted  signatures in the space of  minutes.The youth strike, which included Highland participants, was sparked by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg who spoke at the last major UN Climate Change summit saying adults were not doing enough and time was running out.ldquoLots of people had been impressed by the stand the kids had taken and were keen to show their support, said Ms Thomas. ldquoThey agreed that government at all levels is not doing enough to stop dangerous levels of global warming and climate change.ldquoScientists say we have less than  years to prevent warming going over . degrees, so we need to take drastic measures now.

We originally only planned to install one but the money kept coming in and we had enough for another one so we spoke to Davy’s Fish Bar and they said they would back it.”The defibrillators can be purchased for around £, – a reduced price because they were bought in bulk through the Butchers at the Heart of the Community scheme.Both defibrillators will be accessibly to the public when needed.If an emergency  call is made and the defibrillator is registered with the Scottish Ambulance Service, the nearest device can be located and a code given to the caller to unlock it.Once opened, instructions are provided.For heart-attack victims, the community defibrillators could prolong their lives by vital minutes, because the more time that passes during a cardiac arrest without assistance, the less chance there is of survival.Mr Milne said he was overwhelmed by the community’s generosity.He said: “Most of it was raised in the shop.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14036524.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_130219hospice2.jpg","title":"ayrshire hospice marks 30th birthday","story":"NewsAyrshire Hospice marks th birthday as staff and volunteers reflect on three decades of serviceThe milestone birthday has been marked with a series of events and celebrations.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor  years it has touched the lives of thousands in Ayrshire and far beyond.

She alleged that on each occasion he whispered to her afterwards” If you tell anyone I will kill you and your mum.” Curdy, who is on trial at the High Court in Glasgow, denies raping her on ious occasions between April  and August , , at a house in the South of France. Mr Ewing told the jury that the Crown is relying on testimony from the girls mother, who is , to corroborate the rape. She alleges that Curdy also raped her in August  in the South of France. The mothers allegation, which he denies, is not before the jury. Under Scots Law alleged crimes against children committed in another country can be prosecuted here, but not those against adults.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

to new research.While there is a huge range of vitamins on the market for parents to choose from, the vast majority contain far less than the correct dose, experts said.Vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, a condition that affects bone development in children and which can lead tothe growth of soft, weak and deformed limbs.It is dficult to get enough vitamin D from diet, and the main source is sunshine.However, the weather in the UK means that there is limited exposure to sunlight from November to March.Public Health Englandrecommends that children aged one to four receive a daily  microgramvitamin D supplement.Those aged under one should be given a . to  microgram daily vitamin D supplement to ensure they get enough.In the new study, experts from the universities of Oxford and Southampton examined vitamins aimed at children sold by Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsburyrsquos, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett,Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug.In total,  multivitamin products made by  dferent manufacturers were included in the study.The daily vitamin D dose in the vitamins ranged from zero to IU.Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied IU per day ndash around half the recommended amount.For children under six months of age, only one multivitamin contained more than  IU day vitaminD, but this was only recommended from four months of age.For children over six months, just % to % of the available multivitamins provided the recommended IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.The researchers also looked at specic vitamin D products and vitamins marketed as being for healthy bones.Of the  products that were available, the range of vitamin D in them was from  to ,IU.Six products were suitable from birth, of which five contained  to IU per day ndash around the recommended amount.Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors concluded: ldquoThere is a wide range of both multivitamins and vitamin D supplementsavailable for children in the UK, yet most of these do notprovide the recommended  IU day.ldquoMultivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplementsor lsquohealthy bonesrsquo products, although some products labelled as lsquofor bonesrsquo contained very low levels of vitamin D.The team also looked at the Governmentrsquos Healthy Start scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide onlyIU per day of vitamin D.The research comes after data analysed by the Press Association showed there were , hospital admissions with a main or secondary diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in   ndash % more than the , in  .There were an additional  admissions in   where the main or secondary reason was rickets, up from the year before.Almost all these cases were young children, with  admissions for rickets in children aged nine and under, up from  the year before.A further  admissions for rickets were among those aged  to , up from  the year before.Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said:ldquoA normal healthy UK diet provides less than % of the recommended amount of vitamin D.ldquoThe natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure to sunlight in the UK so supplements are the only way to ensure UK children get the recommended dose.ldquoTo learn that so many products fail to provide children with the recommended level of Vitamin D is highly concerning, especially when latest evidence shows our childrenrsquos average intake are still below the recommended amount.ldquoThese products are misleading parents who think they are protecting their children from serious conditions such as rickets, poor growth and muscle weakness.ldquoI would advise all parents to check that the supplements they use contain the recommended  units of vitamin D and consult their pharmacistthey are unsure.He also said the Government should seriously consider fortying somefoods and milk with Vitamin D.Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the industry-funded health and food supplements information service , said: ldquoFood supplements are meant to supplement the diet, not replace the nutrients obtained from foods.ldquoIn that respect, and since there are ying recommendations across dferent age groups of children, it is right that dferent supplements offer dferent doses.ldquoSmaller doses allow parents to use the same product for younger and older children by ying the amount given.ldquoAccording to the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey data, children and adolescents are only getting a fth of the recommended vitamin D intake of  microgram from food alone.ldquoMany of the supplements in this survey would actually

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

Norman Mackenzie, etc.The chairman, at the outset, welcomed all to what he was sure they hoped and felt pretty confident would be the last annual meeting during the war, for technically the war was still with us, although they all hoped and prayed that within a very few weeks a conclusion would have come to it and they would have entered upon the complete enjoyment of a conclusive peace."},{"url":null,"title":"young bakers produce perfect pancakes","story":"The future generation of Salvation Army bakers produced perfect pancakes under expert guidance.Pancake professional Margaret Raeside helped Brooke Oxborrow, , and Tianna McMillan, , make enough of the flat round cakes to feed an army last Saturday.As well as honing their baking skills in the kitchen, the girls served tables of visitors in the hall.In addition to freshly flipped pancakes and perfectly packaged home-baking, trinkets and gts, created at the church#s Make and Munch craft group, were also for sale.The event raised £. for church funds.Brooke Oxborrow, Margaret Raeside and Tianna McMillan making perfect pancakes. _csalarmyMyrtle Reid, left, holds knitting she created, while Michelle Plant holds a frame made at the church#s craft group.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

is a huge range of vitamins on the market for parents to choose from, the vast majority contain far less than the correct dose, experts said.Vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, a condition that affects bone development in children and which can lead tothe growth of soft, weak and deformed limbs.It is dficult to get enough vitamin D from diet, and the main source is sunshine.However, the weather in the UK means that there is limited exposure to sunlight from November to March.Public Health Englandrecommends that children aged one to four receive a daily  microgramvitamin D supplement.Those aged under one should be given a . to  microgram daily vitamin D supplement to ensure they get enough.In the new study, experts from the universities of Oxford and Southampton examined vitamins aimed at children sold by Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsburyrsquos, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett,Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug.In total,  multivitamin products made by  dferent manufacturers were included in the study.The daily vitamin D dose in the vitamins ranged from zero to IU.Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied IU per day ndash around half the recommended amount.For children under six months of age, only one multivitamin contained more than  IU day vitaminD, but this was only recommended from four months of age.For children over six months, just % to % of the available multivitamins provided the recommended IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.The researchers also looked at specic vitamin D products and vitamins marketed as being for healthy bones.Of the  products that were available, the range of vitamin D in them was from  to ,IU.Six products were suitable from birth, of which five contained  to IU per day ndash around the recommended amount.Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors concluded: ldquoThere is a wide range of both multivitamins and vitamin D supplementsavailable for children in the UK, yet most of these do notprovide the recommended  IU day.ldquoMultivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplementsor lsquohealthy bonesrsquo products, although some products labelled as lsquofor bonesrsquo contained very low levels of vitamin D.The team also looked at the Governmentrsquos Healthy Start scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide onlyIU per day of vitamin D.The research comes after data analysed by the Press Association showed there were , hospital admissions with a main or secondary

before.Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said:ldquoA normal healthy UK diet provides less than % of the recommended amount of vitamin D.ldquoThe natural way

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history.

He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"students-sign-open-letter-to-call-for-review-into-universal-credit","story":"The group say UC has ldquofundamentally disregarded students in the way it calculates their income, with lone parents, the disabled and students from low income families among the hardest hit.Paloma Paige, president of the St Andrews University Studentsrsquo Association, is the main signatory of the letter and warns of the long-term impact on access to education.She said: ldquoThe effects on student claimants puts widening access and ersity initiatives at risk. It is simply unacceptable that some of our most vulnerable students are left behind by a policy which should be supporting them.UC is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, uniting six lsquolegacyrsquo benefits - including tax credits, housing benefit and unemployment benefit - into one paid monthly, but it has proved hugely controversial. Designed to simply the system, but has proved hugely controversial, with many saying they are worse off and at a greater risk of hunger, debt and rent arrears.According to the National Union of Students , those who claim UC are harder hit than those who work, as for every pound that someone earns through work, they see p deducted from their monthly payments.However, for students who claim UC, their loans and grants are regarded as unearned income and therefore untaxed, so for each pound they receive, they lose the same amount from their claim.In the letter, signed by students from universities including St Andrews, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Dundee, they state: ldquoMany students are now finding themselves in a position where it is becoming increasingly dficult to maintain their place at university or colleges up, while trying to keep roofs over their heads and feed and clothe their families. This is particularly true for lone parent students, students with low-income families and disabled students. This is down to Universal Credit and how it deducts student income.ldquoUniversal Credit is the benefit that we are constantly being told is designed to lsquomake work payrsquo, but claimants are finding this is not the case, especially students. Does putting in a full-time working week at university not count as work  Under legacy benefits such as tax credits student income is not taken in to account, allowing families to still receive child tax credit alongside their student loan which would go a long way to helping offset the costs of raising a family, but because Universal Credit classes student income as unearned income it is taken into account and deducted pound for pound, leaving many claimants with no award or very little.The letter adds that the system will ldquostop disadvantaged students taking up places at university that they have worked incredibly hard for and calls on the government to review how students are impacted, adding: ldquoIf this is allowed to continue then we are potentially denying our country of seeing some of our best and brightest from fulfilling their potential and this in turn will have a knock-on effect for universities, who will start to notice a decrease in their student intake.ldquoWhat does this say for the future of our world-renowned university system and research hubs that play such an important part in the world stage  This does not look like the meritocratic society we are told we live in.The open letter calls on the government to review how students are impacted ldquoto allow for more support and to allow families to lt themselves out of the trap of poverty and low paid jobs.It states: ldquoSurely it is in the governmentrsquos interests to re-evaluate thisthey truly want to reduce child poverty, increase upward mobility and prove that we are not the socially closed society that it is increasingly looking like.Ms Paige, who has been campaigning on the issue in her role as president, said the situation at the moment is ldquounacceptable.She said last night: ldquoUniversal Credit has fundamentally disregarded students in the way it calculates student income. This has been felt by students and their representatives across the country, as the -plus signatories of this letter demonstrate.One St Andrews student, Sandra Mitchell, a -year-old single mother, said that after she started her history and inity course at St Andrews, she lost about pound a month in benefit money.Ms Mitchell, from Dundee, said: ldquoIrsquom the only person in the household who brings in any income. Irsquom left with just my student income as I donrsquot get any universal credit. Under the previous system I wouldrsquove still received child tax credits but under the new system Irsquove lost out on that.ldquoIt means that itrsquos very dficult to focus on your studies when yoursquore constantly worrying about finances, when you take into account your travel, your lunches, and books that can be very costly.A DWP spokesman said: ldquoIf people make a choice to move into education then it follows that they move across to the financial system students use, including maintenance grants and loans.

But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

Mr Mundellrsquos wan smiles and empty words about doing the best for Scotland as the Government he is a member of readies itself to push us off the no-deal Brexit clf, is as astonishing as it is appalling.

The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development.

We do not have a huge amount of knowledge of the Picts in terms of historical sources and what we do have is mostly from external ones.ldquoTherersquos late Roman writings and Irish and Anglo-Saxon sources but all we have from the Picts themselves is the lsquoking listrsquo.ldquoThey are most likely a collection of the Iron Age tribes which lived in Scotland at the time slowly coming together to form a cohesive kingdom.The project set out to investigate sites close to long-standing symbol stones to carry out fresh excavations in the hope of forming a better understanding of this mysterious people.A major discovery was made at Rhynie in Aberdeenshire, a landlocked village south of Huntly on the A, where eight carved Pictish stones ndash among them the carved ldquoRhynie man and the Craw Stane ndash had long been known about.The Rhynie man stone carvingArchaeologists now believe the site was home to a major royal enclosure comprised of several buildings, one of them constructed from massive curved oak beams, surrounded by a wooden wall four to five metres high.But it was fragments from Roman vases known as amphorae recovered in digging work which provided the most tantalising clue to the reach of the Picts.Vase pieces have been found at only three other sites in Scotland, including Dumbarton Rock, the seat of the ancient rulers of the Kingdom of Strathclyde.:Secrets of the Picts rise from the ashes of Viking raidThose found at Rhynie indicate it may well have been the dwelling place of a high-status Pictish ruler whose world stretched far beyond the north-east.The few records that remain also suggest the Picts may have had a far more unied kingdom than their neighbours to the west, organised along lines seen in Europe and to the south in England.Mr Noble said: ldquoRhynie is the most northern site these fragments have been found at, and they show that the Picts were part of a trading network which stretched far and wide into the Roman world.ldquoThe Picts are quite unusual in having an over-kingship of such an extensive area. In Ireland at this time therersquos more than  or so petty kings ruling very small kingdoms but what we see in Pictland is something thatrsquos a lot more like the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.ldquoThese are not a people on the edge of Europe but one thatrsquos developing like its southern and eastern neighbours.ldquoThere are influences of western art and a great deal of commerce. The Picts are very much a part of wider European developments.:Dig may unlock secrets of ancient Pictish carvingMore recently, the projectrsquos archaeologists probed the symbol stones themselves and concluded they contain writing as well as art. Crucially, they claim, this developed in the third century and was likely influenced through contact with the written word of the Romans.It is now believed the symbols carved into the stones were a form of naming system that communicated the identities of Pictish people and places and are the last surviving fragments of their language.A Pictish symbol stone discovered in the River Din near DyceMr Noble said: ldquoThese stones occur at prominent places in the land and on Christian Cross slabs on graves, most likely telling something about the personrsquos rank and identity. They were probably developed in a similar way to Ogham script in Ireland and Scandinavian runes.While the Northern Picts Project has gone a long way to re-evaluating their place in Scottish history, much still needs to be done to flesh out the picture.Current work centres on a large fort at Burghead on the Moray coast. This site, which was destroyed in the ninth century, may hold clues to the eventual fate of the Picts.While there is evidence of a slow merging with the western kingdom of the Gaels, the people of the north-east were facing a new threat: the Vikings.Mr Noble added: ldquoThe Vikings were bad news for just about everybody in this period. But therersquos still much we need to know before we can say where the Picts went."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-is-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-magic-or-mince","story":"Three, two, one went the countdown and there was Chvrches singer Lauren Mayberry singing a number which would not be out of place in the next Bond film.

Why are councils getting cuts when there is more money in the pot In my experience the only people who are taken in by this are SNP politicians, in particular SNP councillors, who will happily whistle the ldquomore money theme as a musical accompaniment, while casting their votes to cut vital services for their own constituents.

No matter, it seems that, the SNP consistently misses its own targets in the critical public services that are supposed to be its priority, just as long as its leader can get onto the world stage and seek to undermine the UK and our place within it.Keith Howell,White Moss, West Linton, Peeblesshire.CHRISTOPHER H Jonescontends that the SNP is \"driven by Holyrood well, the Holyrood Parliament is elected by voters in Scotland, and accountable to voters in Scotland, unlike the position at Westminster where Scotland has a mere  seats out of .

Bitter internal squabblings in the Conservative and Labour parties have now boiled over, at least a dozen MPs have left their parties, more are expected to leave, and others, including government ministers, are threatening to leave.Mr Jones argues that within the Unionist parties \"whilst some members may be disenchanted with a party position at least they are free to go their own way\" indeed, they have gone their own way right out of their parties and formed their own group.

The only old fogies on opening night were Jack and Victor, but even their show, Still Game, is a big hit with the under s.Read more: The Question Time row raises profound questions for the BBCThe big question is whether this strategy is going to work and I have my doubts. Recently, I spent a few days with my godchildren who are aged between nine and , and what was striking about how they spent their time was that they didnrsquot switch on the BBC. Not once. For someone like me, or anyone  in their s who grew up with Basil Brush and Blue Peter, thatrsquos pretty extraordinary: young people arenrsquot watching the BBC regularlyat all. The question is: will they change their habits as they get older or is it the BBC that will have to change For the moment, the makers of the new channel are proceeding on the basis that they can still attract young viewers. But whether they can or not is just the first of the hurdles the channel is going to have to overcome, the second being whether they can attract an audience in the way that matters. In the old days, TV was about overnight viewing figures ndash bums on seats ndash but the director of BBC Scotland, Donalda MacKinnon, has already been managing expectations by saying the new channel will not be about the size of the audience. Thatrsquos not-very-subtle code for: the traditional viewing figures for the new channel are going to be very low.The question is whether it matters and, in a way, it doesnrsquot because viewing figures are not as important as they once were - itrsquos just as important that a programme does well on iPlayer and social media. That means that, to prove its worth, the channel is going to have to do well online and produce programmes that are shared by a younger audience. The fact that one of the early programmes is about the make-up artist Jamie Genevieve is a clue to where wersquore going here ndash she has more than a million Instagram followers.Where it gets dficult is whether the BBC can rise to this challenge, which leads to the third hurdle: the balance problem. The BBC is proud of its policy on balance but, as I pointed out in my column on Question Time the other day, the BBCrsquos idea of balance has led it to the ludicrous position that, for every environmental scientist on TV, there has to be a climate-change denier. ldquoBalance can also lead to some very dull TV and thatrsquos not going to help the new channel get its news reports shared online. People increasingly like news with attitude whereas the BBC does sensible. Sensible doesnrsquot go viral.The fourth, and perhaps the biggest, hurdle for the new channel is also, in a way, the reason for its creation in the first place. For years, there was pressure from the SNP for a Scottish Six news programe and the new channel is the end result ndash in other words, itrsquos the BBCrsquos response to a political argument rather than audience demand. The problem for the BBC, though, is the Scottish nationalists who most loudly demanded change are also the least likely to watch the new coverage because of its perceived bias ndash most of the talk among this group is about the reasons they wonrsquot watch.Read more: Of course the BBC is biasedThe recent row over an alleged plant in the audience of Question Time has not helped in this regard. There has also been very little evidence that the BBC is willing to seriously consider whether theyrsquore getting it right on alleged bias. In fact, Hayley Valentine, the editor of the new Scottish Nine news programme, made the extraordinary statement that she did not know ldquoa single journalist who brought any bias to work with them which is anti-logic of the worst kind: BBC journalists have bias just like any other human does, which is why the BBC has rules to try to overcome it.The allegation of bias also has serious consequences for the Scottish version of Question Time which is doomed to death by a thousand nationalist cuts before it even starts. The programme also faces the fth and final hurdle, which is money. BBC Scotland has already admitted they cannot afford to take their Scottish Question Time around the country which will not only make the channel feel Glasgow-centric , it will highlight the fact that the new channel simply doesnrsquot have the money it needs.Can the new channel get over these hurdles  Possibly, but remember previous experiments by the BBC. BBC Choice, which included regional iations for Scotland ndash axed in . The Scottish version of Newsnight ndash axed in . Scotland , which had average viewing figures as low as , ndash axed after less than three years. Perhaps the new BBC channel will be dferent to all of those, but it has something of the same feel doesnrsquot it  An attempt to be dferent without any great ability to be interesting.

Jimmy Kimmel may be a big name in the US but means little where yet was the host in .That might have been a reason why the ceremonys live audience last year was the lowest in in Oscars history, averaging . million viewers, down from . million in .What we ended up with was a st Academy Awards ceremony that felt less bloated but actually ran for about the same three-houras its predecessors.In the absence of a monologue, the ceremony kicked off with original Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor rolling back the years, joined by Adam Lambert for a mini-medley of the bands classic songs featuring We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You, bringing the star-studded Oscars audience to its feet.It was the music rather than the laughs that stole the show.The immaculately choreographed performance of the Oscar winning original song Shallow by actor director Bradley Cooper and singer actress Lady Gaga was perhaps the most memorable moment of the night.With cameras placed at the back of the stage, the curtain lted and crew pusha grand piano into place with an array of blinding headlamps kissing the empty stage leaving viewers wondering what on earth was going on.Then the duo stephand-in-hand from their seats in the audience, Cooper helping Lady Gaga, whose shimmering, sleek Celine dress was a potential hazard, up the stairs to the stage.With the TV audiencestill with a back-of-stage view, Cooper sings, and Gaga stands staring into his eyes before taking her position behind the piano to play her part in this most intimate of love songs.Cooper then joins her on her piano stool and they become cocooned, steamily cheek to cheek for the denouement. It all feels so spine-tinglingly real, you do wonder what was going through the mind of Coopers partner, Russian supermodel Irina Shayk.They exitto a standing ovation, but it was, of course, meat and drink for the gossipmongers. Even Spice Girl Mel B who was a guest on the special broadcast said she was left feeling ldquouncomfortable for Coopers girlfriend.It was of course, supposed to be an act, an exercise of romantic artice, and a spin on their starring roles in the Star Is Born remake. If you like, it was four minutes encapsulating what moviemaking is about - making you believe.The laughs were less scripted.British actress Olivia Colman has come a long way from the days of her understated role as a scruffy and unstable love interest of the socially awkward and despondent loan manager played by David Mitchell in Peep Show.Since then she has become a serial winner of awards for her acting culminating in her first, surely of many, best actress Oscar for her role as as Queen Anne, the erratic and gout-ridden monarch in The Favourite.Her endearingly scatterbrained and scattergun speech has to go down as one of the most bizarre, emotional yet hilarious acceptances in recent years.She began by wiping the tears from eyes and said: \"Ooooh, its genuinely quite stressful... this is hilarious. Got an Oscar.\"In a typicallyoff-the-cuff acceptance speech, Colman said she wanted to ldquothanks lots of people and thatshe forgot anyone she would find them later and give them ldquoa massive snog.Colman said how shocked she was to be there, having once worked as a cleaner and then blew a raspberry as she was asked to wind up.She also thanked Glenn Close, who was widely tipped as the likely best actress winner, saying she had been ldquoher idol for so long this is not how I wanted it to be.She went on to thank her children Finn,  and Hall, , adding she ldquohopes they are at home and watching, because ldquothis isnrsquot going to happen again.The Oscars have major flaws, of course, and viewers have to swallow the conceit that the best movies appear to be American.And, of course, the winning films are often worthy and issue-driven with action blockbusters, comedy and horror barely getting a look in.. So the best picture winner was race relations drama Green Book and included among the eight nominated best picture gongs are BlacKkKlansman, a movie about an African-American detective inflitrating the Ku Klux Klan, and Roma, a Mexican drama about the Mexican director Alfonso Cuaroacuten upbringing in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City.Its asthe Academy are making a conscious effort to love Mexico in the midst of Donald Trumps determination to pledge to build a border wall.If that was not obvious politicisation over art, then Spike Lees comments while accepting the Best Adapted Screenplay award for BlacKkKlansman definitely was.He implored Americans to praise ancestors \"stolen from Mother Africa\" who have \"built this country into what it is today along with the genocide of its native people\".He said during Sunday nightrsquos ceremony: ldquoThe  presidential election is around the corner.

With the story breaking around pm, the show had a real opportunity to steal a march on its pm competitors, but despite going to dedicated correspondents in Westminster and Brussels, nothing new emerged.Labours backing for second voteBack in the studio, both Curran and Geissler tackled Labour MSP Neil Findlay over Jeremy Corbynrsquos shting position on Europe. The interview was shouty and unedying, with lots of pen pointing and talking over each other, and that was just the anchors. Findlay wisely left them to it and sailed serenely on.The exclusive report duly arrived and it was into the buying of cheap, potentially deadly pills on social media. Scotland and a drugs story: jeez, what were the chances of that Next was an update on the investigation into the death of Kirsty Maxwell in Benidorm, including an interview with her father. This was followed by a report on medication to prevent HIV infection, then it was over to James Cook, chief news correspondent, in Reykjavik, where he was asking tourists their views on Brexit. So far, so unremarkable.But Cook had also landed an interview with the countryrsquos Prime Minister, Katrin Jakobsdottir, who spoke well on what it was like to be an independent country yet still have a trading relationship with the EU. This was more like it: an item with obvious relevance to Scotland tackled in an intelligent, engaging way.Sports presenter Amy Irons had a joint interview with Alex McLeish and Gregor Townsend about the pressures of managing the national teams, which was going fine till the anchors joined the trio on the sofa and, as with the Findlay interview, the conversation became garbled. BBC over-manning strikes again.The lighter stuff at the end was tired. The disappearing Scottie dogs story had been in the Sunday and Monday papers, ditto the interview with the young Scot who won The Greatest Dancer on Saturday. The last item, about the Oscars, must have been terribly interesting to the one person left on Earth who did not know Olivia Colman had won best actress.Come pm it had been a busy hour but a long one. This was a competent but underwhelming debut. It didnrsquot feel fast moving and agenda setting or whatever the hype had promised. Nor, the Cook report aside, was it very Scottish.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution.

We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time.

This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupMonday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I. These tanks were built for the supply of fuel to warships and they were in use until the mid-s.Mrs Brown said like many street artists, the person who carried out the work may wish to remain anonymous and even be fearful of prosecution.ldquoI just donrsquot know. But what they have done is quite beautul. I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks. But none of the bombs exploded although they cause a major spillage of oil.Mrs Brown said she understood there were plans to remove some tanks to build houses.

Academics from the UK and Germany have created new maps forecasting how the species will spread.The team used computer modelling to predict favourable habitats for future invasions, based on present occurrence patterns.The UK is expected to become a hotspot, but the Mediterranean islands and parts of South America, South Africa, south-west Australia and New Zealand are also expected to see an influx of the spiders due to mild climatic conditions.“These are areas that are home to a wide range of vulnerable native species, so the potential introduction of Steatoda nobilis, which can overcome prey much larger than its own size, is quite worrying,” said Professor Rainer Breitling, from the University of Manchester.Increased sightings in the UK and Ireland have already sparked panic after  widows were discovered in large numbers in public spaces.Infestations sparked the closure of several schools in east London last year.People are advised to keep clear of the spiders, but the researchers are urging the public not to panic as a bite is comparable with the sting from a wasp or bee.And though its bite is more toxic than that from any native British spider, there have been few confirmed cases and none of serious injury as a direct result.“There is no need to be concerned,” Prof Breitling said.“These are not typically house spiders and in most places where they are found live alongside people unnoticed.”The biologist added: “Although its bite can be very painful, comparable to a severe bee or wasp sting, there are no confirmed cases of serious medical consequences from a noble  widow bite.”The noble  widow – Steatoda nobilis – is one of three  widow species occurring in the UK. Measuring up to .cm across with a pea-sized body, it can be recognised by its shiny dark brown abdomen with white half-moon marking.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ferrari revs up ahead of edinburgh apprenticeship showcase","story":"Ferrari is gearing up for a series of open days to showcase UK apprenticeship opportunities with the famous Italian sports car brand.All  of the company’s official UK dealers, including Graypaul Edinburgh, will be taking part in the initiative, which coincides with National Apprenticeship Week .

There is a long way to go for it to be anything like it.For one thing there are, as yet, no Scottish or Welsh MPs involved, it is not a British political phenomenon but a peculiarly English affair.Secondly there are, thus far, no big hitters involved. This is the defection of some colourful rent-a-quote self-publicists but no current or former cabinet secretaries have yet joined in the stampede that became a trickle.When the Social Democratic Party was established in  by a break away from the Labour Party, the ringleaders were all seasoned former Cabinet members of stature and reputation beloved by BBC producers. Roy Jenkins had been Home Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and President of the European CommissionDavid Owen had been Foreign Secretary Shirley Williams Education Secretary and Bill Rodgers Transport secretary. They attracted  other Labour MPs and one Conservative, including three Welsh and two Scottish MPs. No one could doubt it was a British political force and that it carried serious government experience and intellectual heft.Today’s independent group enjoys no such reputation, but instead is characterised by politicians who originally stood for election in  on manesto commitments to respect the EU referendum result and deliver a Brexit that meant leaving the Single Market and Customs Union. They have been betraying those pledges without a blush of embarrassment or scintilla of shame pretty much since ing to Westminster.Many were also especially vocerousrejecting calls for a second referendum but now campaign for it as a panacea for all our ills.Thus we have a party-in-waiting claiming for themselves a “centrist” democratic legitimacy yet composed of MPs that have, each and everyone, already betrayed the solemn pledges made to their electorates at the last election – and now wish to overturn the biggest decision taken by voters in the UK since universal suffrage was achieved.Further, the group lacks serious politicians of reputation and proven leadership stature – and is limited in reach only to England. Those are hardly convincing credentials for a new “third force” or what is necessary to “break the mould” and create a realignment where parties more accurately reflect competing policies or philosophies – rather than trying to be all things to all voters, as is the case currently.Nor has the independent group brought a much needed and refreshing honesty to political debate. Instead Anna Soubry launched into invective based on a  analysis alleging the removal of Tory prime ministers by the party’s Eurosceptic right wing the infiltration and takeover of Conservative Party associations pushing for deselections and the Prime Minister being in the clutches of the pro-Brexit European Research Group MPs.Even a quick glance at historical references show Thatcher was removed by her party’s Europhile wing John Major had to resign after losing to Blair following his administration’s ERM-led recession and sleaze scandals while David Cameron broke his promise to stay on after the EU referendum by walking out after losing it at the hands of the British people. There was no right wing putsch on any occasion. Writing on ConservativeHome website Mark Wallace systematically demolished Soubry’s claims about entryism as wholly lacking in evidence, while Theresa May’s premiership is without a doubt the most left-of-centre Tory administration since Harold Macmillan’s sixty years ago.There is an obvious answer to the dead-end that confronts the independent group and that is for the Cabinet’s whingers that are forever threatening to resign from government over leaving without an EU-imposed deal to actually deliver on their threats – but not just to abandon their ministerial positions but their party too. What’s stopping the likes of Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clarke and Scottish Secretary David Mundell following through to the logical conclusion of their position  There’s not a cigarette paper between them and Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen or Sarah Wollaston. Like Soubry, who previously defected to the SDP in , Mundell left the Conservatives then too and was an SDP councillor until . Is it loyalty to the Tory party or personal satisfaction from holding high office that tells them to continue asministers  Mundell in particular has been here before, threatening to resign last year, then justying remaining in his post, but with his credibility holed below the water line as a result. Of course banging on about leaving without a deal is all rather staged. The government has a deal, it’s just that parliament convincingly voted against it. Were Labour and the SNP to back the EU-May deal it could possibly pass. Despite all the name-calling directed at the Brexiteer Tories the fact that we are still talking about possibly leaving without a deal is entirely down to highly partisan party politics. Meanwhile, the Conservative loyalists in the European Reform Group – showing loyalty to their party’s manesto they were elected on – have repeatedly sought ways to deliver a deal. The latest, a new version of the “Malthouse Compromise” tries to help the Prime Minister in her negotiations and ensure that even leaving without a deal can be achieved with goodwill on all sides. By comparison, were Rudd, Mundell and their fellow murmurers, to stop crying wolf and join the independent group then we would at least get the realignment and formation of a true centrist party that many Blairites, Liberal Democrats and Tory Wets keep signalling should come about, but never quite arrives.It would of course mean the collapse of the government, it would mean a general election and it would mean the Conservatives, Labour, and the Independent Group together with the Liberal Democrats, having to realign into three more coherent groups. They would need distinctly dferent offerings and be absolutely honest this time about what they would do about Brexit – as well as the economy, the housing shortage, benefit reforms and all the other issues that really matter to people.They would need to saythey would have another EU referendum and demonstrate they would keep their word this time – and similarly state how they would treat demands for a second Scottish referendum too. Crucially, the realigned parties would need to say how they would form a government in the event of there being another hung parliament.Brexit or realignment  Which choice will May’s critics choose ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"oscars 2019 hollywood reveals its true colours once again dr claire jenkins","story":"Another year, another Oscars Ceremony. Red-carpeted self-congratulations, the popping of flashes and the anticipation of the popping of corks at the many after parties for the rich and famous. And, once again, another Academy Awards in which no women were mentioned in the important category of best director, writes Dr Claire Jenkins.In the  years that the awards have been running, only five women have been nominated for this coveted award – and only one, Kathryn Bigelow, has come away with the statuette: this represents about one per cent of nominees and winners. It’s a shockingly low statistic, even when you take into account that a mere eight per cent of Hollywood’s top  films in  were directed by women. In  America’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found Hollywood to be guilty of discrimination against female directors, but as yet there have been no signicant shts in the number of women directing.But while there is clearly much to do, there may be some small tremors discernible on Hollywood’s Geiger counter. Take Mimi Leder‘s newest film On the Basis of Sex, about the career of US Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Leder was effectively ostracised by Hollywood after the commercial failure of Pay it Forward , so herto directing with a biopic of one of America’s most prominent feminist icons suggests that Hollywood is softening in its treatment of women on, and off, screen.Leder’sto the director’s chair comes alongside the impressive success of Ava DuVernay, who has been breaking ground for women of colour in the film industry. DuVernay became the first African-American woman to make over USm at the American domestic box office with A Wrinkle in Timeand was subsequently offered a m deal with Warner Bros. This deal came despite the film’s lukewarm critical reception, and claims that it was helped to box office success by The Incredibles , with which it was paired at ious drive-ins in the US. It should be noted that DuVernay’s deal with Warner Bros was to develop television content. It is in the television and streaming sectors that women seem to have more opportunities. It was as a television director that Leder has been working since her film career faltered, gaining acclaim for her work on The Leftovers, and DuVernay has oscillated between television and film – taking on a number of producing roles for the small screen.: Oscars : Olivia Colman named best actress in shock winThe current Hollywood climate continues to favour male filmmakers, with its penchant for high-octane action blockbusters and superhero movies that are more often than not films for – and about – men. Coverage of the forthcoming Captain Marvel movie may be trying to draw on the film’s feminist credentials – with its female lead and female director – but Anna Boden is only one half of the directorial team . So despite Marvel boss Kevin Feige’s claims that “many” of the upcoming Marvel films will be directed by women, as yet no movie from what is known as the “Marvel Cinematic Universe”has a female director, although Australian director Cate Shortland is expected to helm the Black Widow film.EvenMCU and other action-producers continue to hire women directors, though, this will not necessarily affect the Oscars – Black Panther currently standing as the only MCU movie to be nominated.Big-budget, but low-brow action movies are generally overlooked during awards season – instead it’s those films that we might term “Indiewood”, independent-style films funded or distributed by specialist arms of the major studios, that tend to be celebrated. In , two of the three English language films nominated for best director were distributed by major studios, or their specialist arms. The Favourite was distributed by Fox Searchlight, and BlacKkKlansman was distributed by Focus Features, a subsidiary of Universal.Independent filmmaking has, historically, offered more opportunities for women directors, and therefore the lack of women nominated for the Best Director award seems even more pronounced. Although figures for women working within the independent sector are less well publicised, the Celluloid Ceiling Report suggested that women are better represented in the independent sector, making up  per cent of the directors of narrative features screened at festivals in  and .: Academy refuses to pull James Bulger film from Oscars despite family’s pleaStatistics such as these demonstrate that women directors are working in the American industry, but the big studios are failing to hire them and the Academy is failing to recognise them.Women directors slated for nods this awards season all made films that fall into the independent or Indiewood category: Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here and Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me.Anne Fletcher’s latest film Dumplin’ was independently produced and distributed by Netflix. Fletcher had box office success with mainstream rom-coms including  Dressesand The Proposalbut after the failure of Hot Pursuit it appears that she too has been pushed out of the mainstream.That Dumplin’ was distributed by Netflix, and You Were Never Really Here was distributed by Amazon Studios, demonstrates that there are dferent outlets for women within the changing media culture but there is still a lack of support for women in the mainstream – the big studios. And even those women who have had success in Hollywood are rarely recognised for their achievements.The death of Penny Marshall in December was met with a public outpouring of grief via social media and popular press. She was hailed as a trailblazer as the first woman to make over m at the American domestic box office with Big . But Marshall is not a household name. Big is remembered as the film that made Tom Hanks’ name, not Marshall’s. Marshall is just the first in a long string of women who have changed Hollywood, but they are not recognised for their achievements.The American film industry must do better – in hiring women directors, in rewarding women directors and in highlighting and protecting their legacies.Dr Claire Jenkins is a lecturer in film and television studies at Leicester University.

All it does is precisely what the word ‘delay’ says.”AskedMPs might be asked to vote on additional assurances over the controversial Irish border backstop on  March, before they have been formally signed off by EU leaders at a summit a week later, the Prime Minister told reporters: “It is possible to do it either way.”European Council president Donald Tusk revealed he discussed legal details of extending the Article  withdrawal process in talks with Mrs May when they met on Sunday in Egypt.Mr Tusk said delaying the UK’s withdrawal is now a “rational solution”, warning that the only alternativeMPs cannot agree a deal is “a chaotic Brexit”.And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to “wake up”.Mr Rutte said: “We are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.“Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.”In a furious Brexit diplomatic effort on the fringes of a summit focused on Middle East cooperation, Mrs May also met with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Italy’s Giuseppe Conte.The Prime Minister confirmed that Brexit negotiators willto Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.: Lib Dems won’t back ing to EUShe will make a statement to the Commons this afternoon ahead of votes on Brexit tomorrow, knowing that senior cabinet ministers and up to  of her MPs could rebel to back amendments ruling out a no-deal scenario.At the weekend, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, and Justice Secretary David Gauke threatened to back an amendment put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin, which seeks to block a no-deal through legislationthere no Brexit agreement in place by  March - a day after Mrs May’s deadline for a ‘meaningful vote’.The government source said any ministers who backed the amendment “will be expected to resign”.With the threat of further resignations by and the party losing support in the polls, Mr Corbyn told a meeting of his parliamentarians that Labour would “do everything in our power to prevent No Deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal.: David Mundell: SNP want no-deal Brexit“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Labour is in talks with backbench MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson over an amendment they are proposing that would approve Mrs May’s deal, but put it to a public vote. The Labour leadership would rather voters be presented with a choice between its own deal and remaining in the EU, as it tries to strike a balance between pro- and anti-Brexit opinion amongst its supporters.The Kyle-Wilson amendment is not expected to be tabled tomorrow, but could be pushed forward on the day of the meaningful vote in March.Last night the shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour would seek a “deal or remain” referendum.Politicians and campaigners backing a People’s Vote issued a cautious welcome to the announcement. Edinburgh MP Ian Murray, one of its strongest advocates, said the announcement was “signicant progress”, but said campaigners had to “win the arguments to get a majority in Parliament to win a public vote with the option to remain”.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “A referendum with no remain option would be ludicrous”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vince cable scottish independence disruption would be greater than brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A second Scottish independence referendum would mean even greater \"uncertainty and disruption\" than the current Brexit turmoil, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince cable has said.And has dismissed criticism of the Lib Dems support for a Peoples Vote - while rejecting a second independence referendum.SNP Deputy leader Keith Brown said independence would be the \"opposite\" of Brexit in a keynote speech in Aberdeen at the weekend and Nicola Sturgeon is set to outline her plans for a second vote on leaving the UK in the coming weeks.Read more: Lib Dems leader heralds end of Tory-Labour duopoly and People’s Vote victoryCable was in Scotland at the weekend for the Lib Dems Spring conference and rejected claims that the breakdown of Westminster politics over Brexit means Scots are now ready to listen to the case for independence.\"In a way, I wouldve thought the dynamic was in the opposite direction,\" Cable said.\u2028\"When you can see the chaos and upheaval that has been created by trying to leave the European Union with which we have very strong ties, but not overwhelming, the fact that business has just stopped investing. \u2028\"There has been very, very disruptive consequences.

Instead Theresa May#s unilateral decision to shunt this week#s meaningful vote to the very brink of Brexit was delivered yesterday in the snug surroundings of a jet bound for Egypt. Nice.Theresa May’s casual rearrangement of an agreed schedule is disappointing, duplicitous, disruptive and unreliable. But who cares  Bad faith is seen as a slightly regretted but absolutely inevitable part of our “robust” political process.Maybe though, it highlights something important but generally missed. The electorate has allowed Britain’s political class to act like spoilt brats for far too long.Most ordinary members of the public possess a basic courtesy, sense of fairness, ability to empathise and willingness to listen. Yet these traits are found nowhere in the behaviour of Government or indeed the vascillating opposition. So who is more likely to find a resolution to the current Brexit crisis -- axe-grinding politicians or fair-minded citizens  That question was debated this weekend by lawyers, activists and academics at a conference entitled, “Remaking the UK Constitution” in Oxford. Many speakers expressed the hope that an extension to Brexit might buy the time and political space needed to build faith in and pressure for a novel democratic solution -- handing the whole sorry mess back to citizens’ assemblies.The concept is unfamiliar in Scotland and may sound home-spun or just plain whacky. But the Irish and Canadians can testy that well-facilitated groups of randomly chosen citizens have found popular solutions to thorny problems – and have conferred upon them a sense of civic legitimacy, generally absent in the formal political arena.In Dublin during , a Constitutional Convention met eight times to produce outline legislation on equal marriage. It echoed the public mood so well, that the proposal got  per cent backing at the referendum two years later. In  another randomly selected Citizens Assembly recommended a referendum on removing the eighth amendment of the Constitution, which banned abortion in almost all circumstances.Despite fears the Citizens Assembly had gone too far, . per cent of the population backed its proposal, proving that ordinary voters can successfully resolve issues, which have been absolutely intractable for politicians. The  Assembly members were chosen at random to reflect the Irish population in terms of age, gender, social class and geography. They included pro-lers, pro-choicers and undecideds and heard from people on both sides of the abortion debate, including medical, legal and ethical specialists, and people giving personal testimonies. Members had the chance to discuss amongst themselves, to listen and reflect on the views of others on  weekends, over  months between November  and April .The technique has unquestionably worked in Ireland. Could it work here In January, the campaign group Compasscalled for a citizens’ assembly with  representative members of the public picked at random to hear evidence, produce recommendations and break the Brexit deadlock. Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Lisa Nandy picked up the idea and tabled an amendment to Theresa May’s deal suggesting citizens assemblies could disrupt the bad habits of Brexit which include “kicking issues into the long grass, placing party interests over the national interest and assuming the public are unable to cope with hard choices.” But the idea got very little coverage, only  MP signatures, and some criticism from CA believers worried that the mandate was too narrow to tackle the massive social and constitutional problems underpinning Brexit, the timescale far too short and that a citizens’ assembly held under these circumstances, without genuine Government buy-in could easily become emergency elastoplast for a near terminal political condition. So the Creasy Nandy amendment fell last month - but now, with an extension of Article  now looking fairly likely, it could be resurrected – given time and cross party goodwill.This latter commodity however is in very short supply at Westminster – an institution so stuck in its ways and mired in such uncritical self belief that MPs seem unlikely to admit their own inept custodianship of British democracy has helped drive the Brexit vote and drive away any reasonable resolution. So citizens’ assemblies may have their first substantial UK outing north of the border instead.Last summer the SNP held four National Assemblies which let members think through issues including the vexed question of the currency to be used in an independent Scotland. The gatherings weren’t properly resourced, randomly selected and didn’t meet long enough to hear and debate evidence from a wide range of experts. But it was a start.In December, Professor Alan Miller, who chairs the First Minister’s Advisory Group on Human Rights Leadership took things further. He published a report about safeguarding human rights in Scotland post Brexit. The report’s second recommendation is, “A public participatory process as a vital part of preparation for and implementation of an Act of the Scottish Parliament providing human rights leadership.” In other words, the Scottish Government,it accepts the recommendations, could soon create the first Citizens’ Assembly in Britain to tackle a really substantial issue – developing a devolved human rights framework ora written constitution including a Bill of Rights. This prospect is causing a flutter amongst academics and campaigners south of the border. At the Oxford conference, many speakers openly encouraged Scotland to pioneer citizens’ assmeblies for the whole UK - others exhorted a swt move towards a second independence referendum as the only event catalcysmic enough to waken up the English political class.SNP members including Joanna Cherry MP will propose a summer of properly funded and randomly selected citizens juries at the SNP’s April conference, to bring together Yes, No and undecided voters to create their own vision of a new Scotland – tackling every relevant constitutional question from the voting system to the currency.The Edinburgh MSP tweeted yesterday “If Article  is extended, the SNP could use the time to build consensus, and use Citizens Assemblies to answer the big policy questions.”Is that likely  Successive Holyrood governments have created a substantial consultation culture – but handing voters the power to frame solutions would open up a whole new energising democratic dimension.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year.

It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PORTREE-BRAES-TRUST-FIONA-AND-SOPHIE-2.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1433384.jpg--.jpg?1549442071000\n","title":"cambridge house schoolfriends collaborate for charity single","story":"A BALLYMENA writer and his singer schoolfriend have teamed up to release a new single, the proceeds of which will be donated to a mental health charity.Daryl Ball and Marc Little both attended Cambridge House and both became involved in the arts in later le - but are now joining forces thanks to a chance encounter with a book.Daryl, who records as a solo artist as well as being a member of the Ballymena band Stripped, explained: An old schoolfriend Marc Little had a book of poetry published in .Its called Out Of Darkness and it was a very personal collection by Marc dealing with dficult yet common subjects like anxiety and depression.I bought a copy last year and really enjoyed his writing style as well as being very moved by the honesty in his poetry. “They inspired me to write a song on subject.I contacted Marc to ask would he mindI used words from two of his poems to create a new song.He was excited by the idea of working together and I agreed to send a rough demo to make sure he was happy with my treatment of it before proceeding.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school.

He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”.

There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry.

It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37851867.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/tusk_may_.jpg","title":"brexit formal talks between may and tusk on delaying uk exit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And that is why I feel the chances are that won’t happen,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"birmingham pub bombing inquests start with minutes silence","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_cbc-af-d--abafcda_EmailThe long-awaited inquests into the deaths of  people in the  IRA Birmingham pub bombings have begun with a minute’s silence for the victims..pushThe coroner Sir Peter Thornton told jurors they would hear evidence of how the two bomb blasts ripped apart two pubs on what was a “perfectly ordinary evening”, in Birmingham.He told them there would be evidence alleging British security forces may have had some forewarning about the attacks, widely thought to have been carried out by the provisional IRA, including an “over-heard” conversation which took place in prison two weeks before the bombings.Sir Peter, continuing his opening statement, added that the inquests would not deal with the issue of who planted the bombs, adding that was a “task of police, prosecutors and the criminal courts”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Mulberry Bush pub He added that although a single hearing, lasting up to six weeks, the inquests would deal with “ separate people,  separate lives lost from two terrible events”.As well as those killed,  were injured in the blasts, which were carried out at the height of an IRA bombing campaign in the West Midlands, the jury was told.A third bomb, jurors heard, was planted near the Barclays Bank on the Hagley Road but failed to properly detonate that night.The coroner said that there had been “over ” incidents involving bombs and incendiaries “in and around Birmingham” in  and , but that after the pub blasts “the campaign in the West Midlands stopped”.He told the six women and five men of the jury it would be a matter for them whether the IRA called off its Midlands campaign because of the “outrage of civilian deaths on this scale” or “some other reason”.Sir Peter said: “This is something that the city of Birmingham has suffered now for many years.“While the inquests will inevitably focus on those who died we must also remember many other lives were and continue to be affected.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Tavern In The Town pub, which was in a basement, was devastated by the blast Jurors, sitting at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, were told they would hear evidence from only a few eyewitnesses of those there on the evening, because some were “no longer alive”.He added: “They will be doing their best to recollect events accurately, but we all know memory will sometimes have gaps.“Recollection may sometimes be distorted or inaccurate, it may be correct.”Sir Peter said “nobody has been successfully prosecuted for the attack”, and that the only men ever to stand trial, the Birmingham Six, were freed on appeal in .He also said: “Nobody is on trial here, an inquest does not decide matters of criminal or civil liability, and this is not a question of attributing blame to any iniduals.”He told jurors who “may well be wondering why now”, that the original inquests were put aside in , with the start of the six men’s criminal trial.The former chief coroner for England and Wales added that there would be details of the so-called “forewarning issue”, and evidence the British authorities may have received information signalling there were to be bomb attacks.Among them, evidence of an alleged tip-off concerning a “possible conversation in a local prison nearly two weeks before the bombings”.Jurors would also hear an account of “evidence of a students’ visit to a police station the evening of the bombings, which was cancelled”.Detailing the chain of events that night, Sir Peter said that at .pm, the Birmingham Post and Mail newspaper received a coded bomb warning from a man “with an Irish accent” accompanied with the code word “double X”.The caller, ringing from a telephone box, spoke of a bomb in the city’s landmark Rotunda, and the tax office in New Street.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The aftermath of the blast at the Mulberry Bush, which was on the ground floor of the Rotunda Sir Peter said that the newspaper’s telephonist’s record of the message made no mention of pubs.The two bombs detonated in “massive explosions” between .pm and .pm, killing  on the night – eight in the Mulberry Bush, at the foot of the rotunda, and two outside the nightspot.Another nine died in the Tavern In The Town, which was a large pub in the basement of the same building as the tax office, King Edward’s House.Two died later of their injuries, with  of the victims under .Sir Peter said: “It was a normal Thursday evening in Birmingham, on November , .“It was not a weekend, but the pubs, two in particular, were busy enough and both quite popular with young people.”He added the premises were only some  yards away from one another.“At pm that evening, it was a perfectly ordinary evening in the two pubs, a film was showing at the Odeon cinema but just after .pm, all of that changed,” Sir Peter said.“Moments later there was an explosion at the Mulberry Bush, and just minutes later a second explosion at the Tavern In The Town.“They were massive explosions.”He told jurors: “After hearing the evidence you may conclude the bombs were brought and planted in such a way that extensive loss of le, injury and devastation, would have been caused.“They were planted in enclosed spaces in busy pubs, where there were many people.“You may be asked to determine whether those who died were unlawfully killed.”Hearings will continue on Tuesday and Wednesday with pen portraits of each of the victims, while on Thursday, the jurors will be taken to the former sites of the pubs – both since long gone.The inquests, which are being held in Birmingham, are the culmination of years of campaigning by relatives of the dead for a full account into the circumstances of what happened on the night of November , .\" width\"\" \"\"

It is not a satisfactory situation.Mr Billy McGivern, the Executiversquos area manager, admitted to councillors he was not happy with the situation in Ballynahinch and explained what had gone wrong with the Antrim Road site where  new homes were to have been built.ldquoWe did get planning permission for the site, he said. ldquoWe dug trial holes and the ground was satisfactory, but we were overtaken by discussions between the landowner and a private developer. The Housing Executive could not go through with a vesting order where a private developer is going ahead to build low cost housing.Mr McGivern promised that the Executive would press very strongly for sites in Ballynahinch and would be meeting with local planners in an attempt to come up with an answer.Ballynahinch councillor Mr Eddie McVeigh agreed there were problems obtaining sites, but he pointed out that the town was not scheduled for any new homes until - and he wanted other sites investigated as soon as possible.Cllr William Brown felt the now abandoned Antrim Road site was not all it was supposed to be anyway and it would have been foolish to proceed with a site which would have flooded, as it had done in the past.Cllr Francis Laverty wanted to know how the Executive could justy giving houses in Ballynahinch to people from Drumaness.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick firemen had another busy week, during which they attended several gorse fires and a chimney fire.On Saturday they were called to a gorse fire near Irish Street and the previous day they attended a Gorse Fire at Gallows Hill.On Thursday they were called out three times. The first was in the morning to St Johnrsquos Old Peoplersquos Home in Pound Lane, but they were not needed as the fire alarm had gone off accidentally.KILLOUGH mdash Killough Village Committee is pressing the Housing Executive to repair extensive storm damage caused to houses during the Christmas period.Damage caused to several of the new houses in the Castle Street area was one of the main problems discussed at a meeting of the committee recently.ldquoSerious storm damage to the roofs occurred, especially over the Christmas period, and this has not been fixed, the committee claims.ldquoLetters were sent to the Housing Executive and the contractor. The Executive sent a clerk of works to meet the contractorrsquos men at an arranged time, but they didnrsquot turn up, the committee said.ldquoThe occupants are very annoyed about this lack of interest and are now awaiting immediate action before dampness causes more serious damage.The committee has also hit out at the delay in truing to prove the ownership of the village harbour. They say it has ldquogone beyond a joke and intend sending a delegation to Down Council in a bid of finally resolve the ownership question.ldquoNothing can be done to start work on the sadly neglected harbour area until the present owner is contacted and public ownership is established. We firmly intend to pursue this matter until work has begun, the committee added.In the evening they attended a gorse fire on the Saul Road and several hours later they attended a chimney fire at Bobbie Hanveyrsquos photographic shop in Irish Street.ARDGLASS mdash Local planners have been asked to keep watch on a dredging operation currently underway at Ardglass harbour.The call has come from Down Council chairman Eddie McGrady, who is concerned not so much about the dredging but what is happening to the materials being taken from the harbour.Local councillor Dermot Curran is also concerned. He said that a tipping operation at the rear of the Seaview estate has not been properly maintained mdash much to the disgust of residents.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Three pupils from Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have won a Raleigh Boxer bicycle in a national lsquoWheels Projectrsquo open to Tufty Clubs.The bicycle, which will be used by the Tufty Club members at the school, was the top price in the - years section of the competition which was organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.Members of the schoolrsquos Tufty Club entered the competition, but it was the entries of Jason McKeown, Paul Beattie and Paul Chambers that clinched the top prize.COMBER mdash Comber police are investigating a number of thefts which took place in the town over the past week.Thieves entered the Rle Club in Railway Street and took away away a number of bottles of spirits on Wednesday evening.

We really are in need of fund raising from the public to help keep us going.Glebe House manager Diarmaid McGarrigle blames the rise in student overheads as one reason for the shortage of dedicated volunteers, calling it a ldquopoor indictment on our society.Mr McGarrigle said up until a few years ago Glebe House benefited from a ldquoteam of dedicated, driven and enthusiastic helpers.He said that is no longer the case because students were now having to seek paid employment to cover tuition fees and other costs.ldquoIt is a shame because young groups need volunteers from their own peer group to relate to, he explained.ldquoWe can offer volunteers a wide iety of skills to choose from as we have  acres of farm land, animals to look after and an environment to plan and maintain. We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals.

Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A consultation is being held on the councilrsquo website, while a drop-in session was held atSt Augustinersquos Parish Hall on January . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

What you guys are doing ndash leaving EU in this time of insecurity in the world, instability in EU ndash is the wrong decision.ldquoItrsquos four weeks until the end date and still the UK has not agreed a position.ldquoSo, now we are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. Itrsquos unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.ldquoWake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.Despite also facing pressure from pro-Europe Tories for a delay, the Prime Minister insisted in a press conference at the end of a summit of EU and Arab nations that she was sticking to her timetable.ldquoItrsquos within our grasp to leave with a deal on March  and thatrsquos where all of my energies are going to be focused, she said.Challenged over whether MPs would be able to voteon any additional assurances she secures from Brussels before they have been formally signed off by the EU, Mrs May told reporters:ldquoIt is possible to do it either way.Prime Minister Theresa Mayhad breakfast with German Chancellor Angela MerkelRejecting calls for a delay, the Prime Minister said: ldquoAn extension to Article , a delay in this process, doesnrsquot deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesnrsquot deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word lsquodelayrsquo says.ldquoAny extension of Article  isnrsquot addressing the issues.ldquoWe have it within our grasp.ldquoIrsquove had a real sense from the meetings Irsquove had here and the conversations Irsquove had in recent days that we can achieve that deal.Mr Tusk said it was ldquoabsolutely clear thatthere was no majority in the Commons to approve a deal, Britain faces ldquochaoticBrexitor extension.ldquoThe less time there is until March , the greater the likelihood of an extension, said Mr Tusk.ldquoThis is an objective fact. Not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact.ldquoI believe that, in the situation we are in, an extension would be a rational solution, but Prime Minister May still believes she is able to avoid this scenario.Theresa May held talks with Donald Tusk in Sharm El-Sheikh Mrs May said she had ldquogood meetings in Egypt with Mr Tusk, Mr Rutte, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish premier Leo Varadkar and Italyrsquos Giuseppe Conte.ldquoWhat I sense in all my conversations with my fellow leaders, both here in Sharm El-Sheikh and in recent days, is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal, she said.The meetings came after the PM admitted she will not get a Brexit deal in time for MPs to hold a ldquomeaningful vote this week.She said she will put her deal to Parliament by March  at the latest ndash  days before Britain is due to leave the EU.The PM faces the prospect of another potentially damaging Commons revolt on Wednesday, when MPs are expected to mount a fresh attempt to block a no-deal break and extend Article .A cross-party group of MPs immediately confirmed they will table an amendment giving the House the power to demand a delay to Brexitan agreement is not in place by March .In recent days three pro-EU Cabinet ministers ndash Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark ndash signalled they could be prepared to back the amendmentthere is no breakthrough in negotiations.There was speculation that up to  Tory MPs ndash including as many as  ministers ndash could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point.Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who drew up the amendment with Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, said it would become the ldquoreal meaningful vote on the Brexit deal.She told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe Government doesnrsquot feel to me to be behaving like a responsible government at all at the moment ndash the idea that we could be only a few weeks from Brexit and we still donrsquot know what kind of Brexit we are going to have and wersquore not even going to have a vote on it until two weeks before that final deadline.ldquoI donrsquot see how businesses can plan, I donrsquot see how public services can plan, and I think itrsquos just deeply damaging.Mrs May confirmed that Brexit negotiators willto Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with the EUrsquos Michel Barnier..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Three ministers urge Theresa May to take no-deal Brexit off table article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

vitamin d","story":"While there is a huge range of vitamins on the market for parents to choose from, the vast majority contain far less than the correct dose, experts said.Vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, a condition that affects bone development in children and which can lead tothe growth of soft, weak and deformed limbs.It is dficult to get enough vitamin D from diet, and the main source is sunshine.However, the weather in the UK means that there is limited exposure to sunlight from November to March.Public Health Englandrecommends that children aged one to four receive a daily  microgramvitamin D supplement.Those aged under one should be given a . to  microgram daily vitamin D supplement to ensure they get enough.In the new study, experts from the universities of Oxford and Southampton examined vitamins aimed at children sold by Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsburyrsquos, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett,Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug.In total,  multivitamin products made by  dferent manufacturers were included in the study.The daily vitamin D dose in the vitamins ranged from zero to IU.Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied IU per day ndash around half the recommended amount.For children under six months of age, only one multivitamin contained more than  IU day vitaminD, but this was only recommended from four months of age.For children over six months, just % to % of the available multivitamins provided the recommended IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.The researchers also looked at specic vitamin D products and vitamins marketed as being for healthy bones.Of the  products that were available, the range of vitamin D in them was from  to ,IU.Six products were suitable from birth, of which five contained  to IU per day ndash around the recommended amount.Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors concluded: ldquoThere is a wide range of both multivitamins and vitamin D supplementsavailable for children in the UK, yet most of these do notprovide the recommended  IU day.ldquoMultivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplementsor lsquohealthy bonesrsquo products, although some products labelled as lsquofor bonesrsquo contained very low levels of vitamin D.The team also looked at the Governmentrsquos Healthy Start scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide onlyIU per day of vitamin D.The research comes after data analysed by the Press Association showed there were , hospital admissions with a main or secondary diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in   ndash % more than the , in  .There were an additional  admissions in   where the main or secondary reason was rickets, up from the year before.Almost all these cases were young children, with  admissions for rickets in children aged nine and under, up from  the year before.A further  admissions for rickets were among those aged  to , up from  the year before.Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said:ldquoA normal healthy UK diet provides less than % of the recommended amount of vitamin D.ldquoThe natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure to sunlight in the UK so supplements are the only way to ensure UK children get the recommended dose.ldquoTo learn that so many products fail to provide children with the recommended level of Vitamin D is highly concerning, especially when latest evidence shows our childrenrsquos average intake are still below the recommended amount.ldquoThese products are misleading parents who think they are protecting their children from serious conditions such as rickets, poor growth and muscle weakness.ldquoI would advise all parents to check that the supplements they use contain the recommended  units of vitamin D and consult their pharmacistthey are unsure.He also said the Government should seriously consider fortying somefoods and milk with Vitamin D.Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the industry-funded health and food supplements information service , said: ldquoFood supplements are meant to supplement the diet, not replace the nutrients obtained from foods.ldquoIn that respect, and since there are ying recommendations across dferent age groups of children, it is right that dferent supplements offer dferent doses.ldquoSmaller doses allow parents to use the same product for younger and older children by ying the amount given.ldquoAccording to the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey data, children and adolescents are only getting a fth of the recommended vitamin D intake of  microgram from food alone.ldquoMany of the supplements in this survey would actually bridge the dietary gap topping up intake towards the recommended  microgramdaily..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Multivitamins aimed at children  udo not contain

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/light_12112.jpg","title":"belfast office building comes on to the market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew A major city centre office building with around , sq ft of space has gone on the market.
