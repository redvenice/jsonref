Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It says no one has been chosen for redundancy because of their whistleblowing or trade union activities.The company says those affected are in central London, where there has been a “significant downturn” in business and where cycle and walking couriers mainly work.The dispute escalated on Wednesday after IWGB members at the company voted to strike in protest at the redundancies and over safety issues in transporting medical samples, according to the union.TDL has more than 150 couriers, about half of whom are members of the IWGB. There have been previous disputes at the company in which a number of those now likely to lose their jobs were participants.In legal arguments submitted to the employment tribunal on behalf of the claimants, lawyers said: “The claimants all feel victimised for daring to take part in trade union activities and these decisions will have terrible consequences on their private and family lives.“Many of the claimants have children to support and wonder how they will be able to adequately support them if they are dismissed and unable to find a job.”TDS said in a statement: “It’s exceptionally disappointing that a minority of our couriers have voted to strike in the midst of this pandemic. The IWGB union, which represents TDL’s 157-strong courier workforce, balloted its 80 members, 46 of whom voted to strike, on a number of unfounded allegations relating to proposed redundancies and courier health and safety, which TDL does not recognise or accept.“Like many organisations across the country who are taking action to ensure their survival and future sustainability, TDL is making adjustments as a result of the pandemic, and is proposing to make its 10-person pushbike and walking courier fleet redundant.“This is due to a very significant downturn in the inner London postcodes in which they operate. Proposed redundancies are not a consideration ever made lightly, even in these exceptional circumstances. These proposals are currently subject to consultation with the 10 couriers and no decision has been made.”\u0026nbsp“We are working closely with our couriers and will continue to do so. We are absolutely committed to ensuring there will be no disruption to our normal service.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0062149e35b26e8215926f660eba390238740c/137_0_3227_1937/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=481fb41ccfaa037a9fccfca033ce1ff2","title":"tui cancels all foreign holidays until 1 july","story":"Tour operator further extends suspension of excursions due to Covid-19 travel restrictionsBritain’s biggest tour operator Tui has cancelled all its foreign holidays until 1 July, and some that were not due to depart until November.The company, which had previously hoped to resume package holiday excursions on 12 June, said it had extended the suspension of trips “due to the ongoing travel restrictions”.Tui holidays that were due to depart next month will not now be happening, it said. The company has also cancelled its lakes and mountain holidays up until 30 September, and its river cruises until 25 November.Many travellers have been hoping that travel operators would be up and running again by the autumn.A statement on the Tui website states: “Due to the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have advised against all but essential travel.“If your holiday falls into one of the below categories, we’re really sorry to say that it has been cancelled.”Back in March the government advised against all non-essential journeys, which stopped all foreign travel in its tracks.There has been no indication on when this restriction might be eased and home secretary Priti Patel announced last week that all travellers arriving in the UK, including UK residents, would face a mandatory 14-day quarantine from 8 June.The move has drawn substantial criticism from airlines. On Thursday the bosses of 70 travel firms wrote a joint letter to Patel calling on her to scrap the quarantine period, which they argue will halt future bookings.“The very last thing the travel industry needs is a mandatory quarantine imposed on all arriving passengers, which will deter foreign visitors from coming here, deter UK visitors from travelling abroad and, most likely, cause other countries to impose reciprocal quarantine requirements on British visitors,” it said.Last week the Competition and Markets Authority said it was investigating package holiday firms after receiving thousands of complaints from consumers who have been unable to recoup money on cancelled breaks.The UK Civil Aviation Authority is separately reviewing the way that airlines are treating their customers, and has warned them that it did not “expect airlines to systematically deny consumers their right to a refund”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e2796706c6d572fb80aba142bd163013eef44d0/0_109_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6af123d46255967990fde5c1d65d4e4","title":"us job losses unemployment coronavirus","story":"Rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall from its early-April peak but claimants still face huge delaysThe number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week.The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic.The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week.While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression.\u0026nbspEven months after shutdown orders were put in place, the reported unemployment figures may not show a complete picture of how many people were laid off due to the crisis.Many states are still trying to work through backlogs of thousands of applications as antiquated online systems struggle to keep up with the number of applicants. Oregon, for example, announced this week that it is still trying to process 38,000 unemployment claims. At the end of April, only a third of claims in Hawaii, a state that relies heavily on its tourism industry, had been processed.\u0026nbspAfter Jazz Salm was laid off from her job as a server at Chile’s, she immediately got onto Florida’s unemployment system to file her claim. It took her about a week to get through the system since the website kept crashing. When she was finally able to submit her claim, it took another month until she started receiving payments.During that month, Salm, who lives in Sarasota, had no idea what the status of her application was. Having just used her savings to move in February, Salm was left without money to pay her bills or even buy groceries until payments came in.“I think the government just needs to realize that we just want to be heard,” Salm said. “It all comes down to acknowledgement that us little people –\u0026nbspyou know, what are we supposed to do? We’re stuck.”Over the last few weeks, all 50 states have begun some type of reopening measures, bringing hope that the economy will revive as people start going back to work. But it is unclear what effect the measures have had on unemployment.\u0026nbspBut many businesses that have reopened are operating with far-from-normal procedures, like social distancing in dine-in restaurants and movie theaters, that mean foot traffic is still down compared with pre-shutdown times. Many local businesses have had to shutter permanently, probably leaving tens of thousands of Americans unemployed indefinitely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200f6fb45caeeeb890ce0963eebde00dcac0854b/0_76_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355272226a8f49b582c2865edf79a6a8","title":"coronavirus infection rate too high second wave","story":"Test and tracing is launching today but, as the lockdown eases, it will need to be massively stepped up to have a significant impactWe all now know the basics – the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to.\u0026nbspIf it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially.\u0026nbspIf it is less than 1.0 it will eventually disappear.\u0026nbspThere are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions and the “effective R” or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus.\u0026nbspWe calculate the R in several ways.\u0026nbspWhat it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths.\u0026nbspThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time but these take a week or two to process and report.\u0026nbspThus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers.The amount of virus each inidual\u0026nbspcarries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others – at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services – is important too.\u0026nbspThus, one man may have infected more than 90 clubgoers in South Korea, and one member of a choir in Washington State may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal.Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more.\u0026nbspThis is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0.\u0026nbspThe infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not drop precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.\u0026nbspThe epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards.\u0026nbspTo decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 – and no one thinks it has declined to that level.\u0026nbspAs Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: “A fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.”So where does this leave us over the next few months?\u0026nbspWith Re so close to 1.0 there are basically two options.\u0026nbspFirst, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people – bringing Re down further – so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China.\u0026nbspIt became clear from the prime minister’s announcement on 10 May on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus – guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus.\u0026nbspAs a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious.Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the “back to work and school” decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place.\u0026nbspIndoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly.\u0026nbspOn trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting.\u0026nbspAnd the use of face coverings should be the new normal – including at government press briefings.And travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions.\u0026nbspThere are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more gatherings and crowded trains, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to long-distance travel.Stabilising the epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine.\u0026nbspPerhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on.\u0026nbspBut when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is massively stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life. And all of this will guarantee more Covid-19 deaths in the UK.•\u0026nbspDavid Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3fa9b74dc62e4c72ea4bc30890b99c2546d806b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce059d7e9445243105e2874afcfe4c1","title":"dominic cummings democracy laws truth consequences","story":"Why should we keep faith with democracy when our leaders bend laws and distort truth?There is a moment in all British political scandals when a prickly sensation creeps up the spine: “He’s going to get away with it, isn’t he?” It isn’t provoked by Dominic Cummings alone. I felt the same watching Michael Gove’s exchange with Nick Ferrari on LBC: Gove first starting to claim that he too took the occasional miles-long drive to test his vision before rowing back, perhaps dazzled by the scale of the lie. Smirks were exchanged. The same when Matt Hancock stared down the camera on 30 April and celebrated “achieving” his testing target the reflux came two days ago, when revised testing figures revealed the target had, in fact, never been hit.It is not a sensation produced merely by lies, or the stench of hypocrisy in high places. It is the smirk, the assured belief that consequences are for little people, and that, in any case, anyone who really matters is in on the act. These people are open about it: to accept it is a mark of urbanity, to be disgusted by it is gauche.We have become used to being badly governed, and inured to lying. The prime minister’s laziness and mendacity are proverbial, but it is the mediocrity at the pinnacle of power that is more startling: the self-impressed dilettante and crank who whispers in his ear, or the toy-town thug - complete with pet tarantula - now in charge of the nation’s schools, or the conspiracy theorist “at war with cultural Marxism” now its most senior law officer, merrily dismissing the universality of law. The problem extends beyond politicians’ inidual deficiencies, severe though they are, and one might point to multiple sources of institutional rot to explain it, from the sycophancy of party bureaucracy to the evaporation of the civic bodies on which the great parties once drew. But there is also another, simpler explanation: politicians are increasingly insulated from the consequences of lying.The UK institutionalises its corruption, with peerages regularly doled out to party patrons. Even British politicians realise that allowing donors to purchase a permanent seat in the legislature looks bad so, formally at least, it is illegal.\u0026nbspDespite this, donors still acquire peerages\u0026nbspwith appalling regularity as this is a useful source of patronage, all the major parties simply look the other way.\u0026nbspBut this is emblematic of a wider institutional rot. Now Tory fundraisers, eyeing a Covid-19 collapse in cash, brief journalists that the party’s billionaire donors are cooling on Johnson for his failure to deliver them the peerages they expected. Such open entitlement ought to be a scandal itself, signalling a willingness to further dilute the UK’s already weak institutional safeguards instead it is greeted with jejune sophistication by commentators, proud to know that this is simply how the game works.Why are we so badly governed, to the point that we scarcely notice it? Stories of national decline are a cottage industry in Britain, and laments for a decaying polity are common in times of upheaval.\u0026nbsp“Where is now the soul of god-like Cato that durst be good” asked one stage character in the fag-end days of Elizabethan England, “when Caesar durst be evil?” That play itself – Ben Jonson’s\u0026nbsp1603 Sejanus\u0026nbsp– drew on Tacitus’s ancient laments about the corruption of imperial Rome, and landed its author a trial for treason. It is instructive not only because it reminds us that this anxiety is historically common, but because the villain’s fall sees him replaced only with another\u0026nbspvillain, equally violent and cruel.Like many conservative “declinists” since,\u0026nbspJonson’s Romans laid the blame for the weakening and corruption of the state on the decay of virtue among the citizenry.\u0026nbspModern culprits for decline might range as widely as the doctrine of equality or political correctness, or moral laxity, or the degradation of our capacity to think as independent citizens. Liberal variations impute more fault to institutions, concentrating on the corrupting influence of cash, our archaic forms of government, or erosion of sacrosanct political norms.Such permeating cynicism arises above all from depoliticisation: the claim, advanced over the past few decades, that ideological difference is dead, markets ought to be insulated from political contestation, and politics is merely a set of technical quibbles between administrators. Depoliticisation has produced a more professionalised politics with narrower routes of entry, and constrained what is agreed to be politically possible: thus the sad post-Thatcherite trawl of crumbling PFI schools, underfunded hospitals and outsourced public services. If the possibility of significant political change is denied, popular revulsion becomes increasingly anti-political, rejecting the legitimacy of democratic deliberation.That is why the Cummings scandal matters. His recurrent motif is that liberal democracy is a con: that deliberation and debate are simply excuses by elites to stifle the popular will all you should expect from politics is the occasional authorising vote for a champion you hope will wreck the joint in the way you prefer. The law, in turn, is for little people who can’t find a way round it, and protests about its universality are another elite sham.It might be that Cummings has overestimated public indifference, and the wave of popular anger washes him from office. But perhaps perversely, prime ministerial backing strengthens, rather than weakens, the cynicism on which he feeds. Had it not involved him, Cummings would have used this episode as a teaching moment.Democracies are more resilient than some expect. But they are still fragile achievements. If the link between actions and consequences in politics is severed, why should the young or disenfranchised keep faith with democracy at all? The pandemic has reminded us that we are not isolated iniduals, and our choices impact profoundly on others.Perhaps it also implies other unfashionable truths: politics matters. Laws should not have get-out clauses for the rich. State power is immense, rather than weak, and no one is entitled to it by rank or wealth. There are deceptions that should see you drummed out of public life altogether.\u0026nbspIf the tawdry spectacle of ministers bending the law and distorting the truth to defend an unelected aide teaches us anything, it’s this: consequences matter.•\u0026nbspJames Butler is co-founder of Novara Media and a regular contributor to the London Review of Books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc5f5f52e40c0ccc8481fb286c557d386603b17/0_359_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95daa8a1cd5c816bb3b00e229d343f70","title":"government help freelancers coronavirus theatre","story":"The self-employment income support scheme is due to end. This will be catastrophic for thousands of creative peopleI love theatre. I love the people, the community, the buzz. But the future of this industry is under threat – a pain felt most deeply by the people who make it a fabulous business. On 16 March, London’s West End closed its doors. Regional tours followed suit shortly afterwards, leaving actors, musicians, technical, wardrobe, wigs and front-of-house staff unemployed overnight. Performers and musicians couldn’t be furloughed because they’re technically self-employed, despite many of them being contracted well into 2021. Of course, that was OK because of chancellor Rishi Sunak’s self-employment income support scheme (SEISS). Or was it?Unfortunately, for the thousands of people employed in the theatre industry, there were so many gaps to fall through. The help for self-employed people only lasts until the end of May, while the furlough scheme extends until October. Show business is notoriously unpredictable there is no job security, so if you earned more than £50,000 in profits each year over the past three years but haven’t been able to find work since, you are not eligible for the grant.Imagine if you’d just landed yourself the role of a lifetime and moved to London to pursue your dream. Perhaps you took out a six- or 12-month lease on a property, knowing you were contracted for the duration of the tenure, despite not earning anywhere near this amount last year. The hundreds of graduates fresh out of training, many with massive student debt, who have been working in the industry since last summer are also not eligible for the scheme as they haven’t yet had the chance to file a tax return. And another group who won’t benefit, despite paying their taxes, are people who trade as limited liability companies.It’s not that these people don’t want to work, are shielding, or taking an extended break during the pandemic. It’s that there are no jobs in the industry they’re employed in. What we all hoped might happen – SEISS until May, ready for a triumphant reopening of the West End in June, with all regions following shortly afterwards – has turned out to not be so simple. What happens after the end of May, both for those lucky enough to have claimed SEISS, and for those who fell through the gaps?These are real people with mortgages, rent, bills, children, elderly relatives. We’ve all accepted that theatre will be one of the last industries to regain some semblance of “normality”, so why can’t the government accept that the people who have fallen through the gaps need ongoing help?Many members of the theatre industry applied for universal credit only to be told they did not qualify. Every supermarket around London now has its own ensemble cast of temporary staff consisting of the hardworking, versatile people of the theatre industry – but these jobs won’t be here forever. And not everyone is able to get a temporary job.\u0026nbspThe government must act now to preserve the arts and help the amazing network of people that make the industry as spectacular as it is.Better schemes are possible. The Spanish government recently announced it would be introducing a universal basic income. And in the Netherlands and France, theatre professionals can rely on an established social security system that ensures artists still get paid between jobs – coronavirus or no coronavirus. What if the next Elaine Paige or Michael Ball has just had their first professional job cut short by the pandemic, and is financially unable to continue in the industry? The lack of support for people working in this industry sends a signal the government thinks that such occupations are merely a paid hobby, that people can rely on savings, or get a “proper” job until they’re “fortunate” enough to pick up where they left off.When I was employed by British Airways, belonging to Unite the Union was a saving grace. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by coronavirus, unions have greater power to hold industries and government to account. I recently spoke to Paul Fleming, who is a candidate to be the general secretary of Equity, the trade union for creative practitioners, and is currently the central London theatres organiser. “Thanks to strong unions, our members have organised good agreements to put the industry on pause we’re ready to reopen when it’s safe and practical. But without guaranteed income for all our industry’s freelancers, a whole workforce is threatened with being washed away – the most under-represented artists first,” he told me.“With no unions on the government’s reopening task force, and just days to go until SEISS ends, the government risks telling artists and audiences that they don’t care about theatre’s economic and social importance.”As a whole, the arts and culture industry brings £10.8bn\u0026nbspto the economy every year – not to mention every pre- and post-theatre dinner, every quick glass of wine in a pub before a show, every train, plane and bus ticket, every hotel stay. The true contribution of theatreland to local economies is incalculable. For every £1 invested in the arts by the government, the industry returns £5. This is our hour of need. At a moment like this, we need the arts more than ever.• Amy Hart is a former cabin crew manager and a 2019 Love Island contestant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c83d7235f8b96f3be72feac2b3f9d15607eba3bf/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d0023825986b48aad6fef1c25343487","title":"postcard future life denmark after lockdown","story":"As the restrictions lift and we emerge blinking from our homes, it’s possible to believe that life will be good againUnder the shade of umbrellas, pensioners eat cake at a cafe, children slosh cups of juice, and students clink beer bottles, smoking, laughing and talking loudly enough to be heard above the buzz of people who are now … everywhere.On 18 May, the doors of cafes, restaurants and shops were flung wide in Denmark and the high streets are bustling again. Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes).There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in “lanes”, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time. But Danes are happy to comply for the most part – if there are already four people buying ice-cream, they’ll just come back later.Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to lock down on 11 March. The borders were closed two days later and Denmark’s famous hygge was put to the test as Danes were forced to stay home (although no restrictions were placed on outdoor exercise). As a rule-abiding bunch, Danes trusted that the government had their best interests at heart and so did as they were told. Every Saturday during lockdown, locals flew the Danish flag in solidarity and instead of clapping for health workers, Denmark’s answer to TV choirmaster Gareth Malone led Daily Morgensang (Daily Morning Song) on TV station DR1 to keep morale up. And it worked. Prime minister Mette Frederiksen’s hard and fast coronavirus strategy paid off – in a country of 5.8 million, the number of Covid-19 deaths stands at just 563 at time of writing and infection rates are low (0.7).Curve duly flattened, Denmark was the first country in Europe to reopen primary schools – as well as kindergartens and day-care institutions – in mid-April, following the advice that young children were the least at risk. Some were nervous at the idea of sending small children out to test the water, but after five weeks of supposedly “working from home” with three kindergarteners, I was tempted. With work Zoom calls regularly gatecrashed by Elsa from Frozen and bare bottoms (lockdown brought out the nudist in my kids), my husband and I decided to go for it. Socialising young children is considered crucial in Denmark and as one psychologist friend put it: “We like the idea that children are brought up not only by their parents but by a whole society, including teachers, school friends, grandparents etc. They learn different perspectives from different relationships.” He added: “I also like the idea that I’m not the only one responsible for their development and wellbeing.” Danes worked out quickly that social distancing was impossible with young children, who essentially lick everything they see. Instead, kids stay in “protective bubbles” – keeping to their own zones in the playground in small groups and sticking with the same teacher. Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and no parents are allowed inside the school. There are no face masks – for pupils or teachers lessons are outside whenever possible, and handwashing is hourly (eczema flare-ups abound). Teachers sport hand-sanitiser sprays like cowboys in a weird western and all equipment is disinfected several times a day.Denmark’s schools started off with a two-metre social distancing rule, but this has now been reduced to one metre and dropped entirely for kindergarteners. From 18 May, kids aged 11-plus returned to school, and they were also separated into smaller groups. This has been a logistical challenge but teachers have already seen the better teacherchild ratio as beneficial to behaviour – and kids polled say they’re glad to be back, following the isolation of home schooling.Many adults, by contrast, are content to still be working from home (without distractions). Denmark was already renowned for its work-life balance, but lockdown life has highlighted the importance of flexibility for employees. Some office workers are returning to their desks a few days a week, but there’s a sense that employers can no longer demand the same presenteeism or demanding commutes as before. Meeting face to face isn’t always necessary and shaking hands – previously a stalwart of Danish etiquette, done with everyone from your GP to your dentist and every member of a social gathering – is now a thing of the past.I can live without handshakes. What I miss are hugs, from friends. Socialising online made many of us strangely intimate. We didn’t know when we’d next see each other and so we opened up, skipping the small talk. Once we were officially allowed to socialise again in small groups, it was strange at first, tuning into friends in real life and talking about things other than coronavirus. But after the initial awkwardness, it was … brilliant (and blurry. Sore heads all around the next day). When restaurants and bars reopened, we emerged, blinking, from our homes, conscious of trying to keep up the meaningful connections that were somehow easier and more frequent when “normal life” wasn’t in the way.Danes have now been advised that they can see and even hug grandparents again, but for those with very elderly relatives or in at risk groups, the isolation continues. Hospitals are coping, but the threat of coronavirus means that anyone admitted is tested for Covid-19 as a matter of course and no visitors are allowed. I don’t know when I’ll see family in the UK since borders are still closed to foreign visitors (with some exceptions). But for the majority of those living Danishly, the silence of lockdown has been a time to re-evaluate – to notice things, good and bad, take stock, break habits and start over. Many are relearning the delights of the Danish countryside, of slowing down, of looking after each other. And now, in Denmark, there’s a mood of optimism best summed up by the slogan det bliver godt igen – or “it will be good again”.• Helen Russell is the bestselling author of The Year of Living Danishly.

The people deserve a more careful, evidence-based approach The United Kingdom went into the Covid-19 crisis as one nation. It seems likely to exit from the pandemic as several. At the outset, the UK’s different governments took similar approaches. Lockdown rules were observed by citizens in all parts of the country, with some infamous inidual exceptions like Dominic Cummings. As the onslaught starts to slacken, however, differential approaches are likely to become more important. These differences have now been embodied in the radically contrasted announcements made in London and in Edinburgh this week about the next stage.In England, the government has always been keener to lift the lockdown early. The case for this has never been easy to accept. The virus has not been a lighter scourge in England. The driving force has been a volatile mix of ideology and window dressing. Boris Johnson and his ministers have announced arbitrary goals – often under short-term pressure – and have then battled, generally unsuccessfully and at human cost, to meet them. The approach has never been comprehensive, well explained or effective. Among the most shocking examples have been shortages of personal protective equipment, testing failures for nursing homes and the refusal to test at ports and airports.This week’s virus tracing measures in England are the latest example of this shambolic approach. Mr Johnson said on 20 May that a “world beating” system to test and trace for coronavirus would be in place by 1 June. Easing the lockdown is umbilically linked to the need for such a system. Without it the dangers of a second wave of cases are very real. Yet it is now clear that the tracing system in England will be much more muddled, modest and incomplete than Mr Johnson claimed. A much trumpeted app does not yet exist. It will not be ready before late June. A slower, less efficient and more labour-intensive tracing system is now starting to come into operation, but there are numerous teething problems.Nevertheless the UK government is pushing ahead. Mr Johnson set the ball rolling in his botched broadcast on 10 May now, right on cue, he has managed to get scientific cover for the move from Sage, though other scientists have different views. He has also brought forward other measures from July to mid-June and been followed by the ever greedy Premier League. This is chaos waiting to happen. Mr Johnson’s eagerness is driven not just by his generally slapdash approach but also by his desperation to drown out the Cummings scandal. It seems all too likely that he will fail on both fronts, combining a mismanaged easing, which risks causing a spike in Covid-19 cases, with a stupid and damaging attempt to keep Mr Cummings in post.Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon’s government has proceeded in an altogether more cautious, logical and planned manner. Mark Drakeford in Wales and Arlene Foster in Northern Ireland have done the same, but Scotland’s first minister has now committed to some easing from the end of this week. Many of these measures have been permitted in England for nearly three weeks, but Ms Sturgeon’s message remains a more careful one and she has done nothing to encourage reckless headlines of the kind that Mr Johnson ignited so stupidly earlier in May. Travelling more than six miles in Scotland to take exercise will remain discouraged, for example. In England, one can travel 260 miles or more.Scotland’s approach is far closer to public opinion in all parts of the UK, England included. One of the great lessons of the pandemic has been that governments that trust their publics, level with them, and prepare and explain their next moves properly, are the ones that enjoy public confidence for their handling. Ms Sturgeon, Mr Drakeford and Ms Foster continue to do that. Mr Johnson, as this week has underscored, sometimes seems to barely care. The people of England deserve so much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f6b854f7f0c299f866047a41128cbca01b2387/472_320_3789_2273/master/3789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2b0818d85b0da651db630634c5fde1d","title":"the world wasnt ready for a green new deal in 2009 today it may be","story":"There is no easy route to a greener global economy. But since coronavirus hit, politics and business are thinking againTiming matters. Early 2020 saw an economic collapse the likes of which have not been seen in living memory. Growth has collapsed, unemployment has soared, poverty has increased.Yet in different circumstances the past few months would have been dominated by calls for countries to do more to cut carbon emissions. As 2019 drew to an end, everybody from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund\u0026nbspto the governor of the Bank of England was warning of the threat of global heating.A year of floods, hurricanes and bush fires had made a strong case for action to make economies more sustainable. What was lacking was a profound shock that would make change possible. Now we’ve had one.Governments are creating, borrowing and spending money like never before in peacetime, in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have the opportunity to reshape their economies in a way that would be consistent with preventing catastrophic increases in global temperatures. Businesses are already learning lessons from the lockdown, such as that modern technology no longer makes it essential for an executive to travel half way round the world for a business meeting, and that employees can be just as productive working from home as they can when sat in expensive set-piece city centre offices.The world has been here before, though, and there is no guarantee that an opportunity proffered will be an opportunity taken. One was certainly missed at the back end of the 2000s, when the banks nearly went bust. Supporters of a Green New Deal\u0026nbsp(of whom I was one) said governments should avert the possibility of a second Great Depression by investing in decarbonisation of their economies and programmes that would put people back to work by making their homes energy-efficient.Things look a bit different this time. The UK economy shrank by as much in March – when there was barely more than a week of lockdown – as it did in the whole of the 2008-9 recession. April’s number will be a lot worse, and recovery is going to be slow, even assuming there is no second wave of infections.During the financial crisis, the then Labour government took a stake in two of Britain’s high-street banks. This time, a Conservative government has effectively nationalised the railways, announced plans to support strategically important companies, and is paying the wages of more than 10 million workers.What’s more, it has been a case of money is no object. The UK is on course to borrow £300bn this year at dirt cheap interest rates. The Bank of England is creating money through its quantitative easing programme. The argument that a Green New Deal is unaffordable is still knocking around, but is much less powerful than it was a decade ago. Ministers can decide whether they want to do more than respond to the immediate crisis and they certainly have the power to shape the recovery by making demands of the companies they are supporting, if they choose to use it.Here the picture is mixed. Governments make all the right noises about sustainability, yet many of them have used the crisis as an excuse for relaxing or suspending environmental regulations in order to stimulate activity of any sort. Those who think action of global heating should be a matter for markets not governments see Covid-19 as an opportunity too.But only up to a point. For some, lockdown has provided a glimpse of what a sustainable economy might look like. For others – those who face losing their jobs in carbon-intensive sectors – that sort of future doesn’t look so attractive.Politics reflects this tension. If parties of the left sometimes seem less enthusiastic about a GND than they might be, it is because a lot of the people who vote for them like the idea of cheap flights and rely on their old banger to pay visits to their mum. No question, any transition to a greener, more sustainable economy will have to overcome not just active opposition but passive resistance from those who would like life to return to its pre-Covid-19 crisis state.One solution might be to trial in one of the UK’s big cities – Manchester or Glasgow, say – to see whether a GND creates jobs, cuts emissions and generates a new wave of profitable environmental innovation. Opponents of change don’t need to do anything they simply need to wait for inertia to kick in. Those who want a different sort of economy need to start somewhere. And they should start with a simple question: if not now, when?• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbcac3b6c6a50ac88d5c22f4a798279615911b9/453_589_3497_2099/master/3497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc017bfe7ffe4c96742260ff4062ff8","title":"share your photos of butterflies in the uk","story":"We want to see your photos of butterflies you have spotted around the country during the sunny weather Due to a combination of warmth and sunshine across the UK, butterflies have been spotted enjoying the good weather.If you have seen any near you, we’d like to see your photos.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

From Normal People to Angela Rayner, DIY bangs are the new normalAs our contact with the outside world shrinks to the size of a screen, once-private things have been pushed to the fore.Our bookshelves, formerly unseen by our co-workers, have become pregnant with meaning. Our tired faces, once optimised for the workplace with concealer and a fancy neckline, are beginning to crack after one too many Zoom meetings. For those of us working from home, headshots are the new hemlines.Then there is our hair: our rubbish, 10-week too-long hair that we can’t really improve without breaking the law – or at least a headband (although according to the Freelance Association of Hairdressers, clients are trying, “offering thousands of pounds” for an illicit trim). There has recently been further uproar over Dominic Raab’s plans to not open salons until July.Like so many successful things in 2020, the lockdown fringe began on social media and, also like so many things, was consolidated in Britain by the TV adaptation of Normal People. Connell’s silver chain might have spawned its own social media account and be “comparable to what James Dean did for the simple white T-shirt” (according to its costume designer), but so, too, has Marianne’s evolving fringe, which came with its own story arc – choppy when young, flourishing during her sexual prime, and so on – and now its own Instagram account, @Mariannesbangs, with 5,000 followers and counting. Earlier this month, Vanity Fair even published an essay in homage, called Fringe Watch. Sandra Kelly, the show’s hair designer, describes the online reaction to Marianne’s bangs as “Fringemania”.Still, a sharp, face-framing fringe on Zoom has become yet another impossible beauty standard to add to the list, and one that reflects self-improvement over pandemic restriction. While Bella Hadid cut hers in lockdown to match Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday with surprising deftness, and Anna Wintour seems to have a live-in hairdresser, it appears deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has chosen not to touch hers in her last television appearance on The Andrew Marr show, she had swept it artfully to one side.If hair has become a talking point of lockdown – and further proof that personal grooming is key to our welfare regardless of what is happening in the outside world (the re-opening of beauty salons in Italy this month allegedly outranked restaurants and shops in demand) – then DIY fringe cuts are a distillation of this new normal. Lengths vary, but the sentiment remains – a good fringe is proof that the wheels of professionalism are working nicely, even if they are coming off.We’re now 10 weeks into lockdown and well past the sweet spot of a recommended trim – “which is absolutely six to eight weeks”, according to Northwood, the man who coined and cultivated The Alexa (Chung) and The Claudia (Winkelman). As for the fringe, “it generally has a four-week shelf life. So if you went into lockdown with one, chances are you will have given yourself one trim already”. Northwood has been guiding clients such as Winkelman into cutting hers at home, using clips, point cutting and texturising scissors, videos of which have been uploaded on to social media. He says most of his work right now is on YouTube.“Cutting your hair now is mostly born out of necessity, and yes definitely a way to feel like you are in control, that you are not losing yourself,” says Rachael Gibson, a hair historian. To many people, the thought of going to a hair salon represents a return to normality after a long, destabilising period – in lieu of this, cutting our hair is as close as we can get.In these screen-focused times, and with mask-wearing soon possibly to be mandatory, could we be on the cusp of a Fringe Index?The pandemic has plunged us into deep uncertainty. The twist, says Northwood, is that people are also after fringes when salons re-open in July. “It seems that cutting your hair is one thing, but focusing on the fringe is more like a mood change, something that marks a new beginning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a1225571737f03dda29472decb3761bf564b64c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=661e54e6f59da89648b5df8147c9af43","title":"nottingham forest retained european cup 40 years ago","story":"Brian Clough’s team went to the 1980 final without their record signing. They returned as two-time European championsBy Steven Pye for That 1980s Sports Blog“You win something once and people say it is all down to luck,” reflected Brian Clough after Nottingham Forest had successfully defended the European Cup on 28 May 1980. “You win it twice and it shuts the buggers up.”Winning the 1979 European Cup was hardly a fluke. Defeating Liverpool and Cologne on their way to the final in Munich, Nottingham Forest could not be accused of having things easy. Admittedly, Malmo were not the most testing of opponents in the final. But a year on, Forest’s opponents in the final at the Bernabéu could not be dismissed so lightly.Hamburg had cruised past Icelandic team Valur before defeating Liverpool’s conquerors Dinamo Tbilisi in the second round. An away-goals win over Hajduk Split in the last eight set up a semi-final clash with Real Madrid. Overturning a 2-0 first leg deficit with a 5-1 win at the Volksparkstadion, Hamburg’s attacking threat was clear for all to see.Inevitably the British media focused on Kevin Keegan and his part in the final, as he looked to bid a similar farewell to Hamburg as he had done with Liverpool three years before. But Hamburg were dealt a couple of major blows three days before the final. A defeat to Bayer Leverkusen ended their hopes of retaining the Bundesliga and, to make matters worse, striker Horst Hrubesch – their top scorer in the league and European Cup that season – suffered an ankle ligament injury.Forest had their own problems. Trevor Francis ruptured an achilles tendon in a league game against Crystal Palace a few weeks before the final. “Of course, we will miss Trevor Francis,” said Clough. “At the time of his injury the lad was going like a bomb.” Francis’s recent form had been a revelation, his goals against Dynamo Berlin and Ajax crucial in helping Forest reach the final. Nevertheless, Clough left Francis devastated when he told him not to attend the final. “The only message I had from the manager came through Brian’s secretary” said Francis later. “She rang me a few days before the final to say that the manager doesn’t want you to be at the final. I was hurt, really hurt.” For such a great man manager, it seemed a rare blemish.However, Clough had his hands full with another issue at the time. After he was not selected to play in John Robertson’s testimonial, Stan Bowles walked out of the club and missed their mini-break to Majorca before the final. In doing so, he had ruled himself out of a potential European Cup final appearance. There was no doubt he would have featured at some point.In the end, Forest travelled to Madrid with just a 15-man squad and could not even fill the allocated five spaces on the substitutes’ bench. Former Sunderland goalkeeper Jim Montgomery sat alongside John O’Hare, Bryn Gunn and David Needham. The very definition of being down to the bare bones.The task of filling Francis’ boots fell to 18-year-old Gary Mills. “It is beyond my wildest dreams,” said Mills, who started the game up front in support of Garry Birtles before dropping back into midfield, leaving Birtles to run himself into the ground. Forest had no option other than to spread five across midfield. With Francis out, assistant manager Peter Taylor admitted they would have to change their game plan drastically. “If you’re a betting man get your money on us to win 1-0,” Taylor said, hinting that Forest would hardly be at their most expansive. It would be a case of the ends justifying the means.For Peter Shilton, the match in Madrid would be a triumph, but there were rumours he would would miss the final. The goalkeeper took a painkilling injection in his shoulder and made it on to the field. Montgomery had performed heroics for Sunderland in the FA Cup final in 1973, but the prospect of the 36-year-old winning the European Cup on his Forest debut may even have been a stretch for Clough’s scriptwriter.A save from a Felix Magath free-kick early on set the tone for Shilton’s evening, his levels of concentration soaring through the roof as Hamburg probed all night. His point-blank block from Jürgen Milewski was especially impressive given he had trained twice on a roundabout before the final due to a lack of suitable facilities.Before the match, there had been a lot of hype about West German international Manny Kaltz, an attacking full-back renowned for his bananenflanken (banana crosses). Clough was unperturbed though. “We’ve got a little fat guy that will turn him inside out –\u0026nbspa very talented, highly skilled, unbelievable outside-left,” said the Forest manager, his sly smile almost suggesting he knew that John Robertson was destined to score the winner.In the 20th minute, Robertson collected the ball on the left before cutting inside and away from Kaltz. After playing a one-two with Birtles, who assisted while laying on the ground, Robertson took the ball away from Keegan and fired home from the edge of the box.The goal gave Forest something to hold on to, setting up the game as a backs-against-the-wall assignment. Centre-backs Larry Lloyd and Kenny Burns were superb. Lloyd, who passed a late fitness test on his ankle, had warned his old mate Keegan that his defensive partner Burns was after him. Burns’ tackle on Keegan that earned him a yellow card in the first half certainly confirmed his intentions.A lot has been made of that tackle by Burns and whether Keegan dropped deeper and deeper as the match progressed to escape the attentions of the Scottish centre-back. The introduction of a half-fit Hrubesch at half time possibly had more to do with this, yet the fact that Forest kept Keegan quiet was a telling factor on the night.Shilton continued to thwart Hamburg, a fine save from Peter Nogly in the second half another for the highlights package. Hamburg finally got a shot past him on the hour mark, but Kaltz’s drive came back off the post. Ivan Buljan nearly scored from a few yards out after a scramble in the box but his shot trickled wide. Forest were just about managing to hold back the tide.Naturally, fatigue kicked in. A limping Frank Gray was replaced by Gunn O’Hare came on for Mills and Birtles was so tired that he failed to get a shot off when put through on goal late on. But as the seconds ticked down, the worst fears of the Germans were coming true. It was a draining night for everyone involved. Even the ITV commentator Brian Moore lost his bearings, announcing to 13 million viewers at the final whistle that Hamburg were European champions. Despite Moore’s momentary slip, the trophy was staying in England for a fourth successive year.Real Madrid, Benfica, Inter, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Liverpool had all defended the European Cup successfully in the past. Now, amazingly, the name of Nottingham Forest could be added to that list.In the immediate aftermath of the glory, Clough and Taylor found themselves defending Forest’s approach to the match. The Observer’s Hugh McIlvanney asked: “Was it much of a thrill for anyone outside the impressive numbers of Nottingham supporters?” One foreign commentator even suggested Forest had “taken the soul out of this European final.” It may not have been thrilling or entertaining but, given the circumstances, surely Forest’s tactics were understandable. “We gave Hamburg a lesson in application, determination and pride,” said Clough defiantly. “Defending well is just as important as attacking well. We weren’t lucky, we were good.”Clough turned his attentions to the future after the game, announcing that the club intended to build upon their success. But nothing lasts forever. A defeat by CSKA Sofia the following season ended Forest’s hold on the European Cup and the cracks in the Clough-Taylor partnership slowly began to open. Gradually the team broke up and, sadly, the replacements brought in were not of the same quality.Madrid turned out to be the end of an era. But what a glorious era it was. A time when Clough and Taylor performed miracles in leading Nottingham Forest to two European Cups. It may not be the greatest achievement in European football, but it’s in the top one.•\u0026nbspThis article appeared first on\u0026nbspThat 1980s Sports Blog•\u0026nbspFollow\u0026nbspSteven Pye on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a79babf6e87c9c7a7cfaf5825cf6791ef86de2d/0_30_2384_1431/master/2384.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f3cb671ab134660e2c6e8ec2709062f1","title":"start slow wear what you like watch out for zombies a beginners guide to running","story":"There’s a replacement to your pre-lockdown workout right outside your door.

But do resist the urge to just whack on the pair of throwback Nikes you bought for fashion purposes last year.“For people who are starting out, it’s important not to get bogged down in the kit, and actually think about the action of running,” says Anna Harding, the host of YouTube’s the Running Channel. “But I would suggest investing in a new pair of specific running trainers, and, for women, a sports bra. You don’t know the state of your old shoes, and it’s important to take care of your feet and knees. Other than that, though, wear what you feel good in.”When you first hit the road, you need to run slowly. Really slowly. So slowly you feel silly because of how slowly you are running. Slow enough that you’re pretty sure you could overtake yourself at a brisk walk.The point of running is endurance, and the most important thing to do is to make sure that you keep your heart rate elevated for the entire period of every training run. That means, especially at the beginning, erring on the side of caution: if you run slowly and find yourself barely breaking a sweat 20 minutes in, then you can speed up, but if you go too fast at the start, those last five minutes are going to be tough.“Start slow” also applies to how you should build up stamina over the first few weeks and months of your run. Thankfully, there is a best-in-class option here: the Couch to 5k programme, originally created by Josh Clark, an American software designer, in 1996. The idea is simple: run three times a week for eight weeks, beginning with sessions that involve more walking than actual running, and ending with 30 minutes of non-stop jogging.Your first session sees you running for a minute then walking for 90 seconds, and repeating the pattern eight times – enough to get an elevated heart rate for 20 minutes, and to get a solid eight minutes of actual running in. Four weeks later, the running has increased to three sets of five minutes, separated by three minutes of walking. And at the end of week five, the training wheels come off, and you run for a full 20 minutes non-stop.When I first tried to become a runner, in 2009, I would manually create those routines, booting up GarageBand on an old laptop and recording myself saying “run” and “walk” over the top of whatever I wanted to listen to, then loading it on to an iPod Shuffle. No wonder I didn’t stick with it. These days, it’s easier: the NHS has produced a podcast and app that automatically coaches you through the first nine weeks of your run.Some people think I’m daft for running to podcasts, wondering how on earth I can get into a good rhythm while catching up on Today in Focus. Sometimes, I think they’re nuts for running to music: no matter how good a tune is, it’s not distracting enough to save me from getting a bit bored 20 minutes in.If you want something more active still, you could try Zombies, Run! The app, which first launched eight years ago, lets you play through audio adventures timed to encourage and motivate you throughout a workout. A stand-alone couch-to-5k version can accompany you right from the start.“I started running when I was 20 or 21, and when we started Zombies, Run!, I was 28 or 29. Now I’m 37,” says Adrian Hon, the app’s co-creator. “I was a runner at that point, but I intensely remember the experience of not being a good runner. It came to me hard.”No one cares how sweaty you are, whether the top you run in is too bright or how fast or slow you’re going. So don’t worry about it. “A lot of the advertising, marketing and branding around running is incredibly unhelpful,” Hon says, “because it makes people think that a runner is some athletic supercharged person in Nike gear who doesn’t sweat. People get really self-conscious about that, and they get embarrassed. But no one gives a shit. Really: no one gives a shit what you look like.”Pavement space is at a bit of a premium right now, and in some places, that has led to hard feelings between runners, walkers and cyclists – not to mention the drivers who still get the majority of the road.“It has certainly become more of an obstacle course as we try to maintain the two-metre distance,” Harding says. “And I think as runners we are getting a little bit of side-eye from pedestrians, perhaps because of some reports suggesting that runners aren’t adhering to physical distancing.”It isn’t all negative, says Hon. “Obviously, there are more people running. Which is nice in some ways – you feel like you’ve got company. But it’s also tricky you’re having to weave in between people.“It’s a bit of a game: how do I maintain physical distancing while running? But there’s a happy medium, and there can occasionally just be too many people trying to share one fairly thin pavement. You’ve got to be very forgiving. It’s hard – sometimes I get annoyed when people run close to me. But risk is, I think, not as high as many other activities.”There are an awful lot of services that will track your stats, engage in virtual races or let you join a global community of runners. But before you jump in, remember why you’re running. It’s probably not to be the fastest among your friends, and if you’re not careful, such features can be more dispiriting than motivating.“People react to this stuff differently. In general, it is quite motivating to see yourself get faster, and to see yourself run further,” says Hon. “But when you have this social-media stuff … I think people are just too different. It becomes hard for it to be interesting or useful. Some people may like it, but the problem is that for most people, unless all their friends are runners, their range of abilities are all over the place.”Harding agrees: “The first thing to overcome is pride. For a lot of people, they’ll either compare themselves with where they used to be or to their friends who are running, or have been running a while.”“Motivation is something that will hit you during your early stages of running,” Harding says, “and continue to hit you after your running journey. And so that first day of ‘I really don’t fancy it today’ is one to overcome. But to steal a slogan from a well-known brand … just do it. You will genuinely feel better. I have never gone for a run and regretted it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25273b6341cfb9e538ae6f0d6ee78737016b41ec/0_344_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23053d736e73513a3a09d40fe490c6ba","title":"walk this way how to optimise your stride and focus your mind to get the most from your daily stroll","story":"Lockdown has reminded us of the pleasures of walking. But making small changes can boost its benefits to our health, mood and creativity, tooAs a form of physical activity, it is easy to dismiss walking as, well, pedestrian. But now its benefits, both physical and mental, are being appreciated once again. Under lockdown, daily walks became sacred. Now they are the safest way to commute, and, for those stuck at home, there is little place else to go other than to wander the streets, forests, towpaths, cemeteries and eerily deserted business quarters.We have become nosy tourists in our own neighbourhoods. We seek out less-travelled backwaters, eyeing curiously the fragments of human and animal lives that we pass, gazing on seasonal changes like besotted new parents. But are we walking to the best of our abilities? Possibly not. Sports scientist Joanna Hall has dedicated her career to coaching people in how to walk the way their bodies were designed to, which no longer comes easily in this sedentary, screen-based era.“I approach this as you would do if you wanted to get better at tennis,” she says. She developed her Walk Active programme to enable people to ease their aches and pains as they exercise, rather than exacerbate them. Lifestyle, ageing and injuries mean that when we put one foot in front of the other, the way we use our muscles may be, she says, “suboptimal for improving our posture, or reducing joint strain and getting the most out of walking”.According to Hall, there are four common aspects we get wrong, and each has knock-on effects on the body. Firstly, instead of propelling ourselves forwards by pushing off with the back foot, like an ice-skater, we try to use our stepping foot to power us along. This is because sitting down too much has made our hip flexor muscles short and tight. Hall describes the necessary adjustment as the subtle difference between stepping into a space (wrong) and pushing off from a space, which will recruit the right muscles up the backs of your legs. “You use your glutes and you open up the core,” says Hall.The second problem is what Hall calls a passive foot strike. The movement provided by the joints in our feet offers suspension and balance but we often plod along flatly instead, leaving us compromised. “That’s what causes knee discomfort,” says Hall. “It can create slight misalignment of the back, stiffness of the shoulders.”The third thing to watch out for is letting your head hang forwards. Screens, reading and desk work have made this the default position, which is a bit of a disaster. “When the head is slightly forward,” says Hall, “the muscles of the upper back and the shoulders have to contract to hold it there. The shoulders come forward and can stiffen. Back mobility becomes restricted and you will not be able to rotate your spine from the hips.” Try lifting your head before looking over your shoulder and you may discover, as I did, that you can turn your head much further all of a sudden.Finally, our arms tend to hang awkwardly or we force them into tense, power-walk movements, when what they want is to dangle freely. If you get steps one to three right, this should happen naturally. Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter more gazelle than galumph.Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a 2012 study by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug.Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting.So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, “go think about ideas beforehand while walking.” Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive.If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk – perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining – she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a “deep e”, she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas.She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren’t flowing, don’t force it. Come back to it another time.Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, “because the idea of writing something down is already a filter – is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone.” And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you’re having a phone conversation.As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in treating depression. Hugh O’Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls “natural meds”, and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. “You have different locations and different routes,” says O’Donovan. “You can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn’t really matter. It’s just the fact that you’re doing it.”To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests “experimenting with noticing how you’re feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?” However you prefer to walk, he invites you to “come to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we’re on autopilot. We’re unconscious, unaware of what’s going on around us. There’s magic all around us all the time but we’re too busy.” Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. “What are you seeing, smelling, tasting?” he asks. “The world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.”While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you’re struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O’Donovan, “the error and bias that’s associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively.” How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, “why me?” or “why this?” Ask instead, says O’Donovan, “what now?” Walking can help with this. “The world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don’t fall into the hole.“Your best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what’s going on in the world,” he continues. “It might seem like it’s very dark at the moment, but there’s lots of good stuff going on too. Focus on what kind of a story you choose to tell. And, by getting out, moving and keeping your energy up, you have the possibility of telling a more positive story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5907b4dbbf77ceee55e58958f38575584287ba48/1164_1063_3388_2033/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=995bc22d8609f3df2589f3b3a247f144","title":"zoom shabbat unexpected joy","story":"Shabbat for me used to mean a break from screens, but as I drop into synagogues all over North America, I’m reminded we’re all in this together Before the pandemic, Shabbat for me meant a break from screens. My synagogue, housed in a century-old building on a residential street in a quiet Toronto neighbourhood, observes the ancient laws that prohibit the use of technology on the Sabbath. A few Saturdays a month, I used to dress up, walk to shul (synagogue), and leave the frenetic demands of the secular, wired world behind. Since the pandemic shut the doors to my synagogue, I reluctantly turned to online shul to fill the void. Shabbat by Zoom, it turns out, is unexpectedly nourishing. Last month, the leaders of the conservative movement of Judaism gave rabbis the green light to livestream on Shabbat. Thousands of Jews around the world are just now discovering the joy of virtual worship, known to more liberal Jews for years. In fact, Zoom Shabbat has some distinct advantages over in-real-life congregation. If a sermon is boring, I’ll hop over to a different one. If I don’t like the voice of one cantor, I’ll close the tab and find another. Attendance is anonymous. No one notices if you show up late or leave early. I’ve dropped into synagogues all over North America.Virtual shul helps me mark the passing of time. Because I no longer drop my kids off to school or ride the subway to work, the days tend blend into each other. Virtual shul helps make Shabbat morning feel special. On Saturdays, we sleep in. My husband works on a cryptic crossword. Mid-morning, I recite Shabbat prayers with other people, just like before the pandemic, only now I don’t dress up or leave the house. I open my laptop at my kitchen table in my yoga pants, or sometimes in bed. My seven-year-old daughter colours beside me, and the two of us sing along to familiar melodies.Something else I like about livestream shul: it can be more intimate than in real life. You’re invited inside the private living rooms and offices of clergy where you can see their art, bookshelves and furniture. When the cantor Julia Cadrain, from Central Synagogue on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, sings from her apartment with a guitar on her lap in front of a wall of hanging plants, I feel like her personal guest. Sometimes her toddler joins her.I avoid the congregations that require Zoom password, which can lead to awkward situations. On a recent Saturday morning, I logged into a service held by Romemu, a progressive congregation on the Upper West Side, and in one of the little Zoom boxes, I saw the face of an old high school friend I hadn’t seen for over 20 years. I wondered if he’d seen me, if my hair looked OK, if I should follow up with an email. Flummoxed, I quickly logged off.If I’m lucky, I’ll stumble upon the bar or bat mitzvah of a stranger. Bar or bat mitzvahs are my preferred genre of reality television in the age of Covid-19. Inevitably, I cry from start to finish. I admire how, in the face of a disappointment, the kid, wearing fancy clothes, in the company of just immediate family, with a scroll placed on a dining room table, found a way to create a meaningful ritual. If she can do that, I think, maybe I can survive this, too. Sometimes the faces of the grandparents are Zoomed in from Florida, their knickknacks proudly displayed on shelves behind them. Captured on the screen is the sadness of the pandemic, the forced separation of grandparents from their grandkids, but it’s also an act of hope: despite the circumstances, the Jewish tradition is being passed from one generation to the next.When this is over, will I go back to attending synagogue in real life, or will my new virtual habit satisfy my needs? I’m not sure. Thousands of years ago, when Judaism shifted from being a temple-based religion to a bunch of communities spread out across the diaspora, synagogue ritual was invented as a kind of placeholder, until the temple in Jerusalem can be rebuilt. What we’re witnessing now is another great adaptation.I still miss my old synagogue. I miss the sound of voices singing together in spontaneous harmony. I miss the drama of the wrapped-up Torah scroll processing up and down the aisle and I miss the warm, wood-walled room that holds many happy memories. But Zoom Shabbat will do until the real thing comes back. Shabbat gives the week a rhythm. There’s a crescendo leading to Shabbat and a bittersweet denouement when it’s over. Without it, I’d be lost. Even though we can’t congregate, even though we can’t meet, Zoom shul reminds me that we’re all in this together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3305b6524f9cbb7232423dd361344b478390872/0_0_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f51c3e44df093e26fa6cc9117d22aeb","title":"bbc switches emily maitlis in newsnight episode over cummings remarks","story":"Katie Razzall stepped in after BBC reprimanded host over ‘breach of impartiality rules’Emily Maitlis was replaced as host of Wednesday night’s episode of Newsnight by another member of the programme’s team after BBC bosses reprimanded her over a monologue in which she attacked the government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.News bosses at the corporation said the BBC2 programme’s lead presenter breached impartiality rules with her opening remarks on Tuesday night. She had been due to host the show on Wednesday night, but the Newsnight reporter Katie Razzall presented it instead.Maitlis later tweeted she had “asked for the night off”.Amid growing criticism of the reprimand, Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, wrote on Twitter that Maitlis “hasn’t been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement”.In the monologue Maitlis told viewers: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.“The longer ministers and the prime minister insist he worked within them, the more likely the angry response to the scandal is likely to be … He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can flout them.”Talking of Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement: “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it.”Maitlis finished the programme by telling viewers: “I’ll be back tomorrow.” Clips of the sequence went viral on social media, attracting millions of views – many more than tune in to Newsnight on a typical evening. However, it caused fury among both Conservative politicians who have largely parked their longstanding criticism of the BBC during the pandemic, and also some journalists in and outside the public broadcaster who felt it went against the corporation’s approach to journalism.BBC news bosses agreed with the criticism of its own show, swiftly issuing a statement distancing themselves from the monologue. BBC sources said Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night’s episode.“The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,” the corporation said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.”Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said:\u0026nbsp“This statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses.\u0026nbspNewsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for\u0026nbsptheir serious investigative work on Cummings, that’s not something you could say about\u0026nbspthe BBC News at 10.\u0026nbsp“Pandering to\u0026nbsp10 Downing Street\u0026nbspby curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.”\u0026nbspAn SNP spokesperson added: “It’s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.”\u0026nbspMaitlis’s profile, already high, has risen further since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter. She received global acclaim after confronting Prince Andrew about his connections with the deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In April she had a viral hit with another monologue of hers dismissing the idea that coronavirus is a “great leveller” given its disproportionate impact on poorer people .The BBC has faced heavy criticism over the issue of maintaining impartiality in its news coverage, particularly over its handling of complaints about comments that BBC Breakfast’s presenter Naga Munchetty made about Donald Trump. It also struggled to deal with the enormous levels of criticism from both Labour and the Conservatives during the 2019 general election.• This article was amended on 27 and 28 May 2020.

She later responded to people sending messages of support: “Been overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages – and support on here – and I’ve probably missed much of it.

The issuing agent was Travel Trolley. Like thousands of others, we have been impacted by the coronavirus travel ban when my flights were cancelled. Travel Trolley has offered a credit note for the full amount and when I requested a refund it demanded a £75 admin fee to pass on the money already repaid by the airline! It can’t be legal to hold me to ransom like this.SB, LondonOther readers have written in with the same complaint. Travel Trolley, owned by multi-millionaire tycoon Kuljinder Bahia has insisted all passengers pay £75 if they want a cash refund rather than a credit note, despite the fact that its terms and conditions only mention the charge if a passenger, rather than the airline, cancels a flight. Skyscanner has publicly condemned the policy. “We’ve been supporting travellers who contact us and have been working closely with providers to try and ensure that any admin fees for refunds are reasonable,” it says. “We’ve seen success in some partners changing their policies as a result, and will continue discussions with providers to ensure travellers are being treated fairly. We’re asking Travel Trolley to treat cases from Skyscanner referrals as priority.”Travel Trolley failed to respond to requests for a comment. The trade association, ABTA, of which Travel Trolley is a member, says: “Travel agents may charge an admin fee to cover the cost of the work they have done in relation to a cancelled booking. However, these fees must be reasonable and clearly set out in their terms and conditions. If they have not reserved the right to do so, they should not charge a fee.”It referred the company to its legal team after the Observer alerted it.

It will start at 11.30am rather than 2.30pm to debate a government motion on how to proceed.In a letter to MPs the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said he had agreed to the government plan: “Now that I have agreed to a recall on Tuesday, it is for the government to decide what proposal for voting it wishes to put forward.“I have been clear to the government and to opposition parties that I would prefer cross-party agreement to be reached about the way in which the house should conduct its proceedings when the house returns, including on how isions should take place.”Hoyle said the PHE advice on voting had changed, and it was clear that “the house simply cannot conduct isions safely via the lobbies”.He wrote: “There are pinch points in the lobbies where MPs are recorded by clerks and counted by tellers where it would be difficult to maintain social distancing, even though perspex booths were prepared for two of the ision desks.” Such votes would also risk taking longer than allowed under parliamentary proceedings, he added.Hoyle said that if the government and opposition were unable to agree a way forward, he would allow amendments to the government motion for new procedures.Valerie Vaz, the shadow Commons leader, said it was the “latest example of the government in chaos”. She said: “Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to abolish the hybrid remote parliament, which allowed all MPs to take part regardless of their personal circumstances, without any prior notice and against all advice on the last day parliament met.\u0026nbsp“He has bungled it and is now forcing parliament to return early solely to correct his earlier discriminatory move.”Pete Wishart, the Cabinet Office spokesman for the SNP, tweeted: “The government wants us to come back to a parliament that can’t work. An absolute joke.”The Public and Commercial Services union, which represents many security, catering and other support staff in parliament, has also raised concerns about the full return of MPs. The union’s general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said the part-virtual system had worked well, and said it was “strange why the government is in a rush to change course when a second covid spike is such a strong possibility”.A Commons debate on resuming physical sittings before the recess heard concerns from a series of MPs. The former Conservative minister Robert Halfon said the proposals would discriminate and threaten the lives of some MPs.“Is it really morally just to say in effect to MPs, because you are not Tarzan-like and able to swing through the chamber, beating your chest shouting to your constituents: ‘Look, I am here!’ that you are effectively euthanised from the Commons?” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5cf1323b58a223a480885a82a17e2959c2fb115/0_1_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f54a6c521ca91084f2866035f687cc0c","title":"view from barnard castle dominic cummings hes made a mockery of us","story":"Residents criticise police decision not to take action against PM’s aide for trip to beauty spotAt Barnard Castle there has been angry condemnation about the police decision not to take action against Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s most senior aide, after his 52-mile round trip to the beauty spot on 12 April, apparently to test his eyesight.Dan Goldsmith, 43, said: “To come here from Durham isn’t a short journey and it wasn’t an essential journey by any means. It’s clear to everyone that what he did was wrong – it was a breach – and if the police accept that they should be taking actions against him.“It seems to me to be – again – one rule for ordinary people and another for influential people. It’s a sham. The man is an arse and he should have been prosecuted and treated the same way as anyone else would have been in those circumstances.”Hyleen Wood, 58, and Stuart Wood, 55, from Chester-le-Street near Durham, said the whole episode made a mockery of the lockdown.“It is very frustrating and his reasons make very little sense – it was quite clear what we were asked to do. We have all obeyed the rules and he has flouted it in front of us, making a mockery of what we are doing,” she said.Her husband, Stuart, on his first day out since lockdown began after being furloughed from his job at a recycling plant, said Cummings needs to apologise and tell the truth. “I was furloughed on 21 March and I haven’t left my local area since then, apart from to take the dog for a walk.“Cummings should have apologised and Boris Johnson is desperately trying to brush this under the carpet. We were all expected to do our bit, yet he doesn’t appear to have done that and then that whole story about his eyesight – he totally tripped himself up there,” he said.Emily Davies, 26, is 18 weeks’ pregnant and this week had her latest scan, which her partner, Luke Stebbens, 26, was unable to attend.Davies said: “This is our first baby and it’s an important time for us, it’s a time when I’d like him to be present for everything, especially to see the scan, but under the restrictions he can’t be.“And at the same time Dominic Cummings can drive here apparently to test his eyesight. Who drives a car to see whether they can see well enough to drive a car?“If he committed an offence, he should have been prosecuted. If it had been an ordinary member of the public, they’d have been done for it, he should have been treated the same.”Stebbens added: “A friend of mine was fined driving to work. He didn’t realise his workplace wasn’t open but he was still stopped and fined by Durham police. And Cummings goes for a drive apparently to find out if he can see properly and gets away with it. How is that fair?”Dennis Richards, 58, said: “I think people in Barnard Castle have had enough of this issue now and I do feel that it’s a distraction from more important matters when the health of so many people is at risk.“But that said, I think Dominic Cummings should have accepted that what he did was wrong, because it was, and that he should have gone from government one way or another.“It wasn’t a major crime by any means but if you’ve done wrong you should be accountable for it and he hasn’t been.”Meanwhile, Ann-Marie Davies, 55, from Barnard Castle, said: “It is just one of those things and hindsight is a great thing but an apology would have been good. If he had just said: ‘I did it for the best interests of my family’ – it would have been better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

It came out in April 2019 to replace the popular Forerunner 235.The Forerunner 245 resembles a round digital watch and is just 42.3mm wide, 12.2mm thick and 38.5g in weight, which by sports watch standards is tiny, comparing favourably with the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 and the Apple Watch Series 5. It takes standard universal 20mm watch bands and comes with an excellent traditional silicone strap that fits wrists between 127mm and 204mm in circumference: in other words most wrists.The colour transflective LCD display – which is not a touchscreen – can be seen in direct sunlight without the need for a backlight, although there is one for the night. The display is clear and easily readable at a glance, but is pretty basic compared with the flashy OLED screens on smartwatches. Think of it more like an advanced colour digital watch and you will get the idea.There are quite a few watch faces to choose from, including digital and analogue options, plus many more available from third parties via Garmin’s Connect IQ store.The up, down and back buttons take you around the interface. The startstop button doubles as a select button and the light button powers the watch on and accesses quick settings. Press and hold the down button to access music controls or the up button to quickly jump to the full settings menus.From the watch face you can also access a long list of customisable widgets using the up and down buttons, including smartphone notifications, calendar, the weather, health stats, stress levels, your heart rate, previous runs and many others.The Forerunner 245 fully charges in two hours via a short snap-in USB cable that plugs into the back of the watch and can connect to Garmin’s desktop Express software on Windows or Mac.The watch connects to your Android or iPhone via Bluetooth and the Garmin Connect app, which handles syncing data, updates, smart notifications and other bits. The separate Garmin Connect IQ app handles installing apps, including watch faces, widgets and music services.The Forerunner 245 Music also has wifi for syncing your activities straight to the cloud, downloading music and software updates.The Garmin Connect app is extremely comprehensive, able to display an almost bewildering amount of information, with analysis often reserved for pay-for subscriptions elsewhere, such as how effective your training is. Recent updates have made the app a lot more beginner-friendly, particularly for day-to-day health tracking.The Forerunner 245 is generally repairable, but Garmin typically replaces damaged devices with refurbished units for a fee. The battery is not user replaceable, but straps are. The screen is covered in Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3, similar to a smartphone.The Forerunner 245 tracks lots of sports but excels for running with practically every feature you can think of, whether that’s on a treadmill, track, trail or road. The battery lasts up to 24 hours tracking with GPS, and just under six hours playing music.The GPS trails are the most accurate I’ve tested in suburban London, matching distance and routes with very little deviation from maps and race lengths. The time it takes to get a GPS lock, and the strength of that lock, has been drastically improved with a recent software update too, getting a lock within 20 seconds of stepping outdoors most of the time.Garmin’s third-generation heart rate sensor is about as accurate as optical scanners can be too, and for the majority of people will be more than accurate enough for training purposes. If you need better you can connect a chest strap via Bluetooth.During a run you have a series of customisable screens with a varying number of fields and stats on display. The screens are well designed and easy to understand with just a quick glance mid-run.You can get the watch to beep and vibrate when you’ve hit certain milestones, such as laps or distance, and speak things like your average pace every three minutes through Bluetooth headphones. You can also set a target based on distance, time or pace, which is extremely handy for running a 5K without a running track.Alongside VO2 Max estimates, used as an overall measure of fitness, the Garmin can measure performance and tell you if you have worked hard enough. Between six and 20 minutes into your run the watch will beep and give you a positive or negative score, which is either a kick to run harder or confirmation that you’re on track. I find it extremely useful.The Forerunner 245 can track workouts such as interval training too. The watch has a built-in coach with adaptive plans for beginners to intermediates with a 5K time over 21 minutes.But you can easily programme your own or download sessions, based on pace, distance, heart rate zone or other metrics. Running at a pace, for instance, the watch beeps a countdown to the start of the interval.During the sprint the watch beeps when you are over or under your target pace alongside a glanceable dial on screen. It works really well and means you do not need a track, a set place to run or someone with a timer to do effective interval training.The only thing missing is a barometer. You’ll still get elevation data from maps, but if you look to train using elevation this might be a deal-breaker.The Forerunner 245 does a good job of tracking most of the basic cycling stats similar to running (pace, distance, heart rate etc) and can be paired with various external sensors for speed and cadence, plus Garmin’s smart lights.Swimming, including heart rate, lengths, distance, stroke type and count, calories and other bits can be tracked in the pool too. Plus gym workouts and a handful of other activities profiles, such as walking, yoga, rowing and weights.Overall health tracking is also extensive, covering all the usual suspects such as steps, calories, distance, intensity, heart rate, move notifications, menstrual tracking and stress.Garmin’s body battery attempts to track your energy levels during the day to show when best to exercise or rest. The watch tracks sleep, including cycles, heart rate and estimates blood oxygen saturation, and it can alert you when if heart rate spikes when not active. The only thing missing compared to the very best fitness trackers on the market is ECG measurements for your heart.Both versions of the Forerunner 245 can control music playback on a smartphone, but only the Forerunner 245 Music can download tracks and play them without a phone, with a capacity for 3.5GB or 500 tracks.Music in MP3 or AAC format can be transferred via USB cable from the computer using Garmin Express. If you’re a Spotify Premium, Deezer or Amazon Music user, you can install the associated app on your watch and sync music and podcasts directly to the watch via wifi. The Spotify app works really well, although downloading large playlists takes quite some time. Playing Spotify on runs without a phone is a killer feature but reduces the battery life to six hours.Alongside health tracking, the Forerunner 245 has basic smartwatch features, vibrating when you get a text, notification or call on your phone. You can scroll through the text of a notification and clear it, reject a call and that sort of thing.The battery lasts about a week with the screen on, notifications and health-tracking active, including heart rate, which is significantly longer than most smartwatches that only manage up to two days.The smartwatch functions work with both Android and an iPhone. They will not match a true smartwatch, but if you are looking for alerts on your wrist the Garmin does the job.The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a runner’s best friend, and sets a new bar by which most other running watches will be measured.The watch is small, slim and light. The display is very clear and easy to read. It has practically every stat and aid necessary to track, measure and help with running and training, and comprehensive analysis and export of data to many popular services, including Strava.Much of the information will be overkill for casual runners, but for those looking for a tool that works reliably with real buttons and helps them analyse their runs, do intervals and train better, the Garmin ticks practically every box. Seven days’ battery as a watch or 24 hours’ tracking runs doesn’t hurt either. Buy the one with music and free yourself from your phone for motivational tunes or podcasts, including offline Spotify support.It also does a great job of tracking a lot of other activities and features comprehensive general health monitoring too, including sleep, stress and heart rate alerts. Its smartwatch-like features get the basics right without trying to do too much, plus it has a fair few watch faces available and easy-to-swap standard straps.It’s not the cheapest, but the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a truly great running and fitness watch that is easy to live with on a daily basis.Cons: expensive, no barometer, no touchscreen as well as buttons, interface can be a bit clunky, screen fairly basic compared with smartwatches This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It’s an opportunity for everyone from tourist boards to tour operators to reset and to look at how things can be better – for the planet, for local communities and for travellers.”In Venice – one of the most overtouristed cities, with an estimated 25 million foreign visitors a year – officials are using the pause to rethink “an entire Venice system”, with sustainability and quality tourism at its core, said Paola Mar, the city’s councillor for tourism. Part of the plan is to lure locals back to live permanently in the city. The mayor is in discussions with universities, aiming to offer tourist rentals to students, and old buildings are being restored for social housing. Measures to control visitor numbers – including a tax on day trippers, which was due to be introduced in July – will go ahead next year, while the debate around cruise ships continues.“Our goal is to trigger a renaissance of the city,” said Mar. “We want to attract visitors for longer stays and encourage a ‘slower’ type of tourism. Things can’t go back to how they were.”City authorities in Amsterdam – which was struggling to cope with an estimated 18.3 million overnight tourist stays in 2019 – are also quietly hopeful that the pandemic will be a catalyst for change. Last week the mayor urged extreme caution in reopening to tourists, while nonprofit group Amsterdam\u0026ampPartners believes the tourist hiatus pushes to the top of the agenda plans to cut numbers, give Amsterdam back to locals and attract the “right” kind of visitor, and has launched a sustainability taskforce to map the way forward.“We are working with partners to discuss how we can restart in a more sustainable and responsible way,” said Amsterdam\u0026ampPartners spokeswoman Heleen Jansen. “The main focus is that we want a sustainable visitor economy that doesn’t harm the livability of our city. If you have the right balance between living, working and visiting, you can have the right visitor economy. That’s what went wrong in the last years in the old city centre, and we have to entice locals to discover their city centre again.”Meanwhile, the suddenly empty streets of Barcelona have made local businesses and the tourist board re-evaluate their priorities too. “While we couldn’t continue at the speed things were, this is showing us that no tourists is no good either – there needs to be a more moderate way,” said Mateo Asensioof the Barcelona tourist board. “Our first task is getting locals back out into the city, then the domestic market and our neighbours. When the international market returns, we’ll focus more on specific sectors. It’s an opportunity to change the rules.”With the world’s “new normal” including social distancing, an increased fear of crowds and busy places – and the future of airlines in the balance – over-tourism may not be a pressing issue for some time.Other changes in cities around the world include  reshaping in favour of cyclists and pedestrians: Athens is accelerating plans for a car-free historic centre, Berlin is introducing 14 miles of new bike lanes, and Paris is also significantly increasing its bike lanes, to ease potential overcrowding.Destinations likely to see the first surge in visitor numbers are remote coastal and rural areas, places seen as “safe”, said Patricia Yates, acting CEO of Visit BritainVisit England. It will be longer before cities bounce back.“Our weekly consumer sentiment surveys show that the domestic market is very nervous – so we will be focusing initially on reassurance,” she said. “But beyond that we will be looking at promoting areas outside the honeypots. What is needed is destination management to rebuild tourism more slowly and keep residents, visitors and businesses that depend on tourists happy – it’s quite a balancing act.”Some of the progress made on sustainable tourism is likely to go into reverse at first, she added – with people eschewing public transport in favour of car travel and infection control measures leading to more single-use plastic.Many tour operators, however, believe the pandemic could engender a positive change in client behaviour. Intrepid Travel CEO James Thornton said: “During this hibernation period we’ve seen the benefit to nature and the climate – fish spotted in Venice’s clearer canal water, the Himalayas visible in India – and people have had time to reflect. I think customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on the environment and the communities they visit, and make more considered choices.”A renewed focus on slower travel, including train journeys and cycling, as well as keeping experiences as local as possible and offering more off-season departures are part of Intrepid’s post-Covid plans, with wilderness and wellness trips tipped to be of most interest.Launching new adventures in even more remote destinations to assist with economic recovery is on the agenda for Much Better Adventures when tourism opens up again. “The crisis has shown just how much communities in less-developed parts of the world rely on tourism,” said Sam Bruce. “We will look to spread tourism to areas that would genuinely benefit. But it has to be done in the right way. We risk a flood to remote places that aren’t prepared and could be taken advantage of.“I’m hopeful that a new, slower tourism will emerge – but the recovery needs to be slow enough for the industry to make the right decisions as it rises from the ashes.”G Adventures founder Bruce Poon Tip – who has just published Unlearn: The Year the Earth Stood Still, an e-book looking at the impact of the pandemic on tourism – believes the industry can emerge as a stronger force for good.“People will travel again. We don’t yet know when, but we know that they will. I want to challenge everyone who travels to ‘unlearn’ what they think they know. We have the opportunity to use this reset to be more conscious about how we can improve, as iniduals and as a wider travel community.”With the pause likely to be temporary, campaigners from Greenpeace to Flight Free are demanding that airline bailouts come with strict conditions on their future climate impact and say Covid should be the catalyst for greening the world’s airlines.But in a race for economic recovery, rebuilding the industry quickly could sideline climate change and aviation issues, said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, who is calling for a “green flying duty”, with more regulation and tax revenues invested in renewable fuels.The cost of flights is likely to rise in the long term, he added. “Short term, the where and how we travel has had to change. But new, more entrenched, norms could form from that. Many people were hooked on frequent short breaks, but key to more sustainable tourism is taking far fewer flights – we may now see a return to longer, less frequent holidays, with more time spent getting to know a place, and a rise in slower forms of travel.”Whatever happens, it’s unlikely travel will ever be the same as in pre-Covid days. An industry known for its resilience will find a new way forward, adapting to an unknown global market, but whether sustainability can be at the heart of a new model of tourism is hard to predict.“Tourism will be smaller, and so more sustainable per se. Fewer flights means less C02, fewer guests means less waste, and there will be much more focus on localism, at least initially,” said Graham Miller, professor of sustainability in business at the University of Surrey.“How the nature of the product changes, however, remains to be seen. There are huge vested interests to contend with – like the cruise industry in Venice and big businesses – but it feels like the moment we have been waiting for. If we are going to redesign tourism, this is about the best chance we can wish for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c04ba12e9eb982bcfd25b22727fa425c3212747/0_142_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06fedc59e0896a5e77f118ddf8019f4f","title":"new york summer coronavirus covid in pictures","story":"Photographer Jordan Gale was curious to see how New Yorkers would adapt to a post Covid-19 summer.

However, earlier lockdown measures will still be eased in Paris, with parks in the capital due to re-open next week.Philippe said health results have been good so far as the country prepares to enter a second phase in its relaxation of lockdown rules on 2 June.\u0026nbspDeaths from coronavirus in\u0026nbspItaly\u0026nbsprose by 70 on Thursday, down from 117 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 33,142.

Italy has 231,732 confirmed cases to date.Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the Moscow health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes.In 360 of those cases, it noted the coronavirus acted as a catalyst, exacerbating the patients’ conditions and contributing to their deaths. The health department also factored in 169 deaths of people who tested negative but autopsies showed had likely succumbed to the virus.\u0026nbspThe number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week.The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak\u0026nbspin early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week.While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a rate not seen since the Great Depression.\u0026nbspNew York governor\u0026nbspAndrew Cuomo\u0026nbspsaid he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers who are not wearing masks.He said: “That store owner has a right to protect himself.

It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.France Phase two of the country’s exit begins next week. The country began easing lockdown on 11 May, when people were allowed out of their homes without an approved reason, and when non-essential shops opened and some pupils returned to school.Several dozen new coronavirus clusters, some with more than 50 cases, have been detected since. These have been linked to hospitals, abattoirs, hostels, schools and a funeral service. Officials are also seeking to test 400 people who attended an illegal football match in Strasbourg.Epidemiologists have said that 1,000 new cases a day represents “a safe zone” for France. In recent days, between 200 and 400 cases have been recorded, with the R – or reproduction – rate at 0.77 in most of the country. “The virus is still there but the indicators are positive,” said Geneviève Chêne, head of France’s public health agency.GermanyAngela Merkel, the chancellor, has been fighting a rearguard action against the premiers of the country’s 16 states, who have broad powers to decide on confinement measures and want to lift them faster than she would like.Multiple new clusters have occurred since Germany’s comparatively soft lockdown began easing late April. Despite observing physical distancing, more than 100 people were infected after a Baptist church service in Frankfurt on 10 May.More than a dozen also tested positive after a restaurant, in the northern town of Leer, opened again, while sizeable outbreaks have also occurred at Amazon logistic centres and in several meatpacking plants around the country.One slaughterhouse in North-Rhine Westphalia found 270 of its 1,200 workers were infected, while a similar outbreak at another, in Bavaria, boosted the infection rate past 50 per 100,000 residents, the level at which local restrictions must be reimposed.Officials in Berlin, where bars and restaurants reopened on 15 May, said this week the R rate of the virus in the capital had risen to 1.37 from below one. Nationwide, however, new cases have fallen to 400-600 daily, from a peak of 7,000 late March.SpainThe country’s health emergency chief, Fernando Simón, warned again this week that the country’s hard-won progress – new cases in Spain have fallen to about 400-500 a day from more than 7,500 at the peak – must not be taken for granted, saying an outbreak due to “a small, innocent party could be the start of another epidemic”.Simón was speaking after six new cases were discovered in a small town in the south-east Spanish region of Murcia, apparently linked to an agricultural worker who went to work despite showing symptoms of the disease.Spain also had an earlier spike in Lleida, Catalonia, after 20 people gathered for a birthday party,\u0026nbspignoring phase-one lockdown rules\u0026nbspwhich stipulated\u0026nbspgatherings of no\u0026nbspmore than 10 people. Four had the virus and ended up infecting the other 16.\u0026nbspItaly The country had a big jump in cases in its hardest-hit region, Lombardy, after it lifted its strictest lockdown measures on 4 May, its second phase of the emergency. A week later new infections in the region had risen to 1,000 from a few hundred. Lombardy still accounts for most of the country’s 300-600 new daily cases, down from 6,500 daily in March.Denmark The first EU state to begin gradually exiting its lockdown, mid April. It said a fortnight later it had seen “no sign” of the pandemic accelerating, with the R rate remaining below 1. This month its chief epidemiologist said a second wave looked very unlikely.

These included a sustained fall in the daily death rate, sufficient testing capacity and sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE). “We are confident that we have moved beyond the peak,” he said.He acknowledged some of the shortcomings in provision of testing and PPE in the early days of the outbreak, saying: “It’s been immensely frustrating, but we are now making progress.”The chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, underlined the fact that there was little room for manoeuvre, with 54,000 new cases last week, which he called “a significant burden of infection”, and the infection rate, or R, still, “close to 1”.“It’s still the case that the vast majority of us have not had the infection: and this is a virus to which all of us are susceptible,” Vallance said.The prime minister was also keen to underline the limited nature of the changes. “I cannot, and will not, throw away all the gains we have made together – and so the changes we have made are limited and cautious.”Johnson confirmed that outdoor retail, such as markets and car showrooms, will be allowed to open from Monday, and other non-essential shops a fortnight later, provided they abide by Covid-secure guidelines.There will be no respite for those most vulnerable to the virus, who will continue to be asked to “shield” themselves, by remaining at home.“I do understand how difficult his has been for you especially and I want to thank you to all the efforts you have gone to, because your efforts have helped the NHS to cope,” he said.England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the government’s advisers hope to “plot a path” out of shielding, as the infection rate in the community declines – suggesting it would happen in stages.Johnson met the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to discuss the changes earlier on Thursday. “Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4c036d2997f2dab051c1e0427c637822e81aa5/0_198_3010_1806/master/3010.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8d7b93a35bc84eb903bb5ec27ac12503","title":"people scotland can meet groups eight lockdown eased","story":"Other changes from Friday include some sports being allowed and five-mile travel for recreationPeople in Scotland can meet outdoors with another household in groups of up to eight, Nicola Sturgeon said as she proceeded with phase one of the Scottish government’s four-stage plan for moving out of lockdown.Scotland’s first minister insisted a continuing stay-at-home message remained “fundamental” to guidance, warning: “If we all start to go about our daily business too much, then we could see an increase in cases very, very quickly.”The relaxations came as the Scottish government’s own “test and protect” contact-tracing scheme went live on Thursday across all health board areas.Reiterating that her approach to easing restrictions was “careful and cautious” – with the R number (reinfection rate) still in the range of 0.7 to 1 – Sturgeon said that, from Friday, Scots would be able to meet with members of one other household at a time. This must happen outdoors, in a park or private gardens, while observing physical distancing, with a maximum of eight people meeting at one time. There is also a strong recommendation not to meet more than one other household per day.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.She gave the example of those who might want to host picnics or barbecues at the weekend, saying guests from the other household should bring their own food, cutlery, plates and cups.People will be allowed to travel –\u0026nbsppreferably by walking or cycling –\u0026nbspfor recreation,\u0026nbspwith a suggested limit of five miles.\u0026nbspSitting and sunbathing in parks will be permitted, as will\u0026nbspmany\u0026nbspoutdoor non-contact sports\u0026nbspwhere physical distancing is feasible, including\u0026nbspgolf, fishing, tennis and bowls.In terms of business, most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume and the construction industry can start site preparation.\u0026nbspGarden centres and recycling facilities\u0026nbspare also allowed to\u0026nbspreopen, while takeaway and drive-through food outlets will no longer be discouraged.\u0026nbspFrom Monday, teachers can return to schools to prepare for\u0026nbspthe start of the new school year on 11 August,\u0026nbspwhen pupils begin a “blended” model of at-home and in-school learning.\u0026nbspFrom Wednesday, childminding services and fully outdoor nurseries will begin to reopen.\u0026nbspInsisting that she “trusted the judgment of the Scottish people”, Sturgeon admitted to feeling nervous about making changes, saying: “I worry that the limited changes we are making to these rules – the very careful changes – might lead to much greater change in reality.”In particular, she urged people to change their plans if they arrived at beauty spots to find them crowded with other day-trippers over what is forecast to be a warm and sunny weekend.From Thursday, if people in Scotland develop coronavirus symptoms they must immediately book a test by phone or online and isolate themselves – the aim is for all results to be returned within 24 hours. If the test is positive, the inidual will then hear from a contact tracer who will ask them about recent face-to-face contacts, within their household or less than two metres away for 15 minutes or more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a17b43631d12d7ef0f0cde7819018432c4965c37/0_181_6153_3692/master/6153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7101228162f4deef2cb138a153e21b99","title":"test and trace undermined by cummings","story":"Maggi Carr, Trevor Toms, Ruth Windle, Anita Charlton and Sarah Houghton on the government’s new scheme for keeping a lid on Covid-19, and on the prime ministerial adviser’s lockdown breachesThe launch of the test-and-trace system was supposed to be on 1 June, but it was brought forward to 27 May, even though it wasn’t ready (Hancock: it is public’s ‘civic duty’ to follow test-and-trace instructions in England, 27 May).

Grigoryan said he was not aligned with a specific political party and denied that Medmedia or the fact-finding project were political fronts aimed at opposing the government.“If we look at everything from a political point of view then we’re not going to go very far,” he said. “But from an expert point of view, the statistics speak for themselves.”Armenia has reported about 7,100 coronavirus cases and a rising rate of infections. The country has also grappled with a drop in childhood vaccine rates, which the health minister, Arsen Torosyan, has blamed on anti-vaccine propaganda.The State Department declined to comment on questions about the size of the grant or its review process.A post on the US embassy’s website in Armenia said grants under the Democracy Commission Small Grants Program – which are worth up to $50,000 – are awarded on a competitive basis to local NGOs and are meant to focus on issues like transparency and accountability in governance, advancing human rights, eliminating corruption, and enhancing economic growth and development.But the openDemocracy investigation found that, while Medmedia had published some news articles, most of its opinion pieces were republished Facebook posts that spread false information.Grigoryan told the  that the US embassy in Armenia had contacted him with “concerns” about op-eds and articles on the site. But, he said: “I am sure I was able to answer all those questions and those concerns disappeared. The site is not an anti-vaccine forum.”He would not say how much money was given to his Armenian Association for Young Doctors by the US embassy, or how much of that was invested in the website. He called it a “small amount” and addressed questions on specifics to the US embassy. The grant period is due to end in several days, he said.A disclaimer on the Medmedia website said the site was US-funded but that its articles “do not necessarily reflect” the views of the US government.Asked specifically about the articles, he said that he didn’t share their opinions but said they would not be taken down. “It’s not fake news,” he said. “It’s the opinion of a specialist, the opinion of a doctor, of the head of an NGO.

That means many school leaders will have little chance to have time off from February until the middle of July.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:It is important to understand that many primary schools will not be open to all eligible pupils on Monday morning, and that they will be phasing in these children over a period of time, while putting in place limits on class sizes and implementing other safety measures.Schools are already open to vulnerable and key worker children, and it is now a case of carefully and cautiously expanding these numbers.There are significant logistical issues involved, including constraints on the physical space in schools, and the availability of staff, given that some will be self-isolating or in vulnerable categories.There is also likely to be a great deal of variability in how many parents send their children into schools. Added to this is the fact that local authorities are taking different approaches.All of this means the picture from Monday will vary widely between schools and areas according to local circumstances. We urge everybody to understand this is an extraordinary situation and to respect the decisions that are made by schools.Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. But Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, warned:Many parents will be understandably hesitant about sending their children to a childcare provider reopening on Monday and as such it is very likely that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders will see a significant drop in demand for places in the short-term, which will result in a loss of income. The government must therefore offer more than just a public health solution to the reopening of the early years sector and commit whatever financial support is required to ensure that providers can remain financially sustainable during this period. During that very interesting press conference, the prime minister tried to stop his top medical and scientific advisors from answering reporters’ questions about the behaviour of Dominic Cummings, saying they should not be involved in politics.Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific advisor, were repeatedly asked if the trip by Cummings from London to Durham set a bad example to the general public.Twice Boris Johnson refused to allow them to answer, saying he wanted to “protect them from ... an unfair and unnecessary attempt to ask a political question”.On a third occasion, when Johnson allowed them to speak, both officials then said they did not want to get involved in politics and declined to address the question.Cummings’ behaviour has been criticised by politicians from all major parties, but Johnson has said he wanted to move on from the affair.Q. In Northern Ireland the R has been increasing and is barely below 1 – should that cause alarm?Vallance says the R remains below 1 everywhere but may be very close to 1 in some places.We have to be very cautious with these changes, he adds.There will be local outbreaks so we must be prepared for that, he says.The number of cases remains high and we have to get them down by adhering to the measures in place, he says.Q. Given that lives are at stake, if the public health advice becomes bastardised by the actions of Dominic Cummings, can you at least criticise how he has acted given the gravity of what’s happened?And that’s the end of the press briefing.Q. Do you really have the capacity to trace all the contacts of infected people?Q. Why is the UK still only listing three symptoms for the disease compared to other countries?Vallance says the number of new cases appears closer to 8,000 a day, but that’s clearly not the whole number – there are people we’re not picking up.The app and contact tracing will help close this gap and get people to isolate quickly.Q. How long can people stay at another person’s private garden, can you go inside to use the loo and when can we hug loved ones again?Johnson says no to overnight stays as we’re not at that stage.All of these adjustments have to be in socially distanced way, with people continuing to wash their hands and use common sense, he adds.We can’t move freely across the country to stay at other people’s houses, he adds.Whitty says the two metre rule is critical because the virus spreads in air droplets.After using the loo, wipe everything down and wash your hands, he adds.Plus if you’re passing things from one person to another, e.g. when doing a BBQ, you must be washing your hands and wiping everything down, he adds.Whitty says he and Vallance don’t want to get involved in politics.Vallance adds that as a civil servant he doesn’t want to be involved at all.Q. Are the instructions from contact tracers instructions that you must follow whatever your childcare arrangements or your job?Johnson says if you get a call from a contact tracer, you must self-isolate.Whitty adds you must do this to protect all of us.Q. A number of scientific advisers to Sage have said Cummings’ behaviour risks more people not complying with social distancing rules. Do Vallance and Whitty fear compliance will be reduced because of this?Q. Is Sage looking at whether the social distancing rule can be reduced from two metres?Johnson again doesn’t let Vallance and Whitty answer the question on Cummings.On the two metre rule, Vallance says the scientific evidence suggests two metres is a distance at which it’s safer and other measures add to this, e.g. wearing face masks.Whitty adds that if, under test and trace, you remained two metres apart from an infected person, you won’t count as a contact and have to isolate.Q. Durham police have said they would have sent Dominic Cummings home if they had stopped him at Bernard Castle, why should anyone else follow the rules if one of your senior team isnt’?Johnson says the police said they would take no action and he intends to draw a line under the matter.Astonishingly, he doesn’t let Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof Chris Whitty answer on the grounds it’s a “political” matter, and he doesn’t allow a follow-up.Carol from Sunderland asks what measures will be put in place for people would could temporarily lose their income if local lockdowns are imposed.Johnson says help such as the furlough scheme and various loan schemes remain in place.Nobody should be penalised in this epidemic for doing the right thing, he adds.Jay from Horsham asks how loosening the lockdown for the shielding community – the clinically vulnerable – is going to be approached.Johnson says he sympathises with how tough it’s been and he wants to release them from “captivity” as quickly as possible but they must be vigilant in their approach.Whitty says the risk to the shielded and other vulnerable groups is decreasing and they hope to soon get to a stage where the risk is low enough for people to leave shielding in stages.Vallance says the most recent ONS figures suggest:The number of new infections is estimated to be roughly 1 in 1,000 per week, he says.This means 54,000 new cases are estimated to be occurring every week – that is not a low number, he stresses.There is still a significant burden of infection, there are still new infections every day at quite a significant rate, and the R is close to 1, he says.That means there isn’t a lot of room to do things and things to need to be done cautiously and monitored, and the test and trace system needs to be effective, he says.The R is currently somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9, he says.It remains close to 1, and it could be much closer to 1 in some areas, he says.The numbers are coming down at the moment, but they’re not coming down fast, he says.He hopes in the coming weeks we’ll be able to do more in returning to a more normal way of life, Johnson says.This is all conditional, he adds, based on the scientific data confirming that these actions are safe.There will be further local outbreaks, he says. The brakes will be put on as required and where necessary, measures will be reimposed, he adds."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Unthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debateRite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong time"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A debate has been happening in recent days on whether the recommended two metres of physical distancing with others to avoid the spread of the coronavirus can be reduced safely to one metre.So what is the current guidance in Ireland?The public health advice the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is that people should maintain a distance of two metres to avoid the spread of Covid-19. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at the weekend “there is no change” to the two-metre rule.Why is this?HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said on Sunday the two-metre distance was based on the projected distance that a droplet containing the virus can spread to another person through cough and sneezing. The decision to maintain a two-metre distance was the reason, he said, why the reproduction rate in the speed of the virus had fallen to the point where it is now suppressed. So who wants it reduced to one metre?Some Government ministers and other politicians. There was a debate at Cabinet last Friday evening about whether the recommended distance should be reduced to one metre as it would make it easier for people in education, healthcare and other areas of work and could help businesses such as restaurants reopen more quickly.Would it help the health service?Yes, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said that it would help the health service treat more patients and create “significantly extra capacity” across the HSE in emergency departments, waiting rooms and other areas if the recommended distance was one metre. What’s the international advice?The World Health Organisation considers a one-metre distance between people to be safe. So what level of protection does this provide?WHO’s special envoy on Covid-19 David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, said that two metres “keeps you safe 99 per cent of the time but you can greatly reduce risk even at one metre because 70 per cent of the droplets will stick within one metre.”What other international advice is there?The European Centre for Disease Control still advises people to maintain a distance of two metres, while in the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to stay “at least six feet” - about two metres - apart.Has there been similar differing views among public health specialists in Ireland?Yes, NPHET’s expert advisory group said in March that there was a “lack of evidence in distinguishing between one and two metres.” Dr Cillian de Gascun, chairman of the group and director of the UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that in some circumstances such as in healthcare and domestic settings where it is not possible or practical to maintain two metres distance “the recommendation is that at least one metre but ideally two metres are maintained between people, especially in the context of keeping distance from symptomatic iniduals.”Are there other views out there in Ireland?Yes, the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre advised healthcare workers in March to maintain a physical distance of at least one metre but ideally two from iniduals with respiratory symptoms in suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases. In another guidance note advising how to minimise the risk of transmission in pharmacies on March 16th, the HPSC said that “if a healthcare worker can maintain a distance of one metre from the patient’s mouth and nose, they are not within the likely range of droplet transmission. This helps protect both.”Are there risks by moving back to one metre?Yes. Infectious diseases expert Prof Sam McConkey said that moving closer to one another would “inevitably lead to more transmission of Covid-19” and that a one-metre limit could result in “up to four times more transmission.” He described the decision being a “political choice.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Two more coronavirus deaths also reported in Northern IrelandCoast guard called into action when inflatable floated out from Littor beach in Co KerryWarm and sunny weather is expected to last over the June bank holiday weekendCourt hears man spent over \u0026euro8000 between the Westbury and Shelbourne hotelsTwo more coronavirus-related deaths in the North brings toll to 518Brian Hayes says those who apply for relief after June 30th will \u0026lsquofall into another category\u0026rsquoJudge seeks clarity on admissions during pandemic after 15 facilities unable to accept womanPriests were contacted by Dublin Archdiocese and reminded of their responsibilitiesNTA asks local authorities to consider making streets pedestrian-onlyMan with mental health conditions living in appalling squalor, HSE tells courtFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD says he resents claims that people on pandemic benefit \u0026lsquogaming the system\u0026rsquoJudge says gang involved in murder, drug and weapon trafficking as Mark Capper sentenced\u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore asking you to keep the public health advice in mind, whatever your plans\u0026rsquoIrish Human Rights and Equality Commission warns department over \u0027school profiling\u0027 concernsSchool capacity will still be curtailed even if need for two-metre distance reduced to oneData shows mortality rate in some homes as proportion of occupancy above 40 per centSurvey by Barnardos finds sibling rows, pent up energy and loss of routine creating issuesCivil liberties group voices concern over mandatory passenger locator formHospital group still providing daily \u0026lsquohealth check\u0026rsquo to Dealgan House nursing homeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264681.1590682972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures could reach into high twenties on thursday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTemperatures on Thursday could reach as high as 28 degrees, with the warm and sunny weather expected to last for the June bank holiday weekend, Met Éireann has said.

Temperatures will remain warm, from low to mid-twenties. The coolest areas will be along the south and east coasts. There could be some hazy sunshine tomorrow and some cloud over the weekend, but it will generally be sunny.”Gorse firesMeanwhile, the Department of Agriculture has issued a status red warning for gorse fires for the duration of the bank holiday weekend. The warning arises from increased temperatures and low rainfall levels.Dublin Fire Brigade said firefighters from Tallaght were called to grass on fire on Wednesday, whilst a crew from Finglas fought straw bales alight in Meakstown.The Irish Coastguard has reminded the public to exercise caution in the water following two call outs in West Cork on Wednesday. It warned the public that in spite of the high temperatures on land the sea is still cold. Shortly after 2pm emergency services received calls when four teenage boys got in to trouble in the water in Inchydoney. The Rescue 115 Shannon, Courtmacsherry RNLI, gardaí and the ambulance service responded. The teens were taken from the water shortly after. Two of the teenagers were suffering from hypothermia and required medical intervention. Nearly an hour later Union Hall RNLI was tasked by Valentia Coastguard amid reports that two swimmers were missing in Glandore in West Cork.In a statement Union Hall RNLI said they received a report at 3.20pm yesterday that two swimmers were missing in the area. LifeboatThe lifeboat ILB Margaret Bench of Solihull launched with three volunteer crew from Union Hall.The lifeboat commenced a search in Glandore but shortly after the two swimmers arrived into the pier. The volunteer crew were stood down and returned back to the lifeboat station at 4pm. Also on the scene were Toe HeadGlandore Coast Guard Unit.Following the call out Deputy Launch Authority Jim Moloney said it was a “false alarm with good intent.”“If you are going swimming always let someone know where you are going and what time you are due back at, and always respect the water,” he said.Kevin O’Hagan, cancer prevention manger with the Irish Cancer Society, said: “One of the simplest things you can do to protect your skin from UV rays is to stay in the shade particularly between 11am – 3pm, even on cloudy days as much as 90 per cent of UV rays can reach your skin and cause damage that can lead to skin cancer later in life. “When in Ireland wear sunscreen, SPF 30 or higher from April to September to reduce your risk of skin cancer. But remember that using sunscreen alone will not give enough protection against UV rays.“It is important to use shade, clothes and sunglasses too. In this way you get the best possible protection from UV damage. “Finally, check with Met Éireann for the daily UV index.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Proposals on the future of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will be brought forward “over the next week or so”, Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty has said.Introducing revised financial estimates for her department, which is seeking an additional €6.8 billion to cover the weekly €350 payments and a wage subsidy scheme, Ms Doherty said she was happy to confirm again that the payments would extend beyond the original June end date.“Any future decisions will be based on our commitment that everyone who needs help will get the most appropriate assistance and also based on the evidence we receive from the reopening of the economy,” she said.The Minister added that “we are currently considering this and intend to bring forward proposals for some changes over the next week or so”.A call had been made for people to be given certainty about the future of the payment and wage subsidy scheme as the Dáil debated the revised estimates.Fianna Fáil social protection spokesman Willie O’Dea warned that there should not be a “cliff edge” drop from €350 to the €205 paid as jobseeker’s allowance.He said he could not believe that approval was being sought for €6.84 billion of social welfare payments “but without any information whatsoever about the future” of the PUP.‘Gaming the system’Mr O’Dea said he resented recent references to 200,000 people who are apparently being better off while receiving the payment than working. He criticised allegations that they were “gaming the system” and lying on the couch watching TV rather than going back to work.He said 40 per cent of those on the payment had previously been earning €300 or less and the “vast majority” were working part time.Mr O’Dea said those talking about PUP recipients being better off “are blissfully unaware that the Government has clearly signalled that if the pandemic payment exceeds their earnings there will be a clawback”.Ms Doherty said that while there was fraud in the system in the same as every country, it was small numbers in this case.“There is nobody gaming the system and nobody will lose their payment,” she said, adding that the payments would not suddenly be “ripped away”.The Minister said she was seeking approval for the additional funds, which would bring the estimate for her department to more than €28 billion for the year. She said the extraordinary events brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic meant the original estimate “will no longer be sufficient to cover the expenditure of the department”.Much earlierShe said given the scale of the “exceptional measures” needed in response to the pandemic “we will within the next week or so, reach the ceiling” when 80 per cent of allocated funding would be used up. This was happening “much earlier in the year than we could have considered possible a few months ago”, she said.Ms Doherty said the funding was not just for “payments related to the pandemic but also to all of our ordinary payments - child benefit, pensions, carers’ payments, payments to lone parents, payments to people with disabilities and much more besides”.“As we gradually move through the phases of reopening our society, we do need to review the nature of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and how it fits into cross-Government plans to keep Ireland healthy and get the country working again,” she said.CategoriesThe Dáil heard there are 13 different categories of expenditure related to Covid-19 which give rise to the requirement for the additional €6.8 billion. The PUP and wage subsidy scheme would cost €4.3 billion up to June 12th and jobseeker’s related benefits would costs nearly €4.2 billion for the year, Ms Doherty said.The Minister said the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance costing an additional €98.9 million while enhanced illness benefit to for Covid-related illness or self-isolation was estimated at €74 million.Rent supplement is projected to cost an extra €70 million, increased spending on redundancy is estimated at €44.5 million and insolvency costs are estimated at €8.9 million. Four additional weeks of fuel allowance in March and April cost €34 million and €5.5 million has been provided for 1,000 additional places on the community employment and Tús schemes.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Former cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Tired of the relentless negativity of the news cycle? Bored of endlessly cynical mainstream broadcasters?Then this is the podcast you’ve been looking for: Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.Yet Pearson and Halligan have much in common. They both boast high-level political access – and lace politics into their writing, although rarely from a “Westminster village” perspective. They both have older children and, unlike so many London-centric journalists, live outside the M25.What unites them, above all, is that Pearson and Halligan are staunchly and proudly “normal” – both hailing from unflashy, proletarian, non-professional backgrounds, the first in their respective families to go to university. That’s one reason they share a reputation for shrewd political analysis and trend-spotting - knowing in their bones, often before the Westminster crowd, how “ordinary people” think.“You know that moment when you’re watching a TV panel discussion and finally – finally! – someone says something you agree with,” says Pearson. “That’s what Planet Normal is all about!”Pearson and Halligan have between them spent almost forty years penning national newspaper columns, winning countless awards for their writing and broadcasting. They both feel strongly that the media is now far less representative of the broader UK population than when they started out.“It’s become much harder in recent years for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into high-end journalism,” says Halligan. “We\u0027ve made progress in terms of gender and ethnic ersity, but there’s now far less ersity in terms of opinion – with much of the broadcast media, in particular, dominated by privileged insiders holding the same approved views”.Planet Normal is a small but spirited attempt to counter that. In their 30-minute weekly podcast, Pearson and Halligan will review the news in the same sharp, irreverent, down-to-earth style they bring to their writing. The emphasis will be on calling out pomposity, lifting the lid on reality and countering political spin.And, on their trips to Planet Normal, Pearson and Halligan will be bringing along fabulous guests for the ride, representing all parts of the news cosmos – from politics to showbiz, from finance to culture – while responding to questions from Planet Normal listeners.Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.To make sure you never miss an episode, subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, or search \u0027Planet Normal\u0027 on your podcast app.Join Liam Halligan and Allison Pearson in the comments section of this article at 1pm (BST) today to discuss their new podcast and more.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"love blooms time coronavirus borders open","story":"Ulla Lundgaard was relaxing in front of the television with her long-term German boyfriend Andreas when Denmark\u0027s Prime Minister dropped the bombshell that would tear their lives apart.It was unbelievable -- you are sitting on the couch on Friday evening listening to a speech by your prime minister and she’s saying \u0027we’re shutting down the border tomorrow morning,\u0027 the 50-year-old remembered. My whole world broke down.The couple, who have been together since 2003, met because each runs their own, separate container businesses, Ulla on the Danish island of Funen, and Andreas in Hamburg.Andreas drove back to Hamburg the next day, leaving Ms Lundgaard to host her 50th birthday party alone three days later.On Tuesday he was finally able to return after the Danish government on Monday eased its strict border rules.Since this Monday the girlfriends and boyfriends of Danish residents have been allowed to cross the border, so long as they live in Germany or another Nordic country, have been in a relationship for at least six months, the relationship has involved regular face-to-face meetings, and they are able to document the relationship with emails, text messages, photos, letters or other evidence.He arrived at the border carrying a letter from Ms Lundgaard, a copy of her will leaving him her money, and copies of their emails, ready to show them to the waiting guard.Now back in Denmark, Andreas says the experience of returning has been amazing and unreal at the same time.  He added: Everybody’s all of a sudden thinking that corona has gone and therefore no need of taking care of each other any longer! We are so afraid that this will result in the border closing again, simply because some people are just too stupid or ignorant to understand or accept the new rules in our society”It is a dilemma faced by many across the world: how can love survive in a time of coronavirus lockdowns?Ms Lundgaard is most angry about the government\u0027s decision to previously let in only married partners.He talks, reads and writes Danish now, he’s part of the local fitness club, all his clothes, his shaving gear, and all his things are here, she complained. Denmark is like his home.I think it\u0027s unfair to say, \u0027if you’re married you can come, but if you’re a boyfriend you can’t come. The government is treating our life partners as tourists.”But Andreas is more supportive of Denmark\u0027s government.I understand why they closed the border, and I also understand why they did it so quick, he said. They made the right decision, just look at the figures today. If you compare to Great Britain today, which did not lock down the borders, they have a point.”But once you open up for married couples you should also open up for life partners, everything else is a total lottery and unfair”.Caroline Ørsum, a children\u0027s writer based in Copenhagen, has been in a long-term relationship with Soumu, who comes from Kolkata but lives in Finland, for a year.Soumu has been flying to Denmark about every three weeks. We\u0027ve also spent Christmas and New Year together, and we\u0027ve also been able to go on small workations together, since we\u0027re both self-employed.After the border opened to romantic partners she hopes to be reunited with Soumu next month. Hopefully, he\u0027s going to come here in two weeks,” she said. It\u0027s been really stressful --  especially the part about not knowing anything, not having any idea and so your imagination is free to run wild.They each celebrated their birthdays during the period when they were separated.We made the same cake in two countries, so we\u0027ve been watching ourselves on Skype eating the same cake.  . . but it\u0027s not quite the same on Skype as in real life.Ms Ørsum was so frustrated by the border closure that on May 8, she started a Facebook group for lovers separated by coronavirus border closures.Of the 291 members of Ms Ørsum\u0027s group, 25 have a lover in the UK, 17 in the US, 15 in Germany, and 8 in the Netherlands. Another couple left ided by the border closure - and who will not benefit from its partial reopening - are Canadian Melinda Schneider and her Danish boyfriend Adrian Carlsen.They met in February 2018, when he travelled to her hometown, Bradford in Ontario, to play for the local Bradford Bulls ice hockey team.Until the lockdown the two had been seeing each other every two to three months, with Melinda travelling to Denmark, where Adrian is now playing for the Hvidovre Fighters.To be separated due to these closed borders has been increasingly difficult, especially not knowing that there is any hope of us being united again in the near future,” she said.The reopening of the border only includes those resident in Germany and the Nordic countries.We genuinely don’t understand what my nationality has to do with my likelihood of infection, said Ms Schneider. Since Ontario is the last province in Canada to do any opening, I have been home and isolating since I was laid off from my jobs and university converted to online instruction on March 15th.Bente Strand, 77, from Nykøbing on the Danish island of Falster, met her American sweetheart Matthew Gruskin, 78, while backpacking in Greece back in 1965.The couple hitchhiked around the Middle East, before travelling on a Vespa from Athens to Amsterdam. She then lived with him for a year in New York while he finished his law degree. When she returned to Denmark, however, they drifted apart.After Ms Gruskin\u0027s second wife died seven years ago, he got back in touch and the couple have been conducting a passionate late-life romance ever since.But as Mr Gruskin is American, the border relaxation does not apply to the couple.Those of us with sweethearts of other nationalities find it very unfair, Ms Strand complained. Why not our sweethearts? We are very happy that others are able to see their lovers again, but we can\u0027t, and we don\u0027t know when we can be together again.The two have spent more than half of their time together over the past seven years. They had been planning on meeting in Ireland in May, and then flying to Denmark in June before going to see the Faroe Islands.We are not young any longer,” said Ms Strand. “Which is why we don\u0027t want to waste any time. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can see family friends yet lockdown uk social distancing","story":"This offers hope to families who have struggled to be apart from their loved-ones while restrictions have been in place. Since May 13, people have only been able to meet with one person from outside of their household, outdoors. Before that they could not meet anyone from outside of their household. People will be able to see their family and friends in groups of no more than six, as long as they have not been instructed to shield by the Government, and should remain outdoors.It is still forbidden to meet friends and family inside a home. People should only enter a home that is not their own if they need to do this to get to the garden.Mr Johnson said: These changes mean that friends and family can start to meet their loved ones, perhaps seeing both parents at once or both grandparents at once, and I know that for many people this will be a long awaited and joyful moment.But I must stress that to control the virus everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules and stay two metres apart from those you do not live with.Groups of six do not have to be from just two different households, but the Prime Minister said during the announcement that minimising contact with others is still the best way to avoid transmission.He added: You should avoid seeing too many people from different households in quick succession.The rules are set to be relaxed further in line with coronavirus infections across the country continuing to fall.Mr Johnson said that the new changes that are coming into effect from June 1 are limited and cautious, adding that he cannot and will not throw away the progress that has so far been made in limiting the spread of the virus.The most recent changes are based on a scheme trialled in New Zealand where different household bubbles can mix.The same rules are now also in place in Northern Ireland, where groups of up to six people from different households can meet up, as long as they follow social distancing.Before any further changes are introduced, the impact of the newly relaxed restrictions will be assessed.The strategy adds: In addition, the Government is also examining how to enable people to gather in slightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.Over the coming weeks, the Government will engage on the nature and timing of the measures in this step, in order to consider the widest possible array of views on how best to balance the health, economic and social effects.For the first seven weeks of lockdown, the UK was told unequivocally that they could only go outside to exercise once a day. Now, however, the Prime Minister is encouraging people to take “more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise”.It is also now allowed to sit in the sun in your local park, drive to other destinations for exercise regardless of distance from your home, and to play sports - but all of this can only be done with up to five other people for socially distant activities such as tennis and golf.Social distancing during exercise should continue between people who do not live together. The restrictions on outdoor exercise have been eased in line with the advice of Sage, the Government\u0027s scientific advisers.Mr Johnson said: Crucially, transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside.He stressed that despite the relaxed measures, people must continue to “obey the rules on social distancing”, and in order to enforce those rules there will be an increase in the fines for the people who break them.The Government will to continue to ensure that people who are more clinically vulnerable to coronavirus than others take precautions and minimise contact with people outside of their households.This group is strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact, called ‘shielding’. It means not leaving the house or attending gatherings at all, with very limited exceptions.Those identified as vulnerable have been asked to shield until at least June 30, as part of a 12-week time period designed to protect them during the peak of the virus.As a result of this, new rules on seeing more people outside of your household do not apply to all of those who are currently shielding.I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so, the Prime Minister said, adding that the Government will is looking carefully at how to better support those who are shielding.Diabetics could be forced to shield at home against Covid-19 following a review by government scientists after it emerged sufferers are at significantly greater risk of dying if they catch the virus.In his public address on May 10, the Prime Minister urged members of the public to “avoid public transport if at all possible” because of the need to maintain social distancing, and as a result of this, capacity on public transport will therefore be limited. The Prime Minister added that public transport operators will be following “Covid-secure standards”.He also urged those who must go to work to get there by walking or bicycle where possible. The Government will increase funding and provide new statutory guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements, create pop-up cycle lanes, and close some roads in cities to traffic (apart from buses) as some councils are already proposing.Social distancing guidance on public transport must be followed rigorously, and passengers are now being encouraged to wear cloth face coverings as a precautionary measure. He said the Government was working with tech firms to develop apps to allow people to “find out what parts of the transport network are overcrowded and avoid them” to maintain social distancing after lockdown. The Government will be managing the risk of transmissions from abroad, in order to keep overall levels of infection down. First, the Government will require all international arrivals to disclose information about their contact and accommodation. They will also be strongly advised to download and use the NHS contact tracing app, which is expected to be rolled out nationally in June.Second, the Government will require all international arrivals not on a short list of exemptions to self-isolate in their accommodation for 14 days on arrival into the UK from June 8 or they could face a £1,000 fine. Where international travellers are unable to demonstrate where they would self-isolate, they will be required to do so in accommodation arranged by the Government.The Government is working closely with the devolved administrations to coordinate implementation across the UK. Small exemptions to these measures will be in place to provide for continued security of supply into the UK.International travel measures will not come into force on May 13 but will be introduced as soon as possible. One of the most significant changes announced by the Prime Minister recently has been who the Government believes should now be going to work. Previously, guidance was that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you absolutely must. However, Mr Johnson has now said that anyone who can’t work from home - those working in construction or manufacturing, for instance - should be “actively encouraged to go to work”. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will reopen from June 1, with all other non-essential shops set to reopen on June 15 as part of the biggest easing of lockdown restrictions to date.The Prime Minister has said that in order to ensure workplaces are safe, the Government has been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces “Covid-19 secure”.The Government has been consulting the relevant sectors, unions and authorities, including Public Health England, to develop new safety guidelines that can be adapted for workplaces to operate safely, and will release guidelines this week.It will also include measures that were unlikely to be effective when the virus was so widespread that full stay-at-home measures were required, but that may now have some effect as the public increase the number of social contacts.The Government will need to continue to ask all employers and operators of communal spaces to be innovative in developing novel approaches UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) will welcome grant applications for proposals to develop new technologies and approaches that help the UK mitigate the impact of this virus.Other recommendations include installing plexiglass screens between desks in offices and requiring workers not to sit face-to-face but back-to-back or side-to-side, lifts only being used if half-empty, hot-desking abolished and workers not sharing equipment.Staggered arrival and departure times for employees are also being considered, as well as providing staff with packaged meals to avoid opening canteens.The drafted social distancing guidance remains quite stringent for non-office workers. For example, guidance for couriers and lorry drivers suggests finding alternatives to two-person delivery, and building sites and farms should be separated into “zones” of different worker groups with staggered break times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dinosaur breed usually found china brazil discovered uk first","story":"A dinosaur breed usually only found in China and Brazil has been discovered in the UK for the first time by a fossil collector walking his dog on the beach.The jawbone from a pterodactyl was unearthed at Sandown Bay on the Isle of Wight and identified by a palaeontology student from the University of Portsmouth.With a finely pointed beak, the peculiarly shaped fragment is specific to a group of pterosaurs called ‘tapejarids’, which are most commonly found in China and Brazil.Tapejarids were unique in that they had no teeth, but tiny holes which held minute sensory organs for detecting food.It is hoped the discovery will prompt a renewed drive to find out if other similar fossils are lurking on the Isle of Wight and across the UK.The researchers have pledged to scour the archives of the Natural History Museum in London to ensure there are none from the same species which have been overlooked.Professor David Martill, from the University of Portsmouth, told The Daily : Tapejarids were first discovered in Brazil in the 1980s then ten years later in China. There were none found in Europe until five years ago when one turned up in Spain, then another was found in Africa.This one on the Isle of Wight is absolutely delightful. I really hope this will lead to future discoveries. When lockdown is voer, we should encourage kids to go fossil collecting on the beach!Megan Jacobs, the student who identified the jawbone, said she was gobsmacked when the fossil collector, Mick Green, put it down on his kitchen table as they shared a cup of tea.I had a look and instantly recognised it as a pterosaur beak, she told The Daily .My colleagues at the University of Portsmouth had been studying some Moroccan pterosaur beaks, so I\u0027d been seeing very similar material at university. This was very exciting, as no one had found a pterosaur beak before on the Isle of Wight.It feels great to be involved in such an important discovery. Part of what I love about fossil collecting is you never know what\u0027s going to turn up, and Mick always has a different fossil waiting every time we visit for a cuppa!The jawbone has been donated to the Dinosaur Isle Museum at Sandown.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emily maitlis asked night newsnight tory mps say tone biased","story":"Newsnight host Emily Maitlis said she has been overwhelmed by support from viewers as she revealed it was her decision not to appear on the show which aired after the Dominic Cummings monologue row.The BBC ruled that the presenter\u0027s comments on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s chief adviser breached impartiality rules.Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski said he refused to appear on the show, claiming that Maitlis\u0027 tone was aggressive and confrontational.He said: I had to decline Newsnight interview last night on Mr Cummings as I find Emily Maitlis to be extraordinarily aggressive,unnecessarily rude, biased and confrontational to point of intimidation.This behaviour would not be tolerated in any normal workplace so why do we accept fro BBC.Watch the introduction below:Mark Damazer,  former head of BBC Radio 4, also backed his former employers. In an article for the New Statesman, he wrote: As a columnist this would all be fine. But BBC presenters, even when there is a popular view about an issue, are not supposed to turn into columnists.The BBC\u0027s statement on 27 May – with the punchline: \u0027the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality\u0027 – was right, clear and prompt. The programme\u0027s introduction was criticised by Chris Green, Conservative MP for Bolton West, who said on Twitter that it had a clear bias and had nothing to do with the BBC\u0027s mission to inform and educate.He added: We do not need Newsnight to behave as poor quality entertainment.But the vast majority of those who watched Newsnight or a clip of the introduction were in Maitlis\u0027 corner.The 49-year-old broadcaster tweeted: Been overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages - and support on here - and I\u0027ve probably missed much of it.A big thank you from us all at Newsnight.Her absence the night after the monologue sparked suggestions that she had been replaced on the flagship BBC Two show, but Maitlis said she had asked for the evening off.She tweeted: So grateful to my friend and excellent colleague Katie Razzall for stepping in...She did so because I asked for the night off - knowing tonight\u0027s programme would be in the most excellent hands.Razzall also tweeted: Just for the record, Emily Maitlis has not been asked by the BBC to take tonight off - and if I thought she had been, I certainly wouldn\u0027t have agreed to present the show.In her introduction to Tuesday\u0027s show, Maitlis said Mr Cummings had broken the rules and the country can see that, and it\u0027s shocked the Government cannot.She said: The longer ministers and the Prime Minister tell us he worked within (the rules), the more angry the response to this scandal is likely to be.The public mood is one of fury, contempt and anguish, she said.Following controversy over the monologue, the BBC issued a swift response.It said staff had been reminded of the guidelines around impartiality, adding that the corporation must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output.The programme should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality, the BBC said.Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan branded the BBC statement utterly disgraceful, saying the corporation was chucking one of its best journalists under the bus for telling the truth.His words were echoed by journalist and former Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason, who said the decision made him sick.National Union of Journalists general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: At a time of national crisis, frank and fearless journalism that scrutinises and holds this Government to account is more necessary than ever.She said it was clear as day that Mr Cummings breached lockdown rules, adding: Journalists should be congratulated for holding policymakers to account for actions that risk a monumental breach of trust during a public health crisis.Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the broadcaster had responded rapidly to the incident.He tweeted: For the BBC to come out, in such terms, so quickly is really something, no circling of the wagons - issuing what is effectively a written warning.The Newsnight coverage centred on a trip by Mr Cummings from London to Durham during the lockdown. The Downing Street aide insists he acted reasonably and legally.Last year, the BBC became embroiled in an impartiality row over on-air comments made by BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty about US President Donald Trump and racism.Munchetty was previously judged to have breached BBC editorial guidelines when she discussed remarks made by Mr Trump after he told female Democrats to go back to their own countries.The ruling was later reviewed and reversed by the corporation\u0027s director-general, Lord Hall.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"five uk mercenaries offered 150000 fly helicopters gen haftar","story":"Five British mercenaries involved in an operation to fly assault helicopters for Libya’s renegade General Khalifa Haftar were offered bounties of up to $150,000 each for their role in the daring plot which went awry. The men, comprised of former Royal Marines and RAF personnel, were among 20 foreign mercenaries who traveled to Libya last June in an operation to pilot assault helicopters and speed boats to intercept Turkish ships ferrying weapons to Haftar’s opponents – the UN-backed government in Tripoli.A source with knowledge of the secret UN report which revealed the plot told The Daily  that the men involved were believed on sums of “$30,000 to $50,000 a month, or $20,000 to $40,000 per month depending on whether you were pilot or aircrewman”.The  can reveal that the UN investigation concluded that the operation was led by Steven Lodge, a former South African Air Force officer who also served in the British military.Mr. Lodge, who now resides in Scotland, is a director of Umbra Aviation, a South-Africa based company that has recently supplied helicopters to the Government of Mozambique, where the country is battling a jihadist insurgency in its restive north.Speaking to The  over the phone, Mr. Lodge flatly denied the chronicle of events detailed in the UN report. “All the info is incorrect - the whole facts behind the whole thing,” he said.“The fact that the UN is leaking is unethical, to say the least,” he added. The operation was dubbed “Project Opus”, and was run under the cover story of a “geophysical and hyperspectral survey of Jordan.Yet, the report, prepared for the United Nations’ Sanctions Committee, alleges that the operation ended in farce after General Haftar disputed the quality of helicopters that had been bought in from South Africa via Mozambique.The 20 men were forced to flee by RHIB to Malta, some 350 miles away on June 2nd, barely four days after their arrival. In Malta, they were arrested upon arrival and subsequently released without charge.Another of those involved is Andy Furness, a former RAF crewman who spent 26 years in the military before, serving until 2011.Mr. Furness is now CEO of Amber Tiger, an aviation company based in Cheltenham.

The sooner the programme and presenter are dropped, the better.I can’t wait to see the BBC privatised and the licence fee eliminated.No sane person still believes the BBC is impartial as I am sure we will shortly find when the Brexit extension or another referendum campaign starts shortly.The Conservatives largely have themselves to blame for continuing to allow left-wing figures to dominate senior positions in public sector organisations.It\u0027s so sad, that we see this level of unprofessional polemic described as \u0027savage journalism\u0027 by one Maitlis admirer. I\u0027m a BBC supporter but they are going to be \u0027cut loose\u0027 soon and it\u0027ll be their own darned fault.During the 2016 referendum campaign the BBC was scrupulously fair. Once the result came in, however, all bets were off. Dimbleby’s ashen face appeared to be a signal to anyone at the BBC to begin working against the result.Maitlis’s intemperate and incautious monologue was emblematic of that tendency.More evidence, as if we needed it, that this row is nothing to do with lockdown rules, but everything to do with Brexit.And the BBC is lapping it up. Shame on them.Over a year ago, when the BBC\u0027s anti-Brexit prejudice became too much, we cancelled our licence fee and registered as listed non-payers.Signing up to this register and cutting the coax in the wall meant we could only watch non-live broadcast content, including Amazon Prime movies or Now TV.  Reading of this latest Orwellian atrocity makes it all seem worthwhile.I have remnants of nostalgia for the once world-renowned BBC. The days of Frost, Day, Walden. The superb drama and documentaries. The informative and thought-provoking news items.But, sadly, those days are gone.Ms Maitlis is fully entitled to her views, and in this country, thank goodness, the ability to express them freely. There are multiple organs of communication where she can do so freely and openly.However the BBC as a publicly funded broadcaster is not one of those communication vehicles. Ms Maitlis is unquestionably a good journalist with a commendable track record in investigative reporting. The BBC management and editorial team are well aware of this. The anger directed at her is understandable (especially the hypocrisy of her position on this and Cummings), but it is the editorial team that should shoulder the blame. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korea brings back social distancing measures coronavirus","story":"South Korea on Thursday was forced to beef up its social distancing measures again after the highest spike in coronavirus case in almost two months and warnings from health officials that the surge risked erasing some of the country\u0027s hard-won gains against the pandemic. The announcement came as the Korea Centres for Disease Control (KCDC) reported 79 new cases of Covid-19, with 69 of them linked to a distribution facility owned by Coupang, the country’s leading e-commerce giant, located in Bucheon, west of the capital, Seoul. The tally is feared to increase as thousands of workers and their contacts are tested for the virus, and health officials have cautioned that the country’s much-lauded contact-tracing scheme is being increasingly stretched by new clusters. Following an emergency government meeting, public facilities in Seoul such as parks, museums and art galleries will be closed for the next two weeks. Companies have been urged to adopt more flexible working practices and the staged reopening of schools is now under threat. If we fail to eradicate the spread of the virus in the metropolitan area at an early stage, it will lead to more community infections, eventually undermining school reopenings, Park Neung-hoo, the health minister, said in a press briefing reported by Yonhap. South Korea has never adopted the draconian lockdowns seen in China, but it did enforce a strict social distancing campaign that was enforced between March 22 and May 5. On May 6, it introduced a scheme called everyday life quarantine which gave public facilities and business establishments the leeway to reopen on condition of following basic sanitation measures.However, the country faced a serious setback earlier this month after a cluster that emerged in the capital’s Itaewon nightclub district triggered a new round of infections. To date, 261 new cases have been linked to Itaewon clubs and bars. Entertainment venues in Seoul have been strongly advised to close down over the next two weeks. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the KCDC director, said the country may need to step up its restrictions again as it had become increasingly difficult for health workers to track transmissions amid increasing public activity.“We will do our best to trace contacts and implement preventive measures, but there’s a limit to such efforts,” she said. “There’s a need to maximise social distancing in areas where the virus is circulating, to force people to avoid public facilities and other crowded spaces.”The new clusters of infections have made schools jittery and hundreds have chosen not to reopen.  All 251 schools in Bucheon have been closed and the authorities in Incheon, another city bordering the capital, have also suspended the reopening of 243 schools. Nationwide, 838, or 4 per cent of the total 20,902 schools, have not yet welcomed students back. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel restrictions air bridges could place end june","story":"The Prime Minister has given fresh hope that British holidaymakers could travel overseas this summerWhen can we go on holiday again?

Our expert on the ground, Fiona Flores-Watson, popped out for dinner:Yesterday I ventured out for dinner on the Alameda, a tree-lined avenue in the north-west of the historic centre crammed with places to sup, sip and take a spin on the dancefloor, as well as children’s play areas. This was my first trip in two months into the city centre previous excursions had been limited to local supermarkets, vet and chemist, but no alfresco glasses of wine or tapas, two of the things which make life worth living here in southern Spain.Use of masks is obligatory if you’re within two metres of people outdoors and in indoor public spaces. Arriving in the centre, I could see that less than half of the Seville residents had their noses and mouths covered, although under the minimum distance from each other. The Alameda wasn’t as busy as usual, but still had its customary relaxed, friendly vibe with dogs, families, the young and the young-at-heart. Things are reopening in Seville, after months of lockdownRead the full article here.A new survey, commissioned by Timetastic, of 2002 full-time workers in the UK has shown that the majority have no interest in travelling overseas for the foreseeable future, and instead are eyeing up domestic holidays.How are you feeling about taking a holiday in 2020?

In a statement, he said:“As we begin to reopen our doors across the city, we are proud to help reinvigorate travel to Las Vegas while supporting airlines in America impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. We can’t wait to safely bring visitors to the city and remind them why we’ve earned the title of ‘Entertainment Capital of the World.’ And while we’d love for visitors to stop by Downtown Las Vegas, we primarily want to get people back to Las Vegas to experience the attractions and amenities that make it one of the greatest places on Earth.”Here\u0027s a glimpse of what Vegas will look like when it reopens.This was meant to be the year of Airbnb. Not only was it one of the most anticipated public floats of 2020, its ever expanding portfolio of properties showed no sign of slowing down. That is, until coronavirus hit, and many were forced to cancel their travel plans due to the global shutdown.But as countries around the world show signs of loosening restrictions, many fans of the platform will be wondering when it will be possible to book again.Non-essential bookings are banned until May 31, but it\u0026#39s likely to continue until July 4Unless the government issues an exception for private rentals within the UK, Airbnb will likely keep non-essential UK bookings banned until July 4.

Plenty, I’d argue. Even now, when pubs and restaurants are off the cards and parks are still just about the only place we can enjoy freedom. It may be an unpopular opinion but ask yourself honestly: do you really enjoy picnics, or does (socially distanced) peer pressure propel you to partake?There are at least 18 reasons why picnics are in fact terrible, she argues.

So far, the Males has recorded five deaths and 1,457 cases, the majority in the densely-packed capital of Malé. It was also suggested that well-heeled travellers arriving by yacht or private jet will be allowed to reenter the Males from June 1, with commercial flights restarting from July 1.

We shouldn’t waste the chance to start again from scratch,” said Matteo Secchi from Venessia, a pressure group that campaigns to protect the city’s identity and stem the flow of residents from the centre.Usually packed with tourists, the Rialto Bridge has been empty during lockdownIn 2008 the group installed a digital counter in a shop window near the Rialto Bridge so that Venetians could witness their exodus. At the counter\u0027s launch residents in the historical centre numbered 60,720. Now it is less than 53,000. Secchi added:“We inherited an engineering miracle on a par with the Pyramids at Giza or China’s Great Wall,” says Secchi. Tourism is a precious resource that we have wasted. My hope is that the typical Venetian businesses – the artisans, ateliers and traditional boat builders that have survived the overtourism of the past years – will finally have their day and that visitors might find an authentic Venice – not an anonymous bland bazaar.”Read the full article here.EasyJet will axe up to 4,500 jobs and slash capacity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, writes Simon Foy.The airline will cut staff numbers by up to 30pc as it reduces the size of its fleet to cope with lower passenger demand. EasyJet employs about 15,000 staff, according to its 2019 annual report.

The MacBook Air was the last to gain a Retina Display in late 2018.But there was one key ingredient which wasn’t working quite as well as it should have been for many users: the keyboard. A few years back, Apple switched its keyboard mechanism from scissor-switch to butterfly. That previous scissor-switch keyboard was widely seen as the best QWERTY ever touched, so the butterfly had a tough act to follow. It was designed the way it was because it meant it could fit into smaller spaces, making the laptop potentially thinner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut it proved disappointing. Keys would stick or not register and Apple had to issue extended warranties just for the keyboard. When it worked, the butterfly was effective and pleasant to use, though it didn’t have quite the key travel of the previous system, and it lacked reliability.So, the arrival of the new scissor-switch Magic Keyboard in the 16in MacBook Pro last autumn was greeted with heightened anticipation. Greater key travel, more precision and stability of movement were promised, alongside better backlighting and a gently adjusted key layout.Apple update changes how MacBooks charge to make them live longerAnd the result? An out-and-out success. I’ve been comparing the experience across the older scissor-switch, the butterfly and the new Magic Keyboard, which has now arrived on the new 13in MacBook Pro. Even the older scissor-switch, though still deeply appealing and enjoyable to use, isn’t quite as good as this new one. The new keys have almost the same travel as the classic keyboard (1mm on the new keys, against 1.2mm on the older version). But while the travel is easily enough, this keyboard adds a stability and precision which the earlier version didn’t match.I’d say it’s the best keyboard I’ve ever used. Smooth, comfortable, with subtle shaping to the keys that lets your fingers find them more easily all making for a brilliant experience. On its own, it’s a compelling reason to buy the new MacBook Pro. Not because Apple has fixed a problem but because it’s created something extraordinary.There are several models of the new MacBook Pro 13in. The entry-level models have two USB-C sockets while the higher-level model has four.The most affordable one (£1,299) has the same processor as the previous MacBook Pro 13in, meaning it’s really just a keyboard upgrade. Since the price is the same as the model it replaces, this is still a significant improvement. Actually, there’s another change which is also important, given the fact that the price is the same: the storage in the entry-level model has just doubled from 128GB to 256GB. The next model up also has the same price, same processor as before but comes with the Magic Keyboard and storage which has doubled from its previous 256GB to 512GB.The four-port higher-end model is quite a lot more expensive but it is faster and more powerful.Those extra ports sound negligible but they’re not. Since you can charge your MacBook Pro from any of the four USB-C Thunderbolt 3 sockets, there’s significant extra convenience to be able to plug in on either side, while still having room for three other accessories.Then there are the MacBook Pro features which carry over from last year’s models but set Apple ahead of the rest of the industry. These are details such as the trackpad which is huge and more responsive than pretty much all the competition. There’s the useful fingerprint sensor in the power button which is secure and makes unlocking the MacBook Pro an intimate experience. It can also be used for online purchases, with the fingerprint recognition authorising payments. Then there’s the high-resolution display that looks fantastic, rich and colourful, with neat extras like True Tone which cleverly monitors the ambient light in the room and adjusts the colour temperature onscreen so what you see is faithful to what you should be seeing.The MacBook Pro has the Touch Bar, a touchscreen strip which replaces the function keys and changes its capabilities the instant you change apps. So, in word processing, there are touch-sensitive shortcuts to add formatting, paste something or change the text colour, all without removing your fingers from the keys. Click on to a web browser and the bar immediately changes so that you can see a thumbnail row of previous web pages which you quickly flick between. At all times, functions like muting the speakers or adjusting the brightness are also available, not to mention Siri, the voice assistant, who can be alerted by tapping the icon or simply saying, “Hey, Siri’.But, of course, the main reason to spend £1,799 is the significant uptick in power, especially in graphics power which comes from the tenth-generation Intel chip on board, something that not even the recent 16in MacBook Pro can boast. Mind you, the graphics on the 16in MacBook Pro are still more powerful.If you don’t use apps like video editing, for instance, or other apps with graphic-heavy demands, then the more affordable Pro may suit.Even if you don’t need to edit video, the speed of the MacBook Pro is evident in every action. This is a fast, responsive machine that never dawdles.Virgin Australia bans all Apple MacBooks from checked-in luggageApple MacBook Air Review: The upgrade users have been aching forOverall, the MacBook Pro 13in, in either two-port or four-port version, is likely capable enough for all your needs, but still small enough to throw into a bag easily (and the popularity of the size is one reason why Apple didn’t enlarge the screen to 14 inches, in the way the 15-inch MacBook Pro has just swelled to a 16-inch display).Spare a thought, though, for the MacBook Air, a less expensive laptop (from £999) that does almost as much as the entry-level MacBook Pro 13in. Much of  the standout tech from the Pro is also found on the Air, such as the Magic Keyboard, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, the large trackpad, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and the 13in screen size.The Pro display goes brighter, has wide colour instead of the standard colour on the Air. Again, these are details that Pro users need and the rest of us merely enjoy. There’s no Touch Bar on the Air, please note. But the Air is lighter than the Pro, as its name suggests it should be, and it even has battery life a touch longer than the Pro. Though in my experience, battery life is extremely good on all these models. Overall, it makes the MacBook Air a compelling purchase as well, beating the Pro if your needs are not as heavy, though both the entry-level and higher-end MacBook Pro offer more in the way of power, for sure. Really, if the only upgrade to the new MacBook Pro had been the new keyboard, it would make it a great purchase, since the price on both the new models is identical to the last ones. But, for those wanting more power, the four-port MacBook Pro with tenth-generation Intel processor, is a perfect balance of portability and powerBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As they do, the amount of charge they can hold drops, until they eventually become so short their life is over.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe new feature aims to slow down the rate at which that ageing process happens. It does so by watching how hot it gets and when it tends to be charged.The feature is switched on by default and arrives in the latest update, which is numbered macOS 10.15.5. That update may download automatically, and may already have installed itself on many MacBooks.Apple announces next major event with iPhone and Mac updatesAs it gathers data about how the computer is used, the feature could stop the laptop charging all the way up. By doing so, it reduces strain on the battery by avoiding filling up with charge when that power would not necessarily be needed straight away.As such, the feature could leave some Macs with less charge than might normally be expected. Apple allows users to turn the feature off if they need to ensure they have full charge on their computer.A similar tool is already present in iOS for the iPhone and iPad, where it can also be switched off.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

If it has water and oxygen, it could potentially be home to\u0026nbspalien lifeA planet the size of Earth has been confirmed around the closest star in our solar system, Proxima Centauri, by an international team of scientists.The planet, called ‘Proxima b’, has a mass of 1.17 Earths and is located in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, which the planet orbits approximately every 11 days, according to the new paper published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics.The first indications of the planet’s existence were in 2013 by Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire from archival observation data, with continued research following in 2016. It is believed this planet could be “likely” to be able to support alien life forms.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers detected this planet by measuring radial velocity using the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) which is installed on a telescope in Chile. It is three times as accurate as HARPS, another spectrograph which has been used to measure the velocity of Proxima Centauri.Radial velocity, in relation to a given point, is the rate of change of the distance between an object and that point. As a planet orbits a star, its gravitational pull causes a star to move back and forth. This tiny motion shifts the observed light spectrum of the star slightly due to Doppler shift, which can be detected with sensitive instruments.Everything you need to know about SpaceX launchA low disturbance in Proxima Centauri’s speed, detected by ESPRESSO, tipped researchers off to the presence of the planet. Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Michel Mayor said that ESPRESSO makes it possible to “measure the mass of the planet with a precision of over one-tenth of the mass of Earth”, which he describes as “completely unheard of.Proxima Centauri is approximately 4.2 light-years from the Sun, but Nasa estimates it would take approximately 73,000 years for us to reach the planet unless new technologies are developed.Ionic propulsion, nuclear thermal propulsion, nuclear pulse propulsion, fusion rockets, and laser sails have all been considered as methods to travel to the planet.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzle30 years of space wonder began with a vital but underwhelming imageSpace Force launch: Robotic rocket plane blasts off on secret missionAstronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutes“We were already very happy with the performance of HARPS, which has been responsible for discovering hundreds of exoplanets over the last 17 years,” said Francesco Pepe, a professor in the Astronomy Department in UNIGE’s Faculty of Science in a statement. “We’re really pleased that ESPRESSO can produce even better measurements, and it’s gratifying and just reward for the teamwork lasting nearly 10 years.”Alejandro Suarez Mascareño, the article’s main author, said: “Confirming the existence of Proxima b was an important task, and it’s one of the most interesting planets known in the solar neighbourhood.”Although Proxima b is about 20 times closer to its star than the Earth is to the Sun, it receives comparable amounts of energy. If there is liquid form on the planet, it could harbour life, but researchers said there is still much to be done before that can be confirmed. “Is there an atmosphere that protects the planet from these deadly rays?” said Christophe Lovis, a researcher in the University of Geneva’s Astronomy Department, “and if this atmosphere exists, does it contain the chemical elements that promote the development of life?”It is also possible that there could be a second planet orbiting the star, as the research team found evidence of a second signal in the data – but was unable to determine its origins. “If the signal was planetary in origin, this potential other planet accompanying Proxima b would have a mass less than one third of the mass of the Earth. It would then be the smallest planet ever measured using the radial velocity method,” said Professor Pepe.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The four-part documentary features the testimonies of multiple survivors who say they were abused by the disgraced financier.Its first episode focuses in part on an investigation conducted in 2011 by journalist Vicky Ward for Vanity Fair.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to Ward, Epstein became threatening when he found out Ward was working on a piece about him, telling her that if he didn’t “like” it, “it’s going to be bad for you and your family”.19 best limited series for TV commitment-phobesThe best Amazon Prime and Netflix shows to watch while self-isolatingNetflix to automatically cancel ‘hundreds of thousands’ of accountsJeffrey Epstein: Netflix documentary brings to light new allegationsThe journalist goes on to recall a phone call from Carter, in which she says he shared additional concerning news.“He was pretty spooked because he’d found a severed cat head in his garden,” Ward says.“He also found a bullet on his doorstep.”Ward goes on to state that part of her story with testimony from two women who shared allegations against Epstein were ultimately taken out, which she attributed to an editorial decision on the magazine’s part.Carter disputed Ward’s recollection in a statement provided to the documentary and said that parts of Ward’s reporting “did not meet our legal threshold” at the time.

The A Star is Born actor shared images of herself in a Chromatica branded vehicle under the caption: “Delivering Chromatica myself to every retailer around the world. In Chromatica time and distance do not exist.” Fans have speculated the move is an attempt to prevent a person working for a delivery company from leaking the album online.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Chromatica’s tracklist appeared on Target’s website. Though it was quickly taken down, it was quickly discovered and spread across the internet. The singer posted the entire tracklist the same day that the information leaked — presumably because there was no chance of keeping it under wraps any more — confirming that Ariana Grande, Blackpink, and Elton John will all make appearances.Tim Burgess on the brilliant Dexys Midnight Runners album, Too-Rye-AyHow Desperate Housewives blazed a trail for Little Fires EverywhereMatthew Perry gave Lisa Kudrow the cookie time jar from FriendsOthers think the decision to hand-deliver copies of Chromatica is just a joke about bending the laws of time and space. Delivery company FedEx have been roped into the publicity stunt after a fan posted a fake complaint against Gaga’s delivery service on Twitter.“@FedExHelp this woman almost hit me while driving down my block delivering packages for you,” wrote the fan. “I wrote her plates down just in time.. it read “PSSYWGN” please do something immediately.”A spokesperson for FedEx replied: “Hello, this is Lisa.  I’m sorry to hear of this incident.  Please DM as much information as possible. Name, address, phone number, email address, truck number, and if it was a FedEx Express, Ground, or Home Delivery truck so that I can report this to the appropriate station.”Chromatica will be released this Friday (29 May).The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A new launch time of 3.22pm (8.22pm UK time) has been scheduled for Saturday from Nasa\u0027s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWeather permitting, it won\u0027t just be those on the east coast of the US that will be able to see the launch. The trajectory of the Crew Dragon capsule means sky gazers in the UK will also be able to view the space craft as it passes overhead.It will look like any other satellite does – a spot moving across the sky in 5 minutes, astrophysicist Dr Darren Baskill, who lectures at the University of Sussex, told The Independent.Everything you need to know about SpaceX launchBecause the spaceship is small, it will be faint – so fine to see with the unaided eyes, but nowhere near as bright as the football-field sized International Space Station. Also, it will be low in the sky, so best seen from the South and the midlands, with a clear southern horizon.The first pass of the spacecraft will take place shortly after take-off, but it will be too light to see in the skies above the UK.A second pass at around 10.15pm will be visible to anyone facing south-west with a clear view of the horizon, so long as the skies stay clear.Several websites offer ways to track the Crew Dragon capsule, as well as the International Space Station (ISS), where it will eventually dock.The site Heavens Above gives specific details about the Crew Dragon craft, while a tool developed by the European Space Agency allows real-time tracking of the ISS.Live streams of the launch will also be hosted on the official Nasa and SpaceX YouTube channels, with close to 2 million people tuning in to the failed first launch.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers found 70 per cent of parents do not have any type of external support in providing care and education for their children.The study, which polled 3,055 working parents in the UK, America, France, Germany, and Italy, found similar gendered patterns in other countries too.Researchers found women with children across these countries now spend an average of 65 hours a week on unpaid labour around the house — with this figure having almost doubled since the Covid-19 crisis. This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But now, those youngsters – who Mr Brent admits “get a bad press” – are helping London’s most vulnerable.AJ is 15.

Each box is packed with goods such as ready meals, fresh fruit, vegetables, tinned goods, nappies, tampons and soap.On the involvement of the young estate volunteers, he said: “They just want to be involved and have been engaged from the start. I did one call for help at the beginning but they keep coming back.“They have been incredible and are true stars. Some people are desperate and get aggressive.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Piers Morgan has accused the BBC of throwing Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis “under the bus” after the corporation ruled an introduction she gave on Tuesday’s programme breached impartiality guidelines.The Good Morning Britain host tweeted in outrage at the BBC’s statement regarding its decision, calling the broadcaster “utterly disgraceful”.Mr Morgan said: “You’ve got to be kidding me??? BBC chucking one of its best journalists @maitlis under the bus for TELLING THE TRUTH? Utter disgraceful.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Maitlis had received praise from some viewers for her opening to the show, in which she said that Boris Johnson’s top advisor Dominic Cummings had broken the rules of lockdown and added: “The country can see that, and it’s shocked the government cannot.”She said in a 90-second monologue: “The disease is not a great leveller, the consequences of which everyone – rich or poor – suffers the same. This is a myth which needs debunking.”BBC apologises after presenter calls Dominic Cummings a ‘d***\u0027 on airEmily Maitlis ‘asked for night off’ from BBC NewsnightBBC says comments about Cummings ‘did not meet impartiality standards’Emily Maitlis praised for summing up Dominic Cummings row On Wednesday, the BBC said in a statement that staff had been “reminded of the guidelines around impartiality. Ms Maitlis was replaced by Katie Razzall for the next episode of Newsnight, a decision that sparked more anger among those who were in support of her monologue.“We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality.”Mr Morgan, who has been vocal in his disapproval of Mr Cummings’ actions, also took aim at other “high profile BBC stars” for not speaking out against the BBC’s decision.“Cat got your cowardly tongues? If you don’t stand firm with her speaking the truth about a lying hypocrite whose reckless disregard of his own rules will cost lives, it will be you next,” he warned in another tweet. “Speak up!”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Michael Anthony Gray Sr., aged 63, and Shirley Ann Gray, aged 60, were charged on Monday with multiple crimes including child abuse, child neglect, kidnapping and abuse of a corpse.Investigators say the couple had confined their daughter to a basement with nothing but bread and water for months, before her death in 2017. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe child’s body, which appeared to have been buried behind the property, was located on Saturday. Authorities believe the child, who Mr Gray admitted was buried when investigators arrived at the home on Friday, was around 10 years old when she died.

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Discarded personal protective equipment (PPE) has been found at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, fuelling concerns over the impact the Covid-19 pandemic is having on the environment.In a video shared online, several pairs of latex gloves, surgical masks and other face coverings can be seen strewn along the ocean floor near the coast of Cannes, France.Activist Laurent Lombard recorded the clip while ing near Antibes, about 6 miles east of Cannes on the French Riviera.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt has since been uploaded to the Facebook page of the Clean Sea Operation where it has been viewed almost 200,000 times, sparking anger among commentators.“Soon there will be more masks than jellyfish in the waters of the Mediterranean…!” Mr Lombard wrote in a caption accompanying the video.Plastic pollution: Why we’re failing to cut down“The health crisis has allowed us to see the best and worst in us. If we do nothing, it’s the worst that will happen when it’s simply a matter of common sense to avoid all of this,” he added.Countries across the globe have been ordering millions of pieces of PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic in a bid to help stop the spread of the novel disease.While PPE such as face masks is vital in helping to prevent transmission between medics in hospital, there is little evidence to suggest that they work in the wider community.Environmentalists have pointed out that the use of disposable masks by the wider public is likely to add to the glut of plastic pollution threatening the health of oceans and marine life.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David

addition to the ever-growing marine debris crisis our oceans are facing. “No better, no worse, just shouldn’t be there in the first place.

I can announce our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June  - a week on Monday, he added.We then intend from June  for secondary schools to provide some contact for year  and  students to help them prepare for exams next year.Up to a quarter of older students will attend schools at any one time, the Prime Minister said, adding: Were taking a deliberately cautious approach after a very constructive period of consultation.He said full social distancing may not be possible.However, plans to keep children separate include smaller class sizes, keeping pupils in smaller groups, staggered break and lunchtimes, as well as drop-offs and pick-ups, and increased cleaning.The Department for Education has published detailed guidance on the issue, he added.Progress is conditional and provisional he said, insisting that we must all remember the basics, like washing hands and maintaining social distancing.We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the fasterwe stay alert, control the virus and save lives, he said.What we will do is make sure that we stagger things and we pace things and we work directly with you, with local authorities, to make sure that there is a plan, he said.Teaching unions are opposed to the Governments plan to re-open schools on June , claiming teachers, pupils and their families will be at risk of catching the deadly virus.The National Education Union slammed the school plan as reckless and warned infection rates were still too high.The union advised members to tell headteachers they were “[awaiting] further advice from [their] union”.More than , schools have now refused to open on June .Some local authorities, especially in the north of England, have advised their schools to stay closed on that date.Doctors also said it was too risky to reopen schools on June  - however The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, has since dropped its hardline opposition to reopening.Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientic adviser, said an effective track and trace system was needed to isolate those infected by the coronavirus before changes were made to lockdown rules.She told The Times that this should be based on observed levels of infection . . . and not on a fixed date.And scientist John Edmunds, another member of Sage, told Sky News that a track and trace system must be embedded and working well before schools reopened.An exclusive investigation by The Sun revealed at least  councils have warned schools under their control could stay shut.Analysis by The Sun found the local authorities cover , primaries.The best way to checkyour school will be open is to stay in contact with them directly by checking their website.Reception, year one and year six are set to be the first year groups toto schools after June .The Department for Education issued guidelines on May  on how schools should enforce social distancing - including limiting class sizes to  students.The main points areBut union boss Kevin Courtney tweeted on May : Education unions intend to work together.Dont engage with planning a June stto wider opening - await further union advice.Meanwhile, General Secretary of The National Association for Head Teachers Paul Whiteman told the Education Select Committee: If social distancing is as we understand it now - the two metre rule to be applied in schools - there are very many schools that are saying it is simply impossible to achieve.He said making sure younger year groups stay at least two metres apart from each other and their teachers and practice good hygiene such as hand washing will be particularly dficult. Schools have been closed since March  - three days before the Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown.Schools are told to stagger lunch and break times, as well as drop-off and pick-up times, to reduce the number of pupils moving around at once.It also said schools should look at bringing in a one-way system in corridors, or putting a ider in the middle to control the flow of kids.Institutions are advised to remove all soft toys or any toys that are hard to clean.Ministers admitted they cannot keep kids two metres away from each other all day, so each class will form a self-contained bubble so they dont mix with other kids at the schools.For secondary schools and colleges, classes will be halved, the government said.That means that classrooms and workshops will be rearranged with sitting positions two metres apart.Where very small classes might result from halving, it would be acceptable to have more than half in a class, provided the space has been rearranged.Support staff may be drawn on in the event there are teacher shortages, the advice added.Williamson saidscientic advice proposed a limited number of children could be sent back to school, it was his duty to allow this to happen.No has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.A spokesman for No said: While we will not penalise [parents] for keeping children at home, once children are eligible toto school we will strongly encourage them to do so.Dr Bousted urged the Government to meet tests set out by unions, which includes extra money for deep cleaning and personal protective equipment and local powers to close schoolsclusters of infections break out.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on May  it was completely natural for parents to worry about sending their kids back to school.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again. Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus. And then he discovered the laws of gravity.Oh, and formulated a theory of light which dominated science for the next century and beyond. All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France. Good for her.Since the turn of the year more than , illegal immigrants have arrived on our shores from our neighbours.Brexit Britain is an even more popular destination than it was before we left the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than a third said they would bring the majority of their furloughed workers back part-time from August.Mr Sunak has already announced that employers will be able to furlough staff part-time, but has yet to announce details of how this will work.Jonathan Geldart, boss of the IoD, said: The furlough scheme is protecting millions of jobs. Business leaders know that the Governments support cant be infinite, but the ugly truth is thattheres no money coming in the door, many firms will be forced to make dficult decisions come August.Directors will be fighting tooth and nail to avoid this scenario. There is hope that as more areas of the economyto work, more companies can keep people on board.However, despite best efforts, many firms simply wont be able to work at full capacity for the foreseeable future and theres no magic wand to lt demand back up again.The Government must soften the blow by introducing as much flexibility as possible into the furlough system. The more flexible the scheme is, the better firms can recover, and the fewer jobs will rely on state subsidy.With the prospect of job losses and businesses struggling to create new roles in the months ahead, the spotlight will be on our training system.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On  April , Mr Cummings drove approximately  miles from his father’s property to Barnard Castle with his we and son. He stated on  May  that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castleand have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the Regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings toto the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.In line with Durham Constabulary’s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings dferently from other members of the public.Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on  April . Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

not just at that time point but around it -  per cent had symptoms, so  per cent didnt.Based on the results of people tested since the start of the study, which began on April , the ONS estimates that there were . new infections per  people for one week.This is equivalent to an average of , positive cases per week for people living in private-residential households in England.The ONS said that the change in this figure compared with the results from the survey published last week is relatively small.It should be interpreted that the number of new infections in England is relatively stable, the ONS said.The ONS survey also found . per cent of  people tested had developed antibodies to the bug in their blood.People were asked whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms on the day they were tested.Over the course of the study, almost three per cent who said they had experienced one or more symptoms of Covid- tested positive.The percentage of people testing positive for Covid- was higher for those who reported specically having a cough or fever, or loss of taste or smell on the day of testing than for any other symptom.Of those reporting these specic symptoms, . per cent also tested positive for the bug.This compares with an estimate of . per cent of those who did not have the three key coronavirus symptoms.The ONS said it continues to find no evidence of dferences in the proportions of men or women testing positive for Covid-.But it did find there were stark dferences when it came to whether people were working at home or roles out in the community.Patient-facing healthcare workers and resident-facing social care workers were found to have higher rates of positive tests than people not working in these roles.While those working outside the home had higher rates of positive tests than those who work from home, the data found.It also revealed that while those who have symptoms are more likely to test positive than those without symptoms, out of those within the study who have ever tested positive for Covid-,  per cent reported any symptoms on the day of testing.The analysis was produced by the ONS in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

after being at alert level  for two months.Boris Johnson revealed this evening:In a call with the First Ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Mr Johnson made clear relaxing lockdown is a UK-wide approach evendferent areas may travel at slightly dferent speeds.A Downing street spokesman said:stressed the importance of particularly close engagement on programmes that must be UK-wide to be most effective.“ agreed that continued engagement is vital and that they will remain in close contact in the days and weeks ahead.”People in England are now able to meet up to six other people from dferent households in outdoor spaces and private gardens - and they are allowed to go through peoples homes to get to gardens and use their toilets.Ms Sturgeon warned Scots today they could see people in groups of up to eight - but only two households could see one another.She also said they should not use each others toilets and to be mindful of that when travelling to see people.In Wales, people are not allowed to meet up with other households.In Northern Ireland groups of four to six people who are not part of the same household can gather outdoors as long as they are socially distanced.In England, people have been allowed to spend an unlimited amount of time outdoors for the last three weeks.They have been allowed to have picnics, sunbathe and travel to beauty spots and beaches - no matter how far away they have been.Scotland and Wales both kept stay-at-home orders in place as the PM moved to the Stay Alert messaging.That was relaxed somewhat in Scotland today - people can spend leisure time outdoors, but should stay local, within a  mile radius of their home.Ms Sturgeon urged people not to travel to beauty spots and tourist destinations eventhey were nearby, because of the risk of crowds spreading coronavirus.People in Wales can exercise more than once a day - but non-essential travel is still banned.Schools in England will reopen for pupils in reception, year one and year six from Monday June .Class sizes will be limited to  pupils and strict social distancing measures will be introduced in classrooms.All Scottish students willto classrooms on August , with a mix of home learning and in-school teaching to make sure there arent too many people in schools.Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he does want to get some kids back in classrooms before the summer break - but that they wont open on June .Northern Ireland has pushed the schools reopening date back even further - with a phased reopening in August or September.All non-essential retail has remained closed throughout the United Kingdom.Gardens centres are now open in England and Northern Ireland.They will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from next week.From June , non-essential retail in England will be allowed to reopen the Prime Minister announced today.All shops will have to have strict social distancing measures and rules over how many customers per store. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month.

But the official advice suggests that some people might prefer to use their holiday entitlement to cover the time at home. The official guidance reads: If people can’t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave daysthey prefer. There are fears that many workers will not be able to afford to isolate becuse statutory sick pay is just £ a week and millions of workers are not eligible for it. TUC general secretary Frances OaposGrady said: We need a testing and tracing programme up and running as soon as possible. But it will not be effectiveworkers are pushed into hardship when they are required to self-isolate. Statutory sick pay is just £ per week - and two million workers arenapost even eligible for that. If workers canapost afford to self-isolate, then they will be forced to keep working. That will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire Test and Trace programme.  The Government must extend statutory sick pay to everyone - no matter what theyaposre paid - and raise it to the level of the real Living Wage, £ per week. And the self-employed income support scheme must remain in place as a source of financial support for those forced to self-isolate. Thataposs how to show that we really are all in this together. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for enhanced sick pay when he was asked about the new system and people being expected to self-isolate for  dayscontacted.

A spokeswoman for the DWP said: This Government has provided an unprecedented package of support to help people through this pandemic including injecting £. billion into the welfare system, rolling out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters. Weaposve made sick pay more generous by starting it from day one and will refund employers with up to  staff the cost of up to two weeksapos sick pay.  Employers can, and many do, pay more than the statutory rate - something we encourage. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the Government must ensure people do not face a sudden drop in incomethey have to self-isolate under the Test and Trace system. She said: Problems with our system for sick pay are long-standing. Even for those eligible for statutory sick pay, it may not be enough to cover essential living costs. The Government must look to extend statutory sick pay to those who arenapost currently eligible. People need enough to live on so they can self-isolateasked to without fear of being pushed into hardship.

Labouraposs Rosena Allin-Khan said Mr Hancockaposs reaction was an insult to the , people who have died of Covid- - saying the need for a working test and trace system is not a joke. NHS Test and Trace will officially launch across England today with the help of , contact tracers, although an accompanying app is still delayed by several weeks. But today NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson warned very key bits of the Governmentaposs test and trace strategy are not yet in place. Mr Hancock originally said the NHSX contact tracing app would be an integral part of the system - but that has been delayed following a trial on the Isle of Wight. But Ms Burley challenged him on why Test and Trace has been rolled out now, without the app in place. She said: The problem is youaposve rushed it forward havenapost you  Because you want to take the headlines away from Dominic Cummings. Youaposve brought it forward. It should have been  June, when the app is being launched at the same time.  Mr Hancock said: Itaposs priceless, Kay. Iaposm normally accused of delaying these things, bringing them in too slowly. Itaposs, I, I committed to getting this in mid-May...itaposs just about mid-May. You canapost accuse me both of... Ms Burley interrupted: OK, you talked about the app in mid-May, didnapost you, Health Secretary, and weaposve still not got that app. Mr Hancock started to laugh loudly. You said the app was absolutely essential to this track and trace, she said. The app is still not ready until next week at the earliest. Maybe after that. Yet youaposve brought this forward. I suppose many of my viewers will think itaposs not a laughing matter. Mr Hancock said: Yes, well. I canapost quite work out whether youaposre telling me that Iaposve gone too slow or too fast. I think weaposve gone at just the right speed. Ms Burley said: I tell you what, I donapost think my viewers know. I think theyaposre as confused as I am. Clary it for us. Mr Hancock said the app was helpful and was working on the Isle of Wight. He added: But thereaposs a reason we havenapost brought it in right at the start, which is that asking people to isolate, eventheyaposre healthy, because the NHS has got in contact and informed them that they are in higher risk because theyaposve been in contact with somebody who has tested positive, that is quite a big change. One of the things we learnt in the pilot on the Isle of Wight was that getting people used to that idea is important to do before we then also add the technological capability, the app, on top.  Rosena Allin-Khan said: What an insult. At least , people have died of Covid- in the UK. [The Government] abandoned community testing. With a proper test and trace system in place months ago, thousands would have been saved. This is not a joke. This has been painful for so many families. NHS Providers Chief Chris Hopson told the BBC: Weaposre in the process of building test and trace. There will be a group of contact tracers who will be readymorning but there are still very key bits of test and trace that still need to be built. Mr Hopson said the speed of testing needed to be improved, comparing international standards of having tests back within  hours with reports of tests taking up to three to five days, as well as referencing the need to provide support locally.

Seven out of  people want Downing Street lackey Dominic Cummings sacked after flagrantly breaching “stay at home” rules. They’re right, but they don’t go far enough. The real villain is not dastardly Dom. It is Boris Johnson. He put political and class loyalty to his Svengali “special adviser” ahead of the national interest. He has presided over the most chaotic, least successful, campaign against coronavirus in Europe. He scrapped test-and-trace in mid-March, and undermined the policy even before it restarted, confusing the population with mixed messages. Forget the monkey. It’s the organ grinder who is the guilty man. The Prime Minister should go, and take his numpty Cabinet accomplices with him. Weeks ago, I called them second rate. I was wrong. They’re fourth rate. It will not happen, of course, because boastful Bojo is sitting on a big Commons majority and political turkeys – not even wattle-quivering Tory MPs – do not vote for Christmas.

Troy House in Monmouth, which dates back to the th century had a guide price of £, - but a last-minute bidding war saw the cost swell to more than six times that figure. As well as the huge number of bedrooms, it also boasts a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. But bargain hunters had earlier been warned that it would need extensive refurbishment - with shocking pictures showing the level to which it had deteriorated. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, but was later converted into a school.  Listed by  Allsop, the property has  bedrooms, four dormitories, a principalaposs flat, a staff flat, a caretakeraposs flat, a two storey hostel block, outbuildings and garages.The picturesque setting and grand exterior belie the true scale of the renovation job required, with photos of the interior showing floorboards and structures rotten through, with a huge clearance job needed to clear the abandoned school furniture. The description reads: The property is presented in a poor state of repair and requires extensive works of modernisation and refurbishment. The property may afford possible potential for redevelopment and or a number of alternative uses, subject to obtaining all necessary consents. Itaposs located a short journey from the historic market town of Monmouth, with both Cardf and Bristol city centres also accessible.Richard Adamson, partner and auctioneer at Allsop, said before the auction: Troy House has received a signicant amount of interest with over  enquiries regarding the property, in just over a week of coming to the market. We have seen a mixed-bag of interest from people who could use the property for multiple uses including as a private home, converting into a boutique hotel and spa, or refurbished into luxury apartments, subject to planning.

Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association , warned however thatthe two-metre guidance remains, just one-third could reopen their doors. She said the industry would then face further financial misery and ruin. Miss McClarkin, whose organisation represents about , UK pubs and the majority of brewers, said the required distance should be reduced to at least one metre, as in several European countries and advised by the World Health Organisation . But she said weaposre not asking unless itaposs safe to do. The struggling hospitality sector was given a flicker of hope after Boris Johnson hinted on Wednesday that restaurants, hotels and bars could potentially reopen earlier than planned after he asked scientists to review the two-metre rule.Miss McClarkin said: Weaposre not asking unless itaposs safe to do. It is an internationally recognised standard of one metre, used in France, Italy and Denmark, which allows some kind of normality. Pubs are currently on a very highly tuned Government le-support machine. The longer they remain on it, and with all the other medicines they have to pay for, some wonapost survive. Once pubs close they are very, very hard to resuscitate. Miss McClarkin said polling of BBPA members showed about % could not survive until Septemberthey remained closed, and the pub sector was burning through roughly £ million in cash every month during lockdown. Under current plans, pubs, hotels and restaurants remain closed until at least July . Miss McClarkin, a former Conservative MEP for the East Midlands region, said polling of members also showed just one-third could re-open under two-metre guidelines, with that figure jumping to more than %it is dropped to one metre.  At the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs the scientic advisory group for emergencieshad been told to review the guidance. He said: My own hope is that as we make progress in getting the virus down, in reducing the incidence, that we will be able to reduce that distance, which I think will be particularly valuable in transport and clearly the hospitality sector. Mr Johnson said advice from Sage remains that there is a very considerable reduction in risk at two metres.  Public Health Englandaposs medical director, Professor Yvonne Doyle, has said the UK took a cautionary approach to introducing the rule when other countries were using shorter distances. She told the Science and Technology Select Committee: We are aware of the international dferences and I am sure this will be the subject of continued investigation as to whether two metres is actually necessary or whether that can be reduced further. Miss McClarkin said bars have spent lockdown assessing how to keep staff and customers safe, looking at deep cleaning regimes and options including limited bar service to reduce transmission.

Just weeks after many parts of England and Wales were deluged with floodwater, the spring drought has seen gardens wilt, farmers fret over parched crops and reservoir levels drop. The Environment Agencysaid on Thursday that most water companies have appropriate reserves, and it stressed its calls for people to use water wisely should not deter anyone from regular hand-washing as part of the fight against Covid-. But it confirmed United Utilities has applied to take water from a Cumbrian lake to help with supplies in the county. It warned further measures may be needed in the north-west of Englandthe dry spell continues.The Met Office is predicting some regions, especially in the south of England, will record the lowest May rainfall figures on record when the final statistics are collated on Monday.But a spokesman for Water UK, the trade association representing water companies, said: There are no plans for any hosepipe bans this summer. It is always worth using water wisely, though, especially at the moment when people are spending more time at home. Taking a few simple steps to save water reduces the stress on the environment and the water network.  An EA spokesman said most companies across the country have appropriate water reserves for this time of year.While dry weather since late March has led to a decline in some reservoirs, this is not unusual during a hot and dry spell, and they can recover quickly when the rain s, they added.The EA said United Utilities, the company which supplies water to the North West, has applied for a drought order to take supplies from Ennerdale Water in the Lake District to sustain supplies in west Cumbria. South East Water has asked its customers to help us by taking simple steps, such as not watering lawns, reusing paddling pool water and only using dishwashers and washing machines on full loads to help make sure there is enough water for everyone.  The firm said it has been pumping an additional  million litres of water a day through its network and water being used on DIY projects and gardening has contributed to an additional % of water use. Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said: May has been exceptionally dry. Some regions are on track to have possibly the driest May on record. Mr Claydon said the official figures for May will be published next week, but they are likely to be record breaking in some regions - especially in the south of England - but not for the UK as a whole. Up to Tuesday, only .mm of rain had fallen on average across the UK, and only mm had fallen on average in England since the beginning of March. Forecasters said there is no appreciable rain expected in the next week, with an area of high pressure sitting to the east set to continue dominating the weather for at least the next week.  Only the far north of Scotland is expected to see some rain early next week. Temperatures peaked at .C at Heathrow Airport on Tuesday. The highest temperature recorded so far this year is .C at Santon Downham, Suffolk, on May . But Mr Claydon said this mark could be broken on Friday somewhere around the Moray Firth, in northern Scotland, where the Foehn Effect will produce exceptionally warm conditions. The Foehn Effect is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the otherside.

From Friday people will be able to meet up with friends and relatives from other households, one household at a time. Scots can also take part in some non-contact sports including golf, angling and outdoor swimming. Garden centres, drive-through restaurants and recycling centres will also be reopened. The First Minister announced that teachers would be allowed to re-enter schools to prepare for the proposedof schools on August . People will also now be allowed to sit and sunbathe in local parks. A legal limit will not be put on how far people will be allowed to travel for recreation but the First Minister said the strong advice of the Scottish Government was to stay within five miles. She added: We simply donapost want, in this phase, large numbers of people at tourist hotspots or beauty spots. Crowds of people, eventheyaposre trying to social distance, bring more risk than we judge is acceptable at this point. The First Minister asked that the number of people together between the two households should not exceed a maximum of eight people, along with asking that meetings do not take place with a dferent household in the same day. She said: I know how much all of you, all of us, will be looking forward to seeing family and friends for the first time in a while, but how we do this will be vital. Before you meet up with people from another household, you should stop, think, read the guidance and make sure youaposre protecting yourself and others.  In particular, you must stay outdoors and stay two metres away from people from the other household - that is crucial. The First Minister told those who had been asked to shield for  weeks due to an underlying health condition that they have not been forgotten, adding that measures were being drawn up to move to less of a blanket approach that reflects the circumstances of the inidual. Ms Sturgeon said her confidence in the move to phase one was boosted by the initiation of the Test and Protect scheme in Scotland, which is aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. Under the scheme, those who are symptomatic will be tested and their contacts traced should they have the virus.  The First Minister also said people will be able to help to stop the spread of the virus by continuing to social distance. She added: Test and Protect will be a crucial part of our efforts to control this virus in the weeks ahead, but it will not do it on its own. The use of face coverings, social distancing and hand washing, the First Minister said, will remain key to tackling the spread of the virus. Ms Sturgeon said that a downward trend in coronavirus cases was sustained and unmistakable.

Temperatures are expected to peak on Sunday with highs of C rivalling the hottest day of the year so far - but June will likely start far less bright and sunny.The Met Office forecasts rain and strong winds for the northern and western parts of the UK especially into next week.While BBC forecasts agree there is some uncertainty as we leave May for what should be the start of the summer - with an area of low pressure likely moving in from the Atlantic and bringing showers. And despite the heat-wave set to continue for now, BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes said there are warning signs that things may be ready to change.Yesterday saw highs of C in the Heathrow area and while Mr Fawkes said Thursday will be warmer in the northwest the sunny weather will not reach everyone.He said overnight two concerning weather fronts were moving in which could dictate the weather in Britain in the coming days.  One coming down the North Sea, a cold front, thataposs going to be introducing cooler air to East Anglia and south east England, dropping temperatures, he said. While another in northern Scotland, is set to bring cloudy weather and outbreaks of rain today. The heaviest of this across the Highlands, into Aberdeenshire, Orkney and Shetland as well, he added.  Mr Fawkes said while the likes of Manchester will see C and Glasgow , itaposs going to feel fresher in London which dips to  degrees. Overnight temperatures into Thursday plummeted C in Norwich compared to the previous day, as that cooler air works in. However, the forecaster added for most Brits, Thursday will see sunshine from dawn til dusk.

The country has seen , more deaths than usual since March , three days before the lockdown was announced. This means the virus has directly or indirectly killed  people per million, analysis by the Financial Times suggests. That is a higher death rate than any other country providing detailed data, including Italy and the US. Italy was the European country hardest hit by the virus in the early stages of the crisis, although the UK and US have subsequently recorded more excess deaths. Despite the US suffering more than , deaths, the highest number of fatalities in the world, its excess death rate is still lower than the UK as it has a population of  million. The data used by the Financial Times was from national statistical organisations in  countries, including all European countries hard hit by coronavirus. These were the only countries for which enough information could be found to make proper comparisons. The actual number of excess deaths in the UK is the highest in Europe, with only the US recording more globally. Peru is the only country that has recorded a higher percentage increase in deaths than the UK since the pandemic started. While countries like China and Russia have suffered many fatalities, the overall death rate is much lower than the UK because of their large populations.

It was deeply insulting. There was no apology for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings. There was no acknowledgement of the anger it caused and no acceptance that it had undermined the Government’s message at a crucial moment in the battle against coronavirus. Calls for an inquiry were swatted away with the arrogance of an oligarch bored of counting his money. The Prime Minister repeatedly claimed the allegations against Cummings were . When asked to substantiate this allegation he declined. Yet as this paper has accurately reported, Cummings did flout the lockdown restrictions, the police did speak to his family and he did make a trip, against the clear instructions, to Barnard Castle. When this defence failed, Mr Johnson resorted to the cheapest trick in the book by accusing anyone asking perfectly legitimate questions of playing party politics. Nobody is playing a game here. There is genuine concern that the public will lose faith in the lockdown measures which could result in a second spike and yet more deaths. On Thursday the Government will roll out its test and trace programme that will require hundreds of thousands of people to self-isolate for  days, whether they are infected or not. Mr Johnson was hesitant to say whether this was compulsory or not – it will, in fact, be voluntary – because he knows he can no longer tell the public what to do when his chief adviser is making the rules up as he goes along.

Led by former music teacher, Marshall Applewhite, whose body was also found among the dead, they believed their deaths were merely a transition. The extreme cult told its followers that following their suicides, they would transcend their earthly bodies, or containers to start a new le on board an alien spacecraft. Applewhite told his believers that the space ship was hiding behind the Hale Bop comet, which was passing the earth at the time of the mass suicide on March , . Harrowing images of the bodies of the Heavenaposs Gate followers, all in the same outfits, covered in a sheets and being loaded into mortuary trucks, were beamed around the world. As well as their unorms of dark coloured tracksuites and Nike trainers, Applewhiteaposs followers also wore badges declaring they were aposHeavenaposs Gate Away Clubapos. One of the officers at the scene, Detective Rick Scully, has vivid memories of the dayaposs tragedy.  He said: It was like being in the Twilight Zone. We were wandering from room to room to room, and every room we went into we were finding bodies. Youaposre thinking aposwhen is this going to end  How many bodies are going to be in here  How many rooms are there to this place apos Because every room we went in had bodies stacked up like cordwood. Applewhite had started his career in the Armed Forces before going on the teach music at several universities. But following the death of his father in , he fell into a deep depression and left his teaching post. The following year, Applewhite met nurse Bonnie Nettles and the two formed an incredibly close friendship, where they would discuss mysticism. They decided they were aposine mesengersapos and opened a book shop and teaching centre to spead their message before taking what they viewed as their mission on a tour of the US. It was on Applewhite and Nettles travels that he was arrested and jailed for failing toa hire car on time - and he used his time behind bars to develop his theology. When he was released the pair headed to Calornia, where they recruited a commited group of followers to their cause. Their message was extreme - anyone who joined his cult would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed. Over the years this morphed into a belief that the human body was simply a container for the soul, and this would be placed in a new body when they reached the spaceship. As the cult grew, so did its ability to make money and they put down roots. But then, in , Applewhite was dealt a devastating blow when Nettles died from cancer. He told his followers that she had transcended to the aposnext levelapos because she had too much energy to remain on earth. It was after Nettlesapos death that Applewhite really tightened his grip on the cult and he encouraged its members to view him as a Christ-like figure. Throughout the s Heavenaposs Gate started to focus on the suppression of sexual desire with Applewhite and seven of his following even going to the extreme s of surgically castrating themselves. He claimed aposnext levelapos beings had no sexual organs and also forced all the members to wear matching, gender neutral, clothes and to have the same haircuts.By the s, Heavenaposs Gate were living in their mansion in Santa Fe and wanted to get their message out to a wider audience.They recorded to videos appealing for people to joiin them for the last chance to evacuate earth. When Applewhite heard the comet Hale-Bop was approaching the planet, he convinced his followers that Nettles was on board a ship hiding behind it and this was her sign that she wanted he and the rest of his cult to join her.  But the only way they could do this was to commit suicide and leave their aposvesselsapos behind.In March , the group completely cut themselves off from the world and recorded their farewell messages. Applewhite also planned to kill himself because he had said that the group would ascend during his letime, so appointing a successor was unfeasible.Wearing their matching unorms, the cult took barbituates, in some cases in apple sauce, and drank alcohol - and slowly, over the next three days, they all died.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

From regular bus and train services to calling a taxi, it does not pose the same logistical problems as it does living in a rural setting or on an island.#For a veteran living either on the islands or the west coast, however, this can be a huge issue, especiallythey no longer have their own transport and do not wish to be a burden on friends or families.#Families may live in other areas so loneliness is a big issue and pride also inhibits asking for help when it is needed.#As soon as the coronaviruls situation allows, Sandra will be starting support sessions called #Brew and Blether# which will be open to all veterans and their partners.#I hope this may encourage older people, especially these living alone, to come along for advice and company,# explained Sandra.Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice Bureau helped armed forces veterans gain £, in benefits and grants during the last year.Sandra, who has been an adviser for seven years, added: #I do this job because I genuinely love it and I#ve met and worked with amazing people, some of whom have experienced dreadful situations.#It is challenging, but also very rewarding.

when it comes to accessing a coronavirus vaccine, an industry leader has said.Companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline , Johnson and Johnson, and Pfizer are working with researchers across the world to ensure a vaccine can be manufactured at speed once one becomes available.But questions have been raised about who will get access to the doses, and when.Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associationssaid it was widely accepted that once a successful Covid- vaccine is created it will not be available in sufficient quantities from the beginning.He added: ldquoI think I sense a deep responsibility among the industry that we need to be careful about no one left behind.ldquoWhen we look at the scaling-up needs, we do know we will not have sufficient quantities, as from day one, even with the best of efforts.ldquoWe need to be careful that vaccines need to be safe and effective, and they need to be scalable.Over the past

irrespective of where they are, get vaccinated first and it is important that we do have this strong sense of solidarity.Dr Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, said it is also important to prepare for a potential second wave of coronavirus in the autumn.He added: ldquoTo be frank, the challenges will be that every national government would like to get a vaccine for them.ldquoAnd I think, although there are discussions at WHOthe reality is that governments will try to exercise all the leverage that they have to be among the first to receive vaccines and ndash us ndash Irsquom afraid wersquoll be caught in the middle.He continued: ldquoSo Irsquom thinking very carefully what would be the best way to make sure that everybody will get the fair share of supplies that exist as quickly as possible.ldquoAnd that in this fairness, we will not forget the unprivileged countries that commercially play very little role,any, but from the human perspective they all have equal rights.Speaking at an IFPMA media briefing about how more doses could be produced, Dr Bourla explained: ldquoTypically we are producing vaccines in single dose vials.ldquoWe are also exploring with governments right now,it would be more convenientthere are five dose vials, or  dose vials.ldquoBecausewe can find out that this could be a presentation that is acceptable and practical, given the pandemic nature, I think we can resolve a signicant part of the bottleneck in manufacturing.GSK chief executive officer, Emma Walmsley, said it is widely recognised that there is a global need, and that multiple candidates need to be supported in order to get to scale as fast as possible, because the ldquobest way to guarantee access is to have the volume available.At the briefing, AstraZeneca, GSK, Johnson and Johnson, and Pfizer said they would supply Covid- vaccines on a no-profit basis as long as the pandemic lasts.Asked when he thought a vaccine may be available, Pascal Soriot, executive director and chief executive officer at AstraZeneca, which is working to manufacture the University of Oxford vaccine candidate, said ldquobefore the end of the year.He said:

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-cancels-summer-fixtures","story":"It announced earlier this afternoon that all races scheduled for July and August are now cancelled due to

Hopefully, theyrsquoll allow for people to catch up on moments of joy that have been missed or comfort those who have lost.ldquoItrsquos a long way to go but a welcome start.Across the county, plans are afoot to reopen golf courses, bowling greens and garden centres.The First Minister is also expected to give the green light to construction sites to restart as long as social distancing and personal protective equipmentcan be provided.Schools will open on August  but teaching staff are expected tonext month and some pupils who face transitioning from nursery to P and primary to secondary school are likely to come into their new school at the end of next month.Phase one of the Scottish Governmentrsquos four phase route out of lockdown is expected to be confirmed by the First Minister this afternoonwhen she announces her review of the current lockdown restrictions.Last week Ms Sturgeon set out a range of activities which will be allowed including outdoor recreation, meeting with people from other households and letting people who cannot work from hometo workit can be done safely.Iain Gray, East Lothianrsquos MSP, said there were questions which still needed answered by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoWhile the lsquoroute maprsquo is understandably flexible in its later stages, we do know that there should be some easing of restrictions this week, including theof some non-contact sport, the reopening of garden centres and recycling facilities, and being able to visit friends or relatives albeit only outside and two metres apart.ldquoAfter more than two months in lockdown this initial easing will come as a relief to many.ldquoHowever, there are still many issues the Scottish Government need to clary about the way forward, including the expansion of testing to implement the test, trace, isolate and support strategy, measures to tackle the ongoing emergency in our care homes and plans for repairing the economy as we move out of lockdown.ldquoWe have only reached this stage because people have obeyed lockdown, and reduced infection. It is so important as those restrictions ease that we do not slip into behaving aswe are back to normal. If we do, infections will rise again, and restrictions will be re-imposed, not eased.East Lothian Council leader Willie Innes thanked members of the public in the county for following the lockdown restrictions and the huge community response to help the most vulnerable people.He said: ldquoDealing with the Covid- emergency is highly likely to remain a signicant challenge for some considerable time to come. The Scottish Government has published its four-phase lsquoroute maprsquo aimed at restarting society while suppressing the virus and has confirmed that some restrictions will begin to be eased from the end of this week.ldquoIt is very clear that, as progress remains fragile, the easing of lockdown restrictions must be taken very gradually and incrementally.ldquoThroughout this period we have been following the national advice and will continue to do so. ldquoOn a practical note I, along with many others, will welcome the reopening of the recycling centres and the ability to meet friends and family albeit on a restricted basis. East Lothianrsquos golf courses are being prepared to reopen with changes made to ensure safety for staff and members is a priority.Bill Axon, chief executive of enjoyleisure, which runs golf courses at Musselburgh Old Links and Winterfield, Dunbar, said new policies include sneeze guards, masks and visors for staff and asking for flagsticks to remain in place at all times.Mr Axon said: ldquoFor enjoyleisure, the safety of customers and colleagues come first.ldquoWe have been constantly monitoring the latest Government advice surrounding Covid-, and along with guidance issued by the Scottish Golf and the RA, both courses have been adapted to comply with current social distancing policies.ldquoWe ask all of our customers to adhere to the measures in place, so that we can continue to enjoy golf now and into the future.Indoor sports facilities are not included in the phase one changes but Mr Axon said enjoyleisure, which also oversees the majority of them in the county, would continue to follow government guidance on when they are allowed to reopen.About  per cent of staff with enjoyleisure had been furloughed, with no redundancies made.Mr Axon said there was no alternative work which could be offered and highlighted that the impact of the coronavirus had ldquonot been insignicant in terms of income, with income levels dropping by about pound, per month.Malcolm Duck, who is part of the steering group involved in Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast, said: ldquoWe are waiting for the First Minister to give us the date.ldquoThe impression is it will be Friday but I am not sure that has been confirmed yet. Golf clubs will be able to open and people will be able to get on golf courses.Mr Duck encouraged people to visit the  courses across the county when it was safe to do so.He said: ldquoThe weather is great and it will be great to be able to go out on the golf courses.Billy Mellors, county bowls development officer, said not all bowling clubs in East Lothian would be opening their doors and restrictions would be in place.He said: ldquoDepending on what Nicola Sturgeon says on Thursday, bowling clubs are free to open on Friday with some pretty severe restrictions in place.That will include limiting the number of people allowed on the green at any one time, as well as clubhouses not opening.Brian Whellans, president of Haddington Bowling Club, said club bosses were meeting online todayto discuss a way forward.He said: ldquoThe bowling green is ready to go. Wersquove got a greenkeeper that is paid on a monthly basis.

If at all possible, we are asking that only adult customers visit during this critical time.ldquoAlthough wersquore looking forward to seeing our customers again, I have to confess to being a little nervous about re-opening with these measures in place.ldquoHowever, the safety of customers and staff is our priority and we hope that customers will be patient with us whilst we find our feet and adapt.Under the Scottish Governmentrsquos route map to ease lockdown restrictions, outdoor workplaces can resume with ldquophysical distancing measures in place once guidance is agreed, meaning that garden centres can reopen but not their cafes unless it is for takeaway.County recycling centres are due to open to the public on Monday, with social distancing measures introduced.Phase two of the route out of lockdown, which could be introduced at the next review in three weeksrsquo time, could see theof outdoor markets such as Haddington Farmersrsquo Market and more workplaces open as well as the introduction of more social gatherings.Colin Beattie, MSP for Musselburgh, welcomed the phase one plans.Mr Beattie said: ldquoI am pleased with the cautious approach which the Scottish Government is taking towards releasing lockdown.ldquoThe approach is clear and unambiguous compared to the chaos and contradictions south of the border. The absolute priority is protecting lives.ldquoThe economy is certainly going to be our next priority but we can rebuild the economy while we canrsquot bring back someonersquos mum or dadthey contract a terminal case of Covid-.

Wersquove been erted from the highest moral purpose ndash keeping our minds fixed on the loss of fellow human beings and the government decisions which were involved in their deaths ndash to casting our eyes into a gutter of deceit, hypocrisy and selfishness.This is not to say, however, that the media should have held back on coverage of Cummings ndash completely the reverse. Without the forensic scrutiny of journalists wersquod never know about the double standards to which the rich and powerful hold themselves and us. We can now see that the Cummings scandal isnrsquot just a moral affront, itrsquos potentially lethal too. How many people have shrugged their shoulders and said to hell with public health advice in the wake of Cummingsrsquo actions, adopting a lsquo he can do it, so can Irsquo attitude :Sandy Kennedy: To have impact, we must move to action immediatelyHowever, under the cover of such an appalling spectacle many political issues have become distorted at a time when we need clarity of vision and nowhere has that distortion played out more than in Scotland. Cummings has had a unique Caledonian Effect.Letrsquos be frank, the squalid behaviour of Cummings and Johnson has thrown a protective cloak around the the SNP government when it comes to failures over coronavirus. Cummings has unwittingly played something of a blinder for the party and its ambitions for independence.Until the Cummings scandal, most decent minds were concentrated on the SNP governmentrsquos dreadful handling of care home deaths. More than  elderly hospital patients were sent to homes prior to mandatory testing. Around half of Scotlandrsquos deaths have been in care homes.Amid the Cummings scandal, Nicola Sturgeon said she found the care home deaths ldquoheartbreaking. Shersquos a woman of decency so her emotional response is to be believed. That doesnrsquot excuse her Governmentrsquos failures, however. Yet with Cummings soaking up headlines, scrutiny of the issue shrunk. Pressure on health secretary Jeane Freeman over her mistakes weakened.We cannot simply accept such failings in Holyrood because therersquos a tawdry circus of shame in Westminster that draws attention away. You didnrsquot need a science degree to know that the elderly were most at risk. However, there was no mandatory testing for all new care home residents in Scotland until April .The Cummings scandal has overshadowed claims that the transfer of elderly patients from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow to Gartnavel led to the virus spreading like it was onboard a ldquocruise ship. Gartnavel is said to have recorded  cases and  deaths in a matter of weeks. The buck for this stops at the desk of the health secretary and the First Minister.Concerns about a possible cover-up by the Scottish Government over an early outbreak of coronavirus in Edinburgh have been eclipsed by the Cummings scandal. Lockdown came too late here ndash just as it did in England. Testing and tracing have been inadequate. Itrsquos been a catalogue of one failure after another.From the pandemicrsquos early days, there wasnrsquot that much of a substantive dference in policy between Holyrood and Westminster. Increasingly, though, Sturgeon has begun to forge Scotlandrsquos own path but itrsquos still far from successful. We arenrsquot New Zealand, thatrsquos for sure.Set against the Johnson government, anything would look good. Some % of Scots think Sturgeon has handled the crisis well. However, comparing pretty bad to bloody useless shouldnrsquot be the yardstick by which we measure what our governments do for us.:Jedbergh jousting team challenge to film behind closed doorsThe SNP are frankly lucky to have this shameless and idiotic government in London in the shape of Cummings and Johnson. But that, sadly, makes the Scottish people less lucky. The failings in Scotland arenrsquot any less meaningful just because Boris Johnson is a disaster. If Westminster was being run by a competent leader, the SNPrsquos behaviour would seem signicantly more concerning.The Cummings Effect is also shaping other parties. Some Scottish Tories finally distanced themselves from the UK leadership, with calls for Cummings to go. It simply adds to the notion that the Scottish Tories should strike out alone and leave the UK fold. It also reinforces the perception that the partyrsquos voice here is relatively meaningless.What have Scottish Labour or the Scottish LibDems done that matters throughout the Cummings scandal  Nothing. Whatrsquos the point of Scottish Labour  When it comes to Labour the only story in town is Keir Starmer ndash the great hope. Nice guy as he may be, Richard Leonard doesnrsquot cut through ndash even at a time like this, with Cummings, when a butter kne could cut throughit had the will. The Greens also need to find their voice.When it comes to independence, Cummings must have an effect on floating voters, and soft No voters. Irsquom a Yes voter, and Irsquove been increasingly disheartened in the direction of travel the independence movement has taken in recent years. The SNP base is beyond ugly, the idea of independence has intellectually stagnated, and independence itself has provided the SNP with a shield to hide bad governance behind as its voters will tolerate any failing as long as talk of independence is thrown out now and again as red meat.But even jaded Yes voters like me feel a little galvanised now by the Cummings scandal. I may be uneasy with the independence package currently on offer ndash too many unanswered questions, and the whf of populism, Scottish exceptionalism and thin-skinned nationalism ndash but compared to where Westminster is going, I know which option looks more appealing. Westminster has been a corrupt failure for generations, now itrsquos a sick, cruel joke played on the British people.This pandemic hasnrsquot been handled well or adequately by Scotland and its government. Nevertheless, even a dysal Scotland is better than whatever the hell is happening in Westminster.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

From the inability to spend time with family and friends to the impact on businesses, the effect has been profound and far-reaching.  Thanks to those efforts, however, we have seen a downward trend in new cases of infection that has enabled the Scottish Government to begin easing restrictions.“Despite this initial relaxation of the rules, however, I was pleased to hear the First Minister reiterate that travelling to the islands, other than in exceptional circumstances, is still not possible for now.  It is a dficult message, but absolutely the right one at this time.“We know that many people across the UK, and further afield, look forward to visiting Orkney at this time of year.  However, the safety of our community remains paramount and there is still some way to go before we can begin welcoming visitors again.“The First Minister’s message though is a reminder of the signicant economic impact that the shutdown of the tourism sector has on Orkney.  The grant support provided by the UK and Scottish governments to mitigate this impact has been welcome, but too many local businesses still find they are falling between the cracks.“I will continue to work with Ministers to ensure that gaps in support are closed.  Meantime, I would urge the public to keep following the advice of the government and hopefully it won’t be long before we can look forward to visitors ing to Orkney”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

The guidance stresses the need for personal responsibility when travelling and this co-operation is vital as we work to provide a safe transport system that supports the people of Scotland.“The route map offers a path away from the current restrictions, but the virus is still with us,we move too quickly or without appropriate diligence, it could rapidly run out of control again. “The level of physical distancing required as we navigate the phases of the route map will affect the available capacity of public transport. Operators estimate capacity will be between  per cent and  per cent of normal availability even with full services resumed. “A system that previously had . million journeys per day will be signicantly constrained. So today, I am urging employers, operators and the public to embrace these changes and help us all adapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core, for the immediate future at least, flattens peak travel demand and has a strong focus on active travel.“We are looking to increase the frequency of public transport. But reducing the demand for transport is vitally important. We are urging employers to show leadership and be as flexible as possible to allow earlier or later starting and finishing times for those that have to travel to work.  “Over the coming weeks and working with our local authority partners, the transport transition plan will look to manage demand and increase availability of road space and priority for walking, cycling, wheeling and bus. “We have a real opportunity to secure a positive and lasting change, one which supports sustainable travel habits. I am therefore delighted to confirm that the ‘Spaces for People’ fund for local authorities has proven so popular that it is being increased to £ million.“We all have a personal responsibility to take steps to protect ourselves and others. It is vital that we continue to keep two metres physical distance wherever possible, wash hands regularly and maintain good cough hygiene.  “Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be dficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff.

It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!! As for the complex causes of obesity, it is really simple Peter, it is not even class-related. It is simply eating more than food than your body needs. Whatever socio-psychological hogwash you may spout, in the final analysis, comes down to eating too much.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

August date is a week earlier than previously scheduled for the - Highland school term.Early Learning and childcare settings will open over the summer, while teachers – currently delivering lessons from home – will from June be allowed into schools to prepare and plan for the new way of working and welcoming pupils back.While the school gates will open again, parents have been told to expect a mix of classroom and home learning to continue.The agreement reached between councils, professional associations and parent representatives means:Skye councillor John Finlayson, who chairs Highland Council’s education committee, said Mr Swinney’s announcement was broadly in line with the expectations of the authority’s education recovery group.However, he said he was pleased that local authorities would be given flexibility in their approach.He said: “Clearly the challenges each authority faces will be signicantly dferent and within Highland itself we will have dferent challenges in urban and rural areas.“Local authorities have been given the flexibility to plan and deliver ato education in a manner that suits local circumstances and the council’s education improvement team, supported by other officers, in consultationwith school leaders and school staff, will look to implement approaches that enable pupils to get back to school.“A blended approach to learning will continue for a while yet. Whatever is implemented will put the wellbeing of our children at its heart.”Schools closed on th March and since then pupils have been learning at home, through lessons delivered online by teachers.Other pledges made by Mr Swinney included one to expand the school estate, using libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference venues or taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to increase the time children can spend with their teachers.He also suggested that retired teachers couldto school as part of plans to limit class sizes.To support digital home learning, the Scottish Government is to invest £ million for , laptops or tablets – with internet access provided – for disadvantaged childrenMr Swinney added “This is not, however, ato schooling as we knew it # schools are not ing to normal at this stage.“To keep our pupils and staff safe we will implement physical distancing, staggered arrival and departure times, staggered break times, increased hand hygiene, enhanced cleaning regimes and a range of other measures.“That means a new model of teaching, learning and support will have to be delivered. Precise details will y from school to school but for the vast majority, classes are going to be much smaller to allow physical distancing and, as a result, children are likely to spend about half their time learning at home.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cummings-1.jpg","title":"s e am beul a labhras ach an gniomh a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTha fhios’am gun can cuid gu bheil an dol a-mach aig Dominic Cummings agus aig an fhear a tha os a chionnBoris MacIain dìreach ceangailte ri ‘Bolgan Beag Westminster’ mar a chanas iad, ach tha e fada nas farsainge agus nas doimhne agus nas cudromaiche agus nas cunnartaiche na sin.Oir tha na daoine sin, latha as deoghaidh latha, a’ togail fianais gu bheil aon lagh ann airson uaisleanna dùthcha seo, agus lagh eile ann dha na daoine cumanta – dhutsa agus dhòmhsa.A bharrachd air mar a bha daoine faireachdainn nuair a rinn an Riaghaltasionnsaigh air Iraq air sàilean Seòras Bush, chan fhaca mise daoine cumanta cho crosta agus cho cridhe-briseach agus a tha iad air a bhith le mar a tha An Cuimeanach agus MacIain agus na pupaidean eile anns A’ Chaibineat gan giùlain fhèin.Agus san giùlain sin air mullach, agus ceangailte ris, an droch-làimsheachaidh a tha air a dhèanamh air an galair Covid  le na mìltean mòra nise air air am beatha chall.Tha e doirbh a thuigsinn a bheil na daoine a tha gar riaghladh mar sin a dh’aona-ghnothach, no tro aineolas agus fèinealachd.An dara fear dhiubh sin, saoilidh mi.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus.

Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

There will be thousands of job losses, he said.I#ll be proposing that a task force is set up to focus on how best we get the city back up and running. I#d like to see a memorial built to all those who have lost their lives from Covid-.In an exclusive interview with the Belfast , the next Lord Mayor talked about being the first single dad in the job.The SDLP is set to nominate its poll-topping Ardoyne councillor, Paul McCusker, as Deputy Lord Mayor. A nurse in the Mater Hospital, he is a community activist known for his work with the homeless.Covid- will make Monday#s mayoral installation ceremony very dferent from those in previous years. Social distancing means there can#t be a full meeting of all  councillors. Instead, each party will nominate a small number of representatives to attend.The practice of the outgoing Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor placing the chain of office around the shoulders of their successors will be suspended.Mr McCoubrey succeeds Sinn Fein#s Danny Baker and Mr McCusker takes over from Alliance#s Peter McReynolds.The next Lord Mayor hopes that, despite the restrictions, his mother and five children can watch proceedings from the public gallery in City Hall.Mr McCoubrey will also not have the crowded diary of public engagements that usually awaits new Lord Mayors. It#s very frustrating, he said. Once restrictions ease, I want to be out thanking our NHS and care workers, and those who have been delivering food parcels to the old and vulnerable.Mr McCoubrey, who has been a councillor for  years, said his working-class roots would be to the fore during his mayoralty.I grew up in Springmartin and I still live there. We had nothing. We were no dferent from the people in Springhill across the peace line. I#m a proud unionist but I want to be a Lord Mayor for the people of Springmartin, Springhill and all in this city, whatever their politics.Asked about his attitude to gay marriage, which his party opposes, he said: Same-sex marriage is legal here, and I#ve always taken the approach of live and let live. As Lord Mayor I want everyone to feel welcome in this city regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Mr McCoubrey was first elected as a councillor for the Ulster Democratic Party , the UDA#s political wing. He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

Duane Farrell, CEO of relationship counselling service Relate NI, has said anxieties around money, childcare and living space are all putting stress on couples and households as lockdown continues. He said as traditional forms of support for households, such as receiving health visitors, fall away, families are looking for support for their relationships. Speaking to the BelfastCoronavirus podcast, he said: Our relationships are an essential part of our health and our wellbeing at this time, and sometimes when there are challenges, that can also affect our health and wellbeing. It#s a perfect storm that households are experiencing at the moment - increases in worries about finances as people are furloughed or let go from their jobs, really close proximity, people will have a whole host of things that take up their week and they have all disappeared.It#s led to people relying much more on other family members for support - which can sometimes expose cracks in relationships, he said.

Any existing tensions that there are in a relationship are being brought sharply into focus during lockdown in these last two months, even where relationships have previously been really strong. There are new challenges being faced because of the pressure people are under. Tensions will be exacerbated but even stronger relationships will face tests.Mr Farrell said couples and families are advised by Relate NI to keep lines of communication open.

Taking that time out to communicate clearly and family members listening and responding as much as possible, he said.

You#re trying to take out those opportunities for conflict. Perhaps the dining room table is used by children in the morning for school work and it#s used by mum and dad for other things in the afternoon.The PSNI have reported an increase in incidents of domestic violence in recent weeks. Mr Farrell appealed to those victims to ask for help. It#s important to say the police, Women#s Aid, the Domestic Sexual Violence helpline are there to support people in that situation. being locked down in people#s homes, it#s not necessarily a safe place for everybody. It#s important to reach out and know that there are services out there to support them.When asked whether there has been an increase in couples contacting Relate NI who are hoping to separate, he said while he hasn#t heard of an increase, there is a possibility that will happen post-lockdown.

This has been an unprecedented time when faithful Catholics have been unable to receive the Eucharist for months.While many churches have been availing of streaming services via webcams and social media over recent weeks, it#s not the same as being present for Mass.I have a lot of anxious parents whose children haven#t yet been baptised so as soon as it is safe we should be doing that.Fr McCafferty added: Clergy will adapt to the current danger and make things as safe as possible. Older people may be disappointed at not being able toimmediately but we have to consider their safety. The draft plan also envisages confirmation ceremonies taking place in mid-September but advises that such celebrations would be conducted by the parish priest and may have to take place in small groups over successive days.The plan aims to ensure that all preparations are made so that churches are ready to move once the civil authorities in both Northern Ireland and the Republic give approval.Government sources in Dublin have hinted that phase four of its roadmap - when public Masses are due to begin from July  - could be brought forward to the end of Junethe virus continues to be successfully managed.The -point programme, which is expected to be boiled down to key issues in the coming days, also bans choirs and congregational singing when churches re-open.It suggested that dioceses prepare short videos similar to aircraft safety demonstrations to assist parishioners in correct behaviour when ing to Mass.The document says: It is clear that re-opening the pastoral le of the Church will be far more challenging institutionally than anything we have been through in the past few months. Our biggest challenge may be lack of motivation to do all that is required on the part of some, and unbridled enthusiasm to do everything on the part of others.It needs to be clearly understood, however, that churches will only be able to re-open for public liturgy when the proper procedures have been put in place.Earlier this week, Archbishop Eamon Martin said it was sad and disappointing that the Covid- restrictions have lasted throughout the Easter season and congregations are still unable to gather physically.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Executive agrees further easing of lockdown as two further deaths announcedCoronavirus: Northern Ireland shoppers warned a world of change is on the way after lockdown#It#s a disaster ... no way I would cycle next to heavy traffic with no safety barrier# - Cyclists criticise Sydenham Bypass resurfacingNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

Allowing hotels to take bookings was one of the lockdown relaxation measures proposed by the Executive at their daily briefing on Thursday.If the infection rate does not increase then hotels could be allowed to take bookings from June .However the Executive has not indicated when they could potentially reopen.First Minister Arlene Foster said more information on the matter would be available next week following the publishing of further guidance from the Department of Economy. The Northern Ireland Hotels Federationsaid the sector had been left disappointed by the announcement.However Mrs Foster defended the decision and denied it was contradictory. I think we#ve been listening very carefully to not just what hoteliers have been saying to us, but right across the tourism sector, the DUP leader said.They are saying to us that they want to take bookings at risk and we#re saying to them they are of course free to take bookings at risk.The economy minister is also bringing forward next week, she#s going to look right across the tourism and particularly the accommodation sector, to see what more guidance we can give them in relation to that. Mrs Foster said it would allow hotels to plan for the future. If someone rings up and wants to book a hotel in advance for sometime in late summer that is a matter for them, they can take that booking, thenwe can come forward and say, before that time, that hotels can open then that booking can be realised, the First Minister said. We absolutely recognise the devastating impact this has had, particularly on the tourism industry.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNIHF chief executive Janice Gault FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNIHF chief executive Janice GaultHowever NIHF CEO Janice Gault said the announcement only adds to the confusion around when hotels can actually open.As an industry, we are keen to open in a safe and secure manner giving staff and customers reassurance. Taking a hotel booking on an ‘on spec’ basis without any agreed pathway is a far from ideal situation, she said.It makes it very dficult to plan, budget and set guidelines for the sector. We understand further information will be imparted on the th June after the Executive has reviewed specic information on the entire accommodation sector.Hotels are frustrated with many now aligning themselves with dates already agreed for opening in the south of Ireland and others using an early July date as indicated by the Prime Minister.Mrs Gault said hotels respected that all dates are subject to changethere is any move in the ‘R’ rate or any change to the control of the pandemic.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said that the decision represents forward momentum. It#s signposting to the fact hotels should be getting ready to take bookings, the Sinn Fein vice-President said. It#s not just hotels, it#s also BBs, self-catering, caravans, all those things.I think today is forward momentum and we#ll come back to you next week whenever we have this paper around the whole tourism sector.

It#s a  Mustang, and Ireland and Ulster winger Jacob Stockdale couldn#t be happier working on his classic car, with its blue bodywork and two go-faster stripes down its back.The -year-old professional rugby player bought the car on eBay a year ago and the last two months of lockdown in Belfast has given him the luxury of time to pull on his mechanic#s overalls and explore the iconic #first gen# Mustang.Jacob won#t reveal how much he paid for the car which came off the Ford assembly line two years after the first Mustang debuted.It probably was not one of my wisest purchases, but I bought it as a bit of a project car, something to do a bit of work to as a hobby and I love it, said the Lurgan native.Going into lockdown has given me time to tinker away on the car, and I#ve done quite a bit of work on it. I#ve replaced the entire suspension.I re-wired a few things like the horn and the radio because they were both draining the battery.And a year after arriving in Belfast from London, the car still hasn#t a name.No, funnily enough I haven#t given it a name.

I wanted to take the pressure off them and do something for the whole denomination, providing some normality perhaps, he said.Uppermost in my mind also was the sense of identity, of being a Presbyterian family who could not meet together. I wanted to give expression to that in the midst of everything.He added: We have all been affected by the pandemic, and my heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones across our island and those who have battled against the virus. They have been in my thoughts and prayers, just as those who continue to go that extra mile in providing daily care for them in our hospitals and care homes. It has been incredible and as a church we thank God for their selfless service and sacrice.The Rev Henry last preached to a church congregation on March . I have been askedI feel that I have been #locked-out# because of the Covid- emergency, he said.We have all had to make adjustments and to live with changed times. As a Moderator your diary is full, you know exactly what you are doing and then suddenly  weeks or more are wiped. However just as in the months before the lockdown, I have been busy and in some ways even busier, but in a dferent way. I have done  weekly pre-recorded services, with the last one going out on Sunday.He admitted that his year in the post had pushed me out of my comfort zone. I am naturally quite shy and reserved and that is not who a Moderator is. You have to get out there, speak up and do the things you are called to do, he said.He said that since the lockdown the Irish church leaders have met more frequently, through video-conferencing, nearly every two weeks. He has already taken part in online meetings with the First and Deputy First Ministers, UK church leaders and the Taioseach. The Moderator#s outgoing address will be streamed live on Monday night during the installation service for the new Moderator, Rev David Bruce.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Executive agrees further easing of lockdown as two further deaths announcedCoronavirus: Northern Ireland shoppers warned a world of change is on the way after lockdown#It#s a disaster ... no way I would cycle next to heavy traffic with no safety barrier# - Cyclists criticise Sydenham Bypass resurfacingNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The former Ballinderry Chairman is Ulster GAAs Head of Operations, but has been called onto the GAAs Covid- Advisory Group, chaired by Chairman of Health and Safety group Shay Bannon. “Our work is less than two weeks old,” McGeehan told the County Derry Post, of the group that reports directly to President John Horan and Director General Tom Ryan. “We are there to provide advice and make recommendations. In terms of the decisions, they will be made by the GAAs management committee. googletag.cmd.push “Our remit is a short and sharp piece of work to develop protocols of how and on what basis,it is possible, will it be possible toto training, playing and eventually watching games again.” Professor Mary Horgan, a professor in infectious diseases, has been added to the group. She has previously been advising other world governing bodies of sport. “Her role is crucial in helping voluntary bodies like the GAA,” McGeehan feels. “All of this needs to be medically driven, whether is it is public health advice from the governments or the research around the vaccines and all that might be required in the future.” googletag.cmd.push The committee have, as McGeehan terms it, the easy job, with GAA management having the final call. An initial plan of inter-county action in October and club pencilled in for mid-July, was based on a cut back version. Footballs Tier  championship, the Super s and the qualiers were likely to be shelved, as were the group stages in the hurling championship. In terms of Derry, the senior hurlers had qualied for the NHL promotion play-off. It was initially hoped that games involving relegation and promotion couldve been pencilled into the overall plan, in a bid to provide a clean slate for . “There is no play-book to this and I dont think anyone knowsany of the league games could be played,” was McGeehans opinion on the situation. “At the minute, the focus is on whether activity willat all and what it would require to bring that activity back. No formal decision has been made on the league or the championship.” He also has sympathy for Antrim and Armagh footballers who worked themselves into promising league positions. “That decision will be taken very carefully and on the basis of what space there is. As the weeks go on, I think it becomes less likely that there will be room for them, but I wouldnt rule them out completely.” In terms of club activity, counties have been working away to come up with plans that could be activated once there is a green light. It is likely that club leagues will be scrapped with,there is any action, a series of warm-up games ahead of a knock-out championship. “It would be very important for a lead-in period,” McGeehan feels. “You would want to give club players time to get collective training under their belt, to get them out. Given the timescale, there mightnt be room for many league games. “The window is a moving piste, in that the GAA talked about October and November . In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must. IDEAL “An ideal situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so. From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change. In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues. There are issues over social isolation. I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary. We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school. He asks: “Is there a way, after risk assessments, that you are able to get juvenile activity moving and you are able to get kids out on the pitch again ” “If that is an area of less-risk for the spread of the disease and children have been less affected by it, that presents an opportunity to get them out whenever there is the science to be able to do that.” From the point of view of testing, McGeehan – while pointing out that inter-county players are deemed elite – the GAA is dferent to the Premier League, or indeed the Bundesliga that has two rounds complete since their resumption. “We are dferent,” he begins. “We are neither professional nor semi-professional. From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job. They are amateurs, they have a days work and they have families.” GAA Covid- Advisory Group Shay Bannon- existing Chairman of Health and Safety groupDick Clerkin Dr Pat O’Neill Dr Kevin Moran Dr Jim O’Donovan Dr Seaacuten Moffatt Paul Flynn Stephen McGeehan Tony McGuinness Sineacutead McNulty Helen O’Rourke Professor Mary Horgan John Horan Tom Ryan Feargal McGill  RELATED - Sport NI announce new plans forto activity .In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must.IDEAL“An idea situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so.From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change.In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues.There are issues over social isolation.I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary.We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill announced that the Magee Medical School had been agreed and that students would start next September. Days later Economy Minister Diane Dodds said signicant work is required and questioned Ulster Universitys financial stability. She added that further reports would be submitted to the Executive. Seeking clarity on the matter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “I have today submitted a written question asking health minister Robin Swannhe will publish his department’s own internal business case for the Magee Medical School. We need greater transparency. googletag.cmd.push “While I very strongly welcome the progress made recently with regard to the Magee Medical School, we also have to impose sunlight on the process to learn where the blockages are. It is very important that we keep the pressure on to ensure the Magee Medical School opens in September . “I emphasised this in my speech in the Northern Ireland Assembly this evening, in which I complained about the lack of transparency over the progress on the Medical School and compared this to the confusion over the plans for Northern Ireland after the end of the Brexit transition period.” In part of that speech, she said: “I met – virtually of course – yesterday with senior representatives of Ulster University. I left the meeting with the sense that they were as in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the Medical School as we in Northern Ireland are about the new customs arrangements after Brexit. googletag.cmd.push “We need to know what is going on. We need greater transparency. That applies to the British government’s plans for Brexit, and also to the plans of our own government – the Executive and its senior officials – when it comes to the Magee Medical School.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that a Medical School at Magee had been agreed by the Executive with an anticipated September  opening. However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood amongst others sought further detail saying student intake next year was ‘far from certain’. Speaking at a Stormont debate on the Budget Bill this week, DUP MLA Mervyn Storey - a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board - challenged the way finances have been distributed. googletag.cmd.push To fulfil the commitment made to police officers in the New Decade, New Approach document would cost poundm per year, he said, which the finance minister has available. He continued: “There are those who would like the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be run into the ground and be so constrained that would be incapable of dealing with public order and the many challenges that it faces.” The North Antrim MLA and former finance minister said poundm was allocated to the new medical facility in Derry. “When anyone looks at the current estimates for the running - the capital and the resource - of that project, the cost will be in excess of pound million. googletag.cmd.push “Some people are hanging their hats on the City Deal providing the additional money, but there is no doubt that it will have recurring costs that have to come back to the Executive,” he added. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Mr Storey went on to say that a ‘deal is a deal’ and in the New Decade, New Approach document there is an agreement to fund a medical school, and, on the opposite page, a commitment to increase police numbers to ,. It leads to the question, he said, what was the process to remove the medical school from the Department for the Economy and the Department of Health and move it to the Executive Office  “Why did that happen, given the fact that responsibility for the delivery of that project lay primarily in those two departments ” TIME RESTRAINTS In responseSinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy said: “First, in relation to the PSNI bid and the members view that it was part of a deal. “If it was part of a deal, it is not the responsibility of the Finance Minister to go in and demand that the Justice Minister brings forward a proposition. There is a party leaders forum, which, I think, was set up as a consequence of NDNA in order to discuss issues that might be outside the day-to-day workings of Departments. “If there is an argument that that commitment is not being met, I suggest to the member that that is the area in which to raise it and, hopefully, then secure an agreement. I am more than happy to play my part in that.” With regard to the Magee campus and Ulster University situation, the finance minister said there was a ‘time pressure on agreements’ that needed to be made about matched funding of the inclusive future fund and also about the intake for the graduate-entry medical school. “There was a lack of agreement between both departments on which one would have lead responsibility for that.” He concluded: “In those circumstances, correctly, the Executive Office and the offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister stepped in to try to arbitrate and find a way through that. “That is how it ended up in that department.” DERRY REPRESENTATIVES During the sitting, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she met with senior representatives of Ulster University and left the meeting with the sense that they were in the dark about what happens now in terms of progressing the business case for the medical school. “We need to know what is going on. We need more detail, and we need greater transparency. That applies to the British Governments plan for Brexit, but it also applies to the plans of our Government, the Executive Office and senior officials when it comes to the Magee medical school. “The medical school is due to open its doors in September . “Like every other elected representative and everybody in the city, I was delighted by the announcement, but a lot of work needs to be done for that to take place. It needs to be done very quickly, with a sense of urgency, and I urge the joint First Ministers to proceed at pace.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan commented: “You have two Derry representatives speaking one after another. “Not only are we obviously very passionate about where we come from but we are passionate about delivering the projects that have been worked on for many years. “The recent announcement of match funding for the Derry City and Strabane strategic growth plan and inclusive future fund, alongside the Executive commitment to open the medical school at Magee, are examples of what can and should be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this weeks County Derry Post, a special feature looks into the Derry and Kerry minor teams of recent seasons, as well as a look at the changing landscape on the Oakleafers senior front, where the players are graduating into. Of that total,  have played in the championship, including a  appearance between the posts for then goalkeeping coach Michael Conlan. In all seven goalkeepers have been used, with another goalkeeper coach, Barry Gillis, being listed as an unused sub as cover for another goalkeeping crisis. googletag.cmd.push Conor McAtamney has played most games. Having played in all but one league game under Damian Barton and Damian McErlain, his two stoppage time appearances this season wouldve have amounted to more than three or four minutes. The extended Slaughtneil championship runs left Barton and McErlain preparing a team with both hands tied up their back, such is Shane McGuigans influence up front. Derry also had to patch up a defence that has been without Brendan Rogers and the McKaigue brothers. The fact that a county can be so dependant on one club is a major concern going forward. With a more competitive club championship in recent years, that should change. Even so, there has so be some serious planning into maximising players coming from both intermediate ranks and the city. googletag.cmd.push When you think of Galway being an established Division  county, with Corofin shooting the lights out at club level. With such a revolving door at the entrance to Owenbeg, with players dropping out of  and dferent managers, rightly, having their own ideas on selections, there is no continuity. Without this, how can a kick-out strategy be developed, defined marking alignments or a pattern of play ever be established. During the same time window, Monaghan used  players and Donegal  - in both league and championship. Grab a copy of the paper for the feature in full.

I owe everything to the players and management who made all my successes possible.  - Damien McCusker  Easy solution here. This man was way ahead of his time in the number one spot. He played outfield for his club and it showed in his distribution and confidence with the ball. His kicking out was superb and would have found you with a ‘short’on. A big quiet leader and gentleman as well.Beer rating - ..  - Kieran McKeever  In his era, would have been the first man selected in any Derry side. He was the greatest corner back when you had to play corner back, giving me the freedom to go forward without having a worry behind me. Had many a spat with him in Dungiven colours and we always came out the other side as friends. Class personied.Beer rating –    - Kevin McCloy  Was too young to be about in Lavey’s really successful years but matured into a brilliant full-back. I coached him at U and never saw anyone who could read the game like him at that age. He deservedly got an all-star in  and gave Lavey and Derry many years of great service. Beer rating – .  - Tony Scullion  He would walk onto any team in the land. He didn’t like stretching and once smoked a cigarette while warming up. He didn’t fancy training one bit, yet he was imperious as a defender. This four all-stars tells the tale. He was unlucky not to win a county championship with a very good Ballinascreen team in those years. Beer rating – .   - Paul McFlynn  He played number five after I left the Derry team for many years and was a superb footballer. Paul was a very underrated tackler and always grabbed you a point at the other end. He was unbelievably instrumental in Loups two championship wins and their Ulster triumph. He was quiet but so influential on the pitch.Beer rating – .   - Anthony McGurk  Although, at , he made fleeting and telling impacts for our  team from the bench, I’m going to allow him in here. He is reason why the rest of us played football in the house. We grew up travelling everywhereto watch him. His Derry side wasnt far off the  side in terms of talent. A pure talent, legend, leader and a great influence our family.Beer rating . .  - Joe Irwin  When I came into the Derry team, Joe Irwin was the best player in our county bar none. There was a defiance, strength and ruggedness that yielded him unplayable. Unlucky not to be around in  but was a great player for Derry and a decent Drumsurn team of the ’s. Great lad too. Beer rating – . .  - Anthony Tohill  Anthony was simply the best as an all round player of my time. There was just no one to touch him. He was tall, strong, athletic, skillful, brainy, dedicated and had possessed two good feet. The big man was such a big gentleman as well – there is nothing more to say.Beer rating –  .  - Gregory McCartan . The single most reason why the Down of  regained their levels of . A midfielder who covered serious ground on the pitch and also could kick long range frees. He would always chip in with an odd point from play as well. He was a massive player for Down throughout the s and he could sing nearly as well as he played too! Beer rating –    - Dermot McNicholl  The greatest underage player of all time. I grew up at St Pat’s admiring and living in awe of Spoofer. A great leader in school for me as well as Derry minors. Superbly dedicated footballer who was unlucky not to start in , but made many telling contributions. You couldn’t talk about Derry football without mentioning him.Beer rating –  .  - Brian Conlon  I was a lucky man to play in the same Queen’s team and share a lecture theatre as well. He would have won two All-Ireland’s with Downnot for his serious injury. He had everything as a footballer, with two great feet and saw everything happening around him. He would have been a success at anything, shown by the companyhe grew. RIP Brian.  - Peter Canavan  One of the finest players to grace the pitch. He was unbelievably tricky in finding space and had two super feet. A massive influence for Tyrone in terms of scoring and leadership. The reason that Errigal Ciaran became so successful and why the song ‘oh you’ll never bring the Sam Maguire home’ was but to bed. Beer rating – . .  - Joseph Brolly  Joe was a real corner forward who always got you a handful of points in any game. He flourished in  for Derry and for many years after. One of the best club players I’ve ever played against in a really talented ‘sirs’ team of that era. A joy to play with and socialise with. Always full of the craic in training and games and still is! Beer rating –    - Mickey Linden  I played with him for Ulster in the Railway Cup and was delighted as it was a nightmare to play against him! He was possibly the best forward I have ever marked . A superb speedy corner forward who scored at will. A real gent as well.Beer rating –  .  - Enda Gormley  ‘Edna’ as he was known, was one of the most dedicated footballers I have ever played with. He trained like a professional and got what he deserved. I’ll never forget his days in Maghera Rec on the running machines. A great scorer from play and frees. He was part of a decent Watties side at the turn of the s. He had a fantastic All-Ireland final in , after getting a slap.Beer rating – . . RELATED - The club hurling team of the decade More...

Its fair to say that this crisis has made many of us pause for thought and re-evaluate not just our own behaviour but also many of our previous beliefs. Our new heroes are the cleaners, carers, delivery drivers, shop workers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, nurses and many other professions now commonly described as frontline workers. I was getting a few tyres on my car this week and when I asked the guy had they closed he said no we couldnt as we have a contract with the Ambulance Service and needed to be there to provide help for them and others who needed to go to work.” googletag.cmd.push Without these people putting their own lives at risk the death toll caused by coronavirus would have been off the charts. Prior to all of this, most people took for granted the work done by many of these iniduals. We never really gave it much thought. Now, however, we hail many of them as heroes. We clap for them and we now recognise how much better our society is because of their effort. As I said earlier, a global pandemic has really caused us to pause and reflect and hopefully recalibrate what we as a society should see as important. So, what should we learn from this crisis and what should we build on as a society after it  googletag.cmd.push I used the word recalibrate deliberately because I hope its not a temporary outpouring of sentiment for these many professions followed up by a speedyto the way things were before. Prior to the crisis we saw for example the care sector attract little of our attention or interest. Its a key sector with hundreds of thousands employed right across Ireland and the UK. Salaries are often minimum wage or just above. The work of caring for our loved ones and ensuring they have a good quality of le is often classed as low skilled. Their working conditions and pay never interested many of us or the press media but in this crisis their dedication to care for the most vulnerable members of our society has been astonishing. Their treatment by this government in regard to PPE and testing has cost the lives of hundreds of care workers. Weve clapped for everyone in the NHS and the care workers on many Thursday evenings in March and April. Hopefully after this crisis passes, we will support their right to be paid fairly for the essential frontline work they do. I could say the same for the thousands of cleaners who are on minimum wage and whose efforts kept hospitals and many other facilities open throughout the crisis. Also, think of the hospital porters and canteen staff who are often paid low salaries who risked their own exposure to the virus to care for others. The doctors and consultants are front and centre of this fight and their effort too has been exemplary but the vital effort of many others on the fringe cant be forgotten. And it hasnt just been the workers within the public sector or the low paid within the private sector that have stood out in this crisis. Without a doubt the contribution of charities, community enterprises, social enterprises and co-operatives right across these islands has been remarkable. From delivering vital food parcels to the needy, to making much needed PPE their effort in the midst of this crisis has been remarkable. Thousands of peoplein this city have seen first-hand and benefited first-hand from their efforts. Quite often the support they have given was only possible through thefinancial support from the public sector. This crisis should teach many within the public sector that these partnerships can bring real positive outcomes and should be built on rather than withdrawn after this passes. Many people in broader society see social enterprises often in a bad light. This is partially due to the narrow view of business being solely for profit and TV shows like theDragon’s Den dont help. In reality, Derry has many profitable well runsocial enterprises throughout the city and during this crisis many of them have stood with the community. Hopefully when this crisis is over, we wont allow ourselves to forget the people who kept the economy and society going. We will stand with them and support their calls for better pay and conditions. This week we already seen attempts by the Tories to make migrant NHS workers pay the surcharge be met with a public backlash. It forced the Tories to do a U-turn on the policy. People power does work. We really have to mobilise it more. And its not just me who thinks that this crisis provides the perfect  to build a fairer society. Jamie Dimon, the billionaire CEO of JP Morgan, said last week that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as awake-up call to build a better society. He added: It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long.” Jamie Dimon wrote this in a memo issued before the JP Morgan Annual Shareholders Meeting. He went on to say: The last few months have laid bare the reality that even before the pandemic hit, far too many people were living on the edge.” Mr Dimon is a billionaire banker andJoe Biden wins the US Presidency many believe he will the next Treasury Secretary of the United States. Im not a huge fan of a billionaire banker but I cant disagree with his sentiment. In the US the pandemic showed that the largest economy in the world had far too many workers living from pay cheque to pay cheque. So, as we move forward out of this crisis dont forget who the heroes in the economy were. This will of course mean us putting a higher value on the work that manyof them do.Its a national disgrace how we treat, pay and value the work that carers do. Is it too much to pay them more than pound. per hour to look after our mothers and fathers and grandparents  If you asked  people this question, Im sure the vast majority would agree that care workers are underpaid and undervalued. As a society we need to change this. Im optimisticthat the public sector will see the benefits of real partnerships with the social enterprise sector. The oftenreported public private partnership is not the only option. This crisis has shown that often the private sector is not able toin the same way as a social enterprise can. Finally, I hope that any attempt by politicians to short change or ignore the plight of the workers who held the frontline will be met with a swt backlash from the public. If paying public sector workers more means more taxes, then Im all for that. If increasing the minimum wage to pound per hour means increased prices, then the upside is a fairer society.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either.

Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline, as you can see from the info bars in this feature. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellafor Maghera in the final. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline, as you can see from the info bars in this feature. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellafor Maghera in the final. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

In an extensive interview this weeks County Derry Post, the former Kingdom and Hogan Cup winning boss gives a Kerry slant to a feature on the minor clashes with Derry from  to . Derry have lost the services of Conor Glass and Callum Brown since minor level, with former U player Anton Tohill also lost to the AFL. Current Derry captain Chrissy McKaigue had a stint with Sydney Swans, and more recently Conleth McShane attended a AFL combine in Dublin before Christmas. googletag.cmd.push It was the same one Tohill and Oisin McWilliams attended two years ago. McWilliams later spent time in Australia with North Melbourne, in , but wasnt snapped up. Kerrys  goalkeeper Deividas Uosis and  winning captain Mark OConnor, both past pupils of Fitzmaurice have travelled down under, but their prize asset – David Clford – has stayed put. “It wasnt on his radar,” reveals Fitzmaurice of a meeting they had when he was senior manager. “He had no interest in going to Australia, or anywhere . Id say there were definitely approaches made but he wanted to play for Kerry and win All-Irelands with Kerry.” googletag.cmd.push On the flip side, Kerry lost OConnor to the AFL. He won two Hogan Cup medals under Fitzmaurice in Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. “He is a great guy and a big loss to Kerry,” Eacuteamonn states. “He got made an offer and decided to avail of it. From a Kerry perspective, it is up to us to make sure the players want to stay for the right reason. “If they do stay, they get a good education. There is a good job for them and they are well looked after to allow them to pursue an amateur sport. “Rather than giving out about it, it is always important to look in the mirror...is there anything we can do that would make a players le a bit easierthey do stay at home. David wanted to stay at home and we are delighted that he did.” Playing inter-county doesnt pay the bills, but Fitzmaurice sees a bigger picture. “When you are the manager of Kerry, thats what you want – for the players - to ensure the were happy in their personal and professional lives every bit as much as they are in their football lives. “If they are happy in their personal and professional lives, iniably they are going to be better footballers for it. Its not jobs for the boys, what you are trying to do is to encourage players to get a good education, to go down a route that they are interested in, so they can build a good career as well as being a successful footballer.” RELATED - Tohill waiting to make his mark.

The company has confirmed it has started to unfurlough some of its staff this week to prepare to reopen the majority of its six stores in Northern Ireland, including the store at a business park in the Waterside. Homeware was included in the list of businesses permitted to remain open under the legal restrictions which came into law in Northern Ireland on March . The regulations in England were subsequently updated on May  to include homeware as an essential business, prompting Matalan to begin a phased reopening of its English outlets. The company initially furloughed  staff in the north, but it has now confirmed that it will reopen its stores in Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push A Matalan spokesperson said:“Following the change in government guidance to include Homeware as essential retail on May st, Matalan, as a Clothing and Homeware Retailer with a signicant Homeware business,has been preparing carefully for asafe andphased re-opening stores, culminating in the successful re-opening of a select group of trial stores in England in recent weeks.

Staying connected with their teacher daily, has allowed the children to still tap into a iety of rich learning experiences. St Mary’s have been involved with Ronan McLaughlin of Sustrans NI this year and it has continued during lockdown. His challenges incorporated into their weekly timetables for online learning. Things shted to a dferent realm after Mr Gregory Brunton posted Conans fabulous design for a cycling jersey, a design task as part of the weekly challenges, on Twitter last week. googletag.cmd.push In a matter of hours, his clever creation sent the cycling world all over Europe and far beyond, into a frenzy. Former professional cyclist and current sports presenter Daniel Lloyd called for the jersey to be made. Eurosport presenter Orla Chennaoui, a past pupil of St Mary’s, was ready to place her order. In no time, French blogger Justin Velo brought the design to le, prompting an increase in demand for the jersey to be made. Interest flooded in from all over the world. Conan had his hands full communicating with admirers from far and wide. Offers flooded in from a number of interested sporting bodies, wanting to bring his topical cycling jersey to le. googletag.cmd.push Conan is thrilled to announce that the famous sports design company Pactimo will produce his cycling jersey. Their clothing is worn by professional athletes, national champions and Olympians. Principal Corinne Coyle assures us, they are in good company with our Conan! “I was so excited when my jersey was being retweeted by so many people,” Conan told the County Derry Post “When I was designing the top, I thought the Covid- message, Keep your distance would be equally good for cyclists, as I know they often worry about how close motorists get to them when they are out on the roads. “So, as well as saving lives against the virus, the message could also save lives on our roads. My sister Cadhla is looking for some credit, as I used her markers to colour the jersey!” Pactimo have agreed to initially make two copies of the original design, one for Conan and one for the school. Exciting discussions are currently underway with Pactimo to decide how this brilliant design can best reach a wider audience and benefit others in the process.

Staying connected with their teacher daily, has allowed the children to still tap into a iety of rich learning experiences. St Mary’s have been involved with Ronan McLaughlin of Sustrans NI this year and it has continued during lockdown. His challenges incorporated into their weekly timetables for online learning. Things shted to a dferent realm after Mr Gregory Brunton posted Conans fabulous design for a cycling jersey, a design task as part of the weekly challenges, on Twitter last week. googletag.cmd.push In a matter of hours, his clever creation sent the cycling world all over Europe and far beyond, into a frenzy. Former professional cyclist and current sports presenter Daniel Lloyd called for the jersey to be made. Eurosport presenter Orla Chennaoui, a past pupil of St Mary’s, was ready to place her order. In no time, French blogger Justin Velo brought the design to le, prompting an increase in demand for the jersey to be made. Interest flooded in from all over the world. Conan had his hands full communicating with admirers from far and wide. Offers flooded in from a number of interested sporting bodies, wanting to bring his topical cycling jersey to le. googletag.cmd.push Conan is thrilled to announce that the famous sports design company Pactimo will produce his cycling jersey. Their clothing is worn by professional athletes, national champions and Olympians. Principal Corinne Coyle assures us, they are in good company with our Conan! “I was so excited when my jersey was being retweeted by so many people,” Conan told the County Derry Post “When I was designing the top, I thought the Covid- message, Keep your distance would be equally good for cyclists, as I know they often worry about how close motorists get to them when they are out on the roads. “So, as well as saving lives against the virus, the message could also save lives on our roads. My sister Cadhla is looking for some credit, as I used her markers to colour the jersey!” Pactimo have agreed to initially make two copies of the original design, one for Conan and one for the school. Exciting discussions are currently underway with Pactimo to decide how this brilliant design can best reach a wider audience and benefit others in the process. As this project continues to unfold, excitement is at an all-time high at St Mary’s PS Draperstowns Learning Hub.

Causeway Coast and Glens Council is to furlough  staff, with Belfast and Lisburn and Castlereagh councils yet to make a decision.Elsewhere, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council has not yet finalised its number with estimates that it could be as many as , with suggestions that Ards and North Down Council will furlough around  staff.While Newry, Mourne and Down Council is continuing to maintain essential frontline services, including refuse collection and street cleansing, the majority of others have been suspended.There are also fears that these particular services are unlikely to resume until after final stage of the Stormont Executiversquos recovery plan is implemented, with the dficulty that there is no time frame in place at this stage.But there was some good news for the local council with confirmation that a poundm funding package has been made available by the Department for Communities.The money mdash which is being shared by Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash is to help them deal with financial pressures as a result of the pandemic and ensure that they can continue to provide essential services and support those in need.Local authorities are mainly funded through district rates, but the cash this raises is to fall dramatically in the short term due to rates holidays, while other council income from leisure centres and community facilities has been decimated by the lockdown.Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said the new funding will assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of vital services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 August.jpg","title":"August at the earliest for Downpatrick racing date  ","story":"IRISH horse racing is set to resume behind closed doors on June  with only key personnel being permitted to attend.The last meeting before the closedown took place on March , while the last local meeting was the Randox Ulster National at Downpatrick on Sunday, March .This means that Downpatrick has lost its two May meetings and with flat racing being prioritised for the first month, the popular local venue will also lose its two mid-June fixtures, as no flat racing takes place at the venue.Downpatrick manager Richard Lyttle, hopes that the track will still be able to race on the two August dates, one of which is the very popular Bank Holiday Ladiesrsquo Day meeting, but sadly the family day in July will not happen this year.Downpatrick doesnrsquot race from October until March, butthings get back to normal perhaps they may be able to get a new date.Back in the  point-to-point season the North Down meeting took place at Mount Alexander, Comber, on Tuesday, April .It is a meeting that means a lot these days to top local amateur rider, Mark OrsquoHare, as it was at this popular venue, owned by Alex Murdoch, that he recorded his first ever winner.After winning on Ringneill, owned by Miss Siobhan MacKinnon at this seasonrsquos Armagh meeting, Mark set a record by riding a winner in every season since that initial success.The Banbridge farrier, who worked in the building trade back in the Nineties, was successful on Cinders Slipper, owned by Bishopscourt man Scobie Curran and trained by Newryrsquos Liam Lennon, in the Michael OrsquoGrady Memorial Mares Maiden.Liam fell in the race on Cathal McGovernrsquos Copper Denel, which he also trained. Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue.

I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes.

I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point.

But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown.

Just recently, Gerry made it back to the top of the famous landmark again mdash only this time he did it from the comfort of his own home.A decade ago, Gerry enjoyed good health and loved every minute of his visit to France but in  Loughinisland GACrsquos hard-working secretary contracted lung cancer, having never smoked a day in his le.In September that year, surgeons removed one of his lungs and between then and Christmas Gerry received chemotherapy treatment to assist his road to recovery.As a result of his illness, he was referred to Macmillanrsquos lsquoMove Morersquo initiative at Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick, which is specically designed to help people to get active and stay active with physical activity during and after most types of cancer treatment.Under the watchful eye of initiative co-ordinator Laura McGrath, Gerry loved the camaraderie of being with others referred by medical staff to take part in physical activity which can help educe the side effects of treatment, prevent the occurrence of other long-term conditions and reduce the risk of cancer spreading or ing.ldquoThere were just four of us at the start, recalled Gerry. ldquoWe started off in the old leisure centre which was subsequently replaced by a more modern building and there are now around  people who take part.ldquoWe all look forward to the classes every Thursday morning and after our warm-up routine we then proceed around a circuit and spend time on ious equipment, including a rowing machine. We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did.

It will mean people can enjoy an evening together while still maintaining social distancing in the comfort of their own car.As a start, Cllr Devlin is keen to see a drive-in cinema in Newcastle to mark the start of her year in office.She explained that this would allow the local authority to gauge its success and how it complements the legislation on social distancing.ldquoHopefully after this, we may be in a position to roll this venture out across the entire district over the course of the year and include all our towns, said Cllr Devlin.ldquoAlready, this idea has gained a lot of support from local people which I think is a testament to the need that currently exists within all of us to connect and eventually interact with our family and friends once more.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThe test of how we unlock this will be in how we can continue to adhere to essential government guidelines on social distancing and ultimately defeating this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Paul.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul running in aid of MYMY  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man who has been running five kilometres every day since the beginning of the lockdown has raised over pound, for a local mental health charity.Paul Tumelty found himself with more time on his hands when the seaside coffee shop he worked in was forced to close its doors under government guidelines to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.The  year-old father of two, says he never thought of running until he saw a Facebook post from Mind Your Mate and Yourself , stating that the charity was struggling financially.It was forecasting ain income of pound, because of the cancellation or postponement of fundraising events.Paul, who has suffered from mental health issues, realised the importance of the charity after experiencing a number of family tragedies and decided he would help raise money to help them bridge the deficit.ldquoI always need to be doing something.

recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

scheduled for Down Royal on July .Downpatrickrsquos last meeting was the prestigious Ulster National meeting on March .Racecourse manager Richard Lyttle said it was a very dferent race day experience than would normally be the case.ldquoIn normal circumstances we would have had a large crowd, since it is our flagship meeting of the year, he said.ldquoOnly industry officials, jockeys and trainers were allowed to attend, so we had around  people there in total.Commenting on theof racing, he said: ldquoIt is great to see the resumption of Irish racing in June. It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up.

Clubhouses remained closed and no visitors are permitted.Tennis clubs have also been given permission to re-open, again subject to protocols being put into operation.However, other sports remain shut down.Restrictions on Gaelic games are likely to stay in place until July  and there will be no inter-county games until October at the earliest.The start to the cricket season has been delayed, but this week the Northern Cricket Union said it hoped to be in a position soon to announce the first step in ato training..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Restrictions.jpg","title":"Restrictions begin to ease  ","story":"THERE will be a major easing of lockdown restrictions across the district from today.A number of country parks, harbours, tennis courts and beach car parks will be reopened by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, but strict social distancing measures remain in place with the local authority warning thatthey are not observed, the facilities will be closed.The move to ease some lockdown measures comes after the local authority recently reopened the districtrsquos household recycling centres.But despite the easing of some measures, council campsites, public toilets and cafeacutes across the district remain closed, while mobile vendors are also banned from trading at beaches and forest parks.At last weekrsquos online meeting between the councilrsquos senior management team and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties, agreement to start easing some of the lockdown measures was agreed.Also from today, mountain bike and horse riding trails and the car parks at Castlewellan Forest Park and Tollymore Forest Park will reopen.Public access to the forest parks was agreed two weeks ago, but the car parks remained closed, sparking complaints from residents who live close to both facilities about the number of cars parked along approach roads, hampering sight lines which posed a health and safety risk.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is taking direction from the Northern Ireland Executive on how it slowly starts to ease the lockdown, insisting that progress is determined by public health advice.Two weeks ago, the NI Executive published a five-phase blueprint for lting restrictions but it did not include a timeframe, insisting that it will be guided by scientic and medical advice before it agrees to lt any further restrictions.Local politicians say that they are keen to seen the pathway to recovery progressed, but are reluctant to move too quickly as the virus still has a presence.They are also conscious that with the warm weather predicted to stay, soaring temperatures could place pressure on the districtrsquos hotspots where visitor numbers could increase, as was the case in Newcastle last weekend.With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family are allowed indoors where social distancing is possible, with churches permitted to open for private prayer, with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces.However, with groups of four to six people who do not share a household now able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, the local authority feels it is time to allow access to beaches, country parks, harbours and tennis courts.Politicians say they are conscious that easing the lockdown restrictions in one go could push up the all-important R-number, which measures the average rate of transmission.Councillors say the last thing they want is for a situation to arise which would result in having to reimpose lockdown measures and lose the hard won gains that have been made to date.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke and his Rowallane counterpart, Billy Walker, have welcomed the progress being made, but issued a reminder that there will be no leguard facilities at Tyrella beach. However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

However, for some reason that warning was not included in the inquiry’s letter to the two men.For instance, in the written questions sent to former DUP minister Jonathan Bell he was told: “It is vital that the witness statement you provide to the inquiry is your own evidence, absent the influence of others ...”He was also told – as were many other witnesses – that “you may share the correspondence and the enclosed notice with your legal representative, but neither you nor they may show, communicate the contents of, nor provide this correspondence or the notice to any other person or organisation without the express permission of the RHI Inquiry. Any breach of this duty of confidentiality is actionable at the suit of the inquiry chairman”.Mr Bell, again in common with many witnesses, did not receive an offer to meet the solicitor to the inquiry, Patrick Butler.However, in his letters to Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, Mr Butler said: “If it would assist you, I am happy to meet with youto discuss the requirements of the Section  Notice and what evidence you may be able to provide which is within the scope of the Section  Notice.”By contrast to the identical evidence provided by Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, when Sinn Fein ‘super spad’ Aidan McAteer was asked some of the same questions, his answers were worded dferently – as were those of the spad to then finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, Eoin Rooney.The questions to all of the Sinn Fein figures had been around an Ofgem employee, Edd Fyffe, who had contacted Sinn Fein in January  and presented himself as a whistleblower, setting out a series of allegations against Ofgem, which runs RHI for Stormont.Each of the republicans said that they had handled his allegations appropriately and neither they nor Mr Fyffe were called to give oral evidence to the inquiry.The News Letter asked whether Mr Howell or Mr Lynch discussed with each other how they would respond to the inquiry and,not,how they could explain the remarkable similarity between their answers.At the time of going to press, there had been no response, despite repeated requests for comment.Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, along with veteran IRA man Padraic Wilson, had been the triumvirate of senior republicans to whom Mr Ó Muilleoir passed a series of complex policy decisions around RHI – even though none of them are energy experts, lawyers or serve as spads who are bound by civil service codes.Amid alarm from senior civil servants, Mr Ó Muilleoir had asked Mr Howell: “Would you be contentI were to sign off on the business plan on Wednesday afternoon ”The former finance minister insisted that he had been merely consulting the influential republican close to Gerry Adams and not seeking his consent to the plan for retrospective cost controls.However, the RHI Inquiry ruled that was not what had happened and Mr Ó Muilleoir had indeed asked for the publicly unaccountable republican’s consent for the massive decision.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting the cheque for £, to Jane McKimm, Head of Communications, and Helen ONeill, Director of Finance.at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, for specic use at Craigavon Area Hospital : Other rd

included preparing food hampers for elderly and vulnerable brethren, and others in the community, making donations of food and goodies to frontline hospital staff, making monetary donations to charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area

Facebook being between  and over ,.”He added: “The museum at Sloan’s House was very proud to display the Grand Lodge banner of support for the NHS and other frontline services on the front of the building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

virtually.By The NewsroomThursday, th May , : pm\"\"The proposal to look at the feasibility of hosting certain events remotely was raised at Tuesday evening’s virtual meeting as members discussed a report recommending all Council led events are cancelled until the end of August.Council’s Head of Tourism, Artsand Culture, Brian Johnston, advised members there will be a further report in June that will give consideration to events held until the end of December .The report, circulated to members before the meeting, states that at present, events involving gatherings of people are not permitted and it is anticipated that when they are, other controls such as social distancing will be required.Some of the events recommended for cancellation include Buskfest in Banbridge Town Centre on June , Armed Forces Day in Banbridge Town Centre and Rugby Club on June  and the Seven Hills Blues Festival in Armagh which runs from August -.Other events for later in the year, including the Georgian Festival in Armagh and Halloween events across the borough and Christmas and twilight markets are all marked for further consideration.When asked by Banbridge Sinn Fein councillor, Kevin Savage why an estimate of council savings was not includedin the report Mr Johnston said Council would have spent £, on the events it now proposes to cancel.However, he did advise that not all of that will be saved by Council as some contractual obligations will need to be met.SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon raisedthe possibility of holding some of these events virtually.“We are encouraging businesses to do things online,” said the Armagh representative.“If we could look at some of these events happening between now and Christmas and seethere is an opportunity to do similar with them, could we have that explored and brought back in due course ”Lurgan councillor Liam Mackle said: “I would be very happy with some virtual events taking place in the months ahead.”The Sinn Fein representative then proposed that Council officers explore this idea and report back in due course with the proposal seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading
