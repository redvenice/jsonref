He has long campaigned for a register of overseas entities requiring foreign owners of property in the UK to declare their true identity, which is only now being brought forward as part of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill.Other measures contained in the legislation, which went through the Commons in a day, include removing barriers to using unexplained wealth orders and strengthening the sanctions regime.Lord Faulks said: \u0027We of course understand why this Bill is being rushed through Parliament, but what I fail to understand is why the Government has taken so long to respond to what what was staring them in the face.\u0027 He added: \u0027We have allowed ourselves to be the receiver of stolen goods in this country.\u0027Lord Faulks referred to former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko who died in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210, while the Salisbury chemical weapons attack in 2018 killed Dawn Sturgess.He said: \u0027Reputable sources suggest that as many as 10 or more murders are attributable to Russia. Ukraine is not our fault, but we have embraced the Russian oligarchs and the henchmen of Putin.\u0027 He added: \u0027It (the Bill) contains some useful provisions and I thoroughly support them. They can no doubt be improved when the next Bill, comes along, but it should never have been necessary to come to this.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Hermes change Evri invest 7m employee pensions","story":"Share this articleHermes hopes rebrand will deliver a better reputation | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Rihannas lingerie brand Savage X Fenty working IPO value company 3bn","story":"Share this articleBloomberg - Are you a robot?SAVAGE X FENTY | Lingerie by RihannaRihanna and LVMH Hit Pause on Fenty, Their Fashion Line - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Tube rail strikes continue London Underground","story":"Share this articlePicket lines were mounted outside Tube stations and the union said its members were solidly supporting the industrial action.Key workers and hospital patients were caught up in the mayhem as passengers tried to board packed buses. Underground staff are protesting over fears of staff cuts and changes to work conditions and pension schemes as TfL looks to recover from the pandemic.In another blow for travellers, Uber users were hit by hiked fares as they were forced to turn to the app amid transport chaos.Prices were around double, with a normal taxi from Kennington to Kensington costing £25 and one from Kensington to Tooting hitting £20.And roads were clogged up with vehicles as those who would usually get the Tube to work took to taxis, buses and cars. Boris Johnson demanded an end to the chaos after stepping in and ordering TfL and union bosses to stop \u0027bringing misery to Londoners\u0027.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: \u0027I think these ongoing strikes clearly are bringing misery to many Londoners, and we want both sides to get around the table and put an end to this disruptive action.\u0027It\u0027s a blow to businesses as they recover from Covid restrictions and it\u0027s stopping people from getting to work.\u0027Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was also critical, as he tweeted: \u0027For the 2nd time this week, @TfL tube strikes have brought London to a standstill.\u0027Given the government has provided almost £5bn to protect services \u0026amp TfL jobs throughout the pandemic, this is no way to repay hard-pressed taxpayers who are simply trying to get to work \u0026amp home.\u0027Tory MP Greg Smith, who sits on the Commons transport committee, said: \u0027It\u0027s wholly unacceptable for people\u0027s daily lives, their income, their livelihoods to be disrupted in this horrendous way. \u0027It\u0027s literally taking food off people\u0027s tables.

The reality is tough. Sport at a high level is so difficult.”“Selhurst Park is always a difficult place to go,” the Spaniard said. “It is a final for us and we know it. Hopefully we can prepare well to arrive on Monday in good shape to face the opponent. “Always in my mind when we start to play the last 10 games of the Premier League every game is a final. When you have to play 55 games it is not a final but when you have 10 games left it is a final.”They were also asked about the Chelsea fans chanting the name of Roman Abramovich at Norwich on Thursday night: Allan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton are both injury doubts for Newcastle.“He was really frustrated but he managed to get back on the field and his work ethic is unbelievable. He is a young player who wants to spend time on the field and wants to improve himself. He is in a really good place – playing well, enjoying his football, and it is good for the team.”While Conte has voiced his horror at the war and Russia’s actions, the Spurs manager says the impact on sporting stars is “very sad” given the dedication it takes to get to the highest level. “You have to pay for this situation, I think it’s not right. Honestly, I hoped the situation is going to be solved, because it’s creating a lot of damage. We’re in 2022 and to see this is horrible for everybody.” Conte was a former employee of Roman Abramovich and said: “We are talking about four or five years ago. At the time, Chelsea, also now, we’re talking about a fantastic club. With an owner that made this club big. Don’t forget that in the period he was the owner, Chelsea won everything. But it was for Chelsea. I think also we have seen other Russia owners in other teams. Not only in football but in many sports.”On Mo Salah’s contract talks, the Liverpool manager is asked whether the signing of Luis Diaz might convince the Egypt forward to sign a new deal. “I think Mo expects this club to be ambitious but it’s not about that, it’s a decision for Mo, it’s all fine with Mo at the moment from my point of view, nothing further has happened, so we’ll just have to wait for that – there’s no rush.”Here’s our story: “The uncertainty over the current ownership situation of Chelsea FC has been challenging,” Trivago said in a statement. “Moving forward, it is important to us to continue supporting the club, the fans and community along with the essential work that the Chelsea Foundation does to help those in need. We are looking forward to a transition of ownership as soon as possible and want to support the club in this process. We will provide any update to our business relationship if and when appropriate. “As a company of global citizens, we cannot condone the unprovoked and catastrophic invasion of Ukraine. We believe in a free world, freedom of speech and peace. We continue our efforts together with our teams to support the humanitarian efforts and to ease the suffering of the affected population. We stand with Ukraine.”City are hoping Nathan Ake and João Cancelo are fit after missing the Champions League nonevent against Sporting Lisbon through injury and illness respectively. Kyle Walker is also back in contention after being suspended for the Sporting game but Ruben Dias (thigh) is still out. For Palace Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has impressed of late, could again start up front while Joel Ward (groin) and Nathan Ferguson (hamstring) are set to miss out once again. James McArthur is also still absent with a knock after just completing his return from a hamstring problem.The American businessman Adam Binnie, whose family have made two bids for the club, told the BBC on Thursday that administrators had rejected their most recent bid of £30m and would not speak to them again unless they increased their offer. But administrators Quantuma said on Friday that there is still interest in buying the club. “The joint administrators are continuing to work with prospective purchasers who remain interested in buying the club,” the administrators’ statement said.“It is our duty to secure an appropriate valuation for Derby County and to ensure we have a suitable bid to present to the EFL.” They added that they wished to assure supporters that “discussions with interested parties are ongoing and focused on making the club financially sustainable for the long term”. The EFL said on 3 March 3 it had received assurances from the administrators that sufficient funds were in place to see out the season. The Binnie family has no appetite to increase its offer.“An index that uses the vast sums of funds from the TV revenues to reward well-run clubs, clubs that are financially sustainable and can survive without an owner benefactor.” Bowen has undergone scans but the club are still in the dark about the extent of the problem. “I have no idea at the moment,” said Moyes. “We’re still trying to clear up exactly the injury. In all the scans and information we have it does not look too bad, but his action coming off the pitch at Anfield made it look more serious than we thought. And that has not added up. “Since then Jarrod is slightly improving but not as fast as we hoped. We did not think it was anything serious. So we are still trying to get to the bottom of it.”On the pitch of course, Chelsea shrugged it all off with comfortable wins last night for their men at Norwich and their women at West Ham and Thomas Tuchel tried to put a brave face on it all by insisting it was “business as usual”. You can read all about the reaction here, Sean Ingle on what it all means here, and there’s a must-read from David Conn here on how the game turned a blind eye for years on the source of Abramovich’s wealth and power. And wouldn’t you know it, Chelsea’s opponents this weekend are Newcastle, who in a more ethically and properly regulated game wouldn’t have the owners they currently do either. Ah, the beautiful game.  On the field, there are only three Premier League matches on Saturday, with a relegation battle between Brentford and Burnley and a top-four tussle between Manchester United and Tottenham the picks.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe representative body for petrol stations and fuel providers has accused the Government of “misleading” the public into believing that the price of fuel would drop as soon as excise duty cuts came into effect. Excise reductions of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent for diesel came into effect after midnight on Wednesday as part of Government efforts to curb a sharp increase in fuel costs linked to the war in Ukraine.Fuel providers received sharp criticism as prices for petrol and diesel failed to drop on Thursday. Kevin McPartlan, chief executive of Fuels for Ireland, said it was “misleading” to suggest providers had been “engaged in any sort of profiteering”. “These times are made even more challenging when misleading comments find their way into the public domain,” he wrote. The industry representative said the Government had given the public the “false impression” that prices at the pump would reduce as soon as the excise cuts came into effect. “This was simply never going to be the case, and was flagged in advance, given that excise has already been paid on supplies presently on forecourts,” he said. “It has given people a false impression that prices would reduce immediately, which was impossible as excise on those supplies had already been paid,” he wrote. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has been called on to investigate alleged price-gouging by fuel providers before the excise cuts came into effect, with Opposition and Government TDs criticising the increases. The consumer watchdog has said there were “no legal barriers” to filling stations independently raising prices, and it required evidence of cartel behaviour before launching an investigation.‘Morally reprehensible’Ministers are to meet Mr McPartlan and executives from several fuel providers on Friday afternoon. It is expected the meeting will be attended by Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath, Minister of State for Enterprise Robert Troy, and Minister of State for Retail Damien English. Speaking at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday evening, Mr Martin said reported profiteering around rising fuel prices was “completely unacceptable,” and any exploitation of the war in Ukraine was “morally reprehensible”. In his correspondence to Mr Martin afterwards, Mr McPartlan said the comments were of “great concern” and that the suggestions petrol stations were profiteering was “offensive”. The industry would “continue to transact our business ethically and in an open and transparent fashion,” he said. It would also defend itself against “faulty assumptions as to our industry’s ethics of operation,” he said.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney on Friday said the Government would do everything in its power to assist society, particularly the vulnerable, with increasing fuel, bread and oil heating prices. More than awareIn an interview on the Opinion Line on Cork’s 96FM, the Minister said he and the Coalition were conscious of soaring prices. “We will respond to that as best we can. And that is why there were social welfare increases, there were fuel allowance increases, there was a living alone allowance increase, there was a tax package which was targeting low to middle income earners,” he said. “I am not saying that is enough. What I am saying is that the Government is more than aware of the pressures people are under and is responding to that and will continue to respond to that.”He said fuel costs were “a hugely political issue and I think companies will be under intense scrutiny. “And so they should be at a time when price inflation is as high as it is at the moment. We are encouraging the industry to get prices down,” he said.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"north korea tests intercontinental ballistic missile as leader expands space effort","story":"The Hwasong-17 would be North Korea’s longest-range weapon, carried on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, with some analysts calling it a ‘monster’. Photograph: Korean Central News AgencyKorea News Service via APNorth Korea recently used what would be its largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system in two secretive launches, likely paving the way for a resumption of long-range tests, US and South Korean officials said.North Korea froze its ICBM and nuclear tests in 2017 after launching its first missiles capable of reaching the United States. It has also not tested a nuclear weapon since then but leader Kim Jong Un has warned of a return to testing both.The escalation in North Korea tensions comes as South Korea on Wednesday elected a new conservative president.Yoon Suk-yeol has said preemptive strikes may be needed to counter any imminent attack by the North and has vowed to buy American THAAD missile interceptors, while remaining open to restarting stalled denuclearisation talks.TestsIn launches on February 27th and March 5th, North Korea did not specify what missile was used, but said they tested components for reconnaissance satellites Kim said would soon be launched to monitor military activity by the United States and its allies.“The purpose of these tests, which did not demonstrate ICBM range, was likely to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future, potentially disguised as a space launch,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.The US Treasury, which has imposed a range of sanctions on North Korea over its weapons programmes, will announce new actions on Friday to help prevent North Korea “accessing foreign items and technology that enable it to advance its weapons programmes,” a senior US administration official told reporters in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.These steps would be followed by a range of further actions in coming days, the official added, without giving any details of the measures.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Yoon said they had agreed to ramp up three-way ties with the United States in responding to North Korea’s evolving military threat.Japan is also considering imposing additional sanctions against North Korea, as well as other diplomatic options, Kishida told reporters after a phone call with the South Korean president-elect.MissilesThe United States and South Korea both said the missile system, known as the Hwasong-17, was unveiled at an October 2020 military parade in Pyongyang and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021.The Hwasong-17 would be North Korea’s longest-range weapon, carried on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, with some analysts calling it a “monster”.Analysts said the tests likely used only one stage of the Hwasong-17, and may have adjusted its fuel use to fly at lower altitudes.Washington called the ICBM tests a “serious escalation requiring a united global response”. Seoul issued strong condemnation and urged Pyongyang to immediately stop actions that heighten tension.The intelligence assessments, released simultaneously by the United States and South Korea, came as North Korean state media reported Kim had inspected the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground.The facility has been used to put a satellite in orbit and also to test various missile components including rocket engines and space launch vehicles that South Korean and US. officials say require similar technology to that used in ICBMs.North Korea “has historically used its space launches to try to hide its attempted advancements of its ICBM programme”, the US official told reporters.At the Sohae station, Kim inspected facilities and ordered modernising and expanding it to ensure that “various rockets could be launched to carry multi-purpose satellites, including a military reconnaissance satellite,” the North’s KCNA news agency reported.“I think that the North Koreans are genuinely working on a set of technologies that have applications across both ICBMs and satellites,” said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US – based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.South Korea’s unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said it was monitoring Kim’s movements and urged North Korea to refrain from further stoking tension.Stay on top of the latest news with our

may never be resolved, a report from the Whitehall spending watchdog has warned.In a scathing report, the National Audit Office (NAO) said that the £5.5 billion project was “flawed from the start”, and that the Ministry of Defence failed to understand the scale and complexity of the work it was undertaking.It added that delays to the programme, which is already more than four years behind schedule, could now jeopardise plans to restructure the Army around a new generation of digitally enabled armoured fighting vehicles.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “A series of failures have led to delays and unresolved safety issues that will have a significant impact on the Army’s ability to use the vehicles.”Ministers publicly acknowledged last year that the programme was in trouble. They included problems with excessive noise and vibration, which have left dozens of troops needing urgent hearing assessments after taking part in trials on the vehicles.General Dynamics UK was contracted to supply 589 Ajax armoured vehicles, which were originally supposed to enter service in 2017. However, despite receiving more than £3 billion, only 26 have been delivered so far.Vibration issues ‘pose a significant risk’The NAO said that the concerns about noise and vibration have still to be resolved, and continued to represent a “significant risk” to the programme.While trials with Army crews have been halted, the NAO said that the company has continued production without receiving any payment in 2021.However, the Ministry of Defence has yet to set a revised date to get the first tranche into service and has no confidence that an April 2025 target date for the full operating capability can be met.The Army has to rely on its ageing fleet of Warrior armoured fighting vehicles as a result.“It is not yet clear whether the programme’s issues are resolvable,” the NAO said.‘Everything that can go wrong did go wrong’Dame Meg Hillier, the chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: “The NAO report reads like a checklist for major project failure where almost everything that can go wrong did go wrong.“It means Ajax has now joined the sorry pantheon of government projects which have gone off the tracks.”She added: “The Army is forced to continue using increasingly old and obsolete equipment which, aside from adding cost, reduces our capability at a time when dangers are only increasing.“Both parties must find a way out of the deadlock, work together to rescue the programme and ensure the Army gets the equipment it needs.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin says there are \u0026#39certain positive shifts\u0026#39 in talks with UkrainePolitics latest news: Almost 400 Russian politicians banned from UK in new round of sanctionsWatch: Kamala Harris laughs during press conference on Ukrainian refugeesUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as psychiatric hospital bombedPsychiatric hospital hit by Russian forces in eastern UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must bankrupt russia stopping oil gas sales readers weeks top","story":"On Tuesday, the US and the UK both announced that they would ban Russian oil imports in an attempt to increase the financial pressure on the Kremlin.

Of course we don’t know if the gas is really there and we don’t know if it is commercially viable (although with present prices it must be) we don’t know how large the vibrations will be and we don’t know if the water table will be affected by pollution. This culpable ignorance is the Government’s fault.\u0027An embargo may now be moot\u0027@Ivor Stuart:One of the few times, Mr Evans-Pritchard, that I\u0027m not sure you\u0027re right. An embargo may now be moot, with Putin\u0027s hand on the oil, gas and wheat taps. He\u0027ll get by. Russians tend to be hardier than those west of Russia except maybe the ex-comecon states.If the gasoilwheat supplies stop, it\u0027ll cripple far more than Russians. Let\u0027s see what people think when 1 litre petrol costs £3, a loaf of bread about the same and anything otherwise dependent on any of these commodities rise sharply in price. As commented often here, western governments were too slow to take in the implications.\u0027Britain’s electricity system is vulnerable to outages now\u0027@Kathryn Porter, London E1:SIR – Special interest groups are loudly lobbying for their preferred solution, but many of these will take years of development and are not helpful in the short term.Britain’s electricity system is vulnerable to outages now. Winter capacity margins are very narrow and when low winds combine with increasingly common nuclear outages as the fleet ages, we face real threats to security of supply.There are steps that can be taken to address this in the short term. We should delay the closure of coal-fired power stations, at least until Hinkley Point C opens. We should also ensure that gas generation resources are optimised, with mothballed plants returned to service. We should negotiate firm gas-supply contracts with producing nations, and suspend renewables subsidies in favour of a major retrofit effort to reduce heat losses in homes.Looking to the longer-term future, we should expand domestic gas production and secure new nuclear projects, preferably technologies, such as advanced boiling water reactors. These reactors have been built in four years, while EDF’s technology takes at least a decade to build.Volodymyr Zelensky vows to fight Russians in \u0027forests, fields and on shores\u0027 The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, delivered a historical speech via video link to the House of Commons packed with MP’s and the Prime Minister. President Zelensky promised to combat the Russians \u0027in forests, fields and on shores,\u0027 while praising Western countries for executing sanctions.  readers shared their thoughts on Mr Zelensky’s speech with many wishing him well.\u0027The man has the courage of a lion\u0027@Alternative Thinker:You may not agree with Zelensky but the man has the courage of a lion. He could have taken the US offer and been whisked out of the country, but his immortal reply was \u0027I don\u0027t need a ride, I need more ammunition\u0027.\u0027Is he willing to compromise to some extent to save lives?\u0027@Margaret de Rohan:Is he actually brave? Certainly he is an inspirational leader but I worry about his rather gung-ho rhetoric. Obviously he has his own agenda and wants the best for Ukraine. But what’s the best for the world, and world peace? That’s the dilemma. Is he willing to compromise to some extent to save lives? Pray for a peaceful resolution.\u0027Ukraine has the world’s backing\u0027@Scott Johnson:The Ukrainian people need to hold their nerve - Russia cannot win this war. The current war footing is unsustainable and they will never gain control of a resisting population. All Putin has achieved is to embolden Europe and alienate Russia from the rest of the world.The operation itself hasn’t been planned well and I doubt that he had impressed his Chinese allies with the current state of play either. Ukraine has the world’s backing and will win this in the end.Ukraine’s women are showing the world what real bravery looks likeThe women of Ukraine including Ukrainian MP, Kira Rudik, have made this year’s International Women’s Day memorable worldwide as they take to the streets of Kyiv protecting their land, making moves to resist Putin’s invasion. Our readers shared their thoughts, many describing these women’s bravery and fearlessness as an act of heroism.\u0027I salute these women\u0027@Anne Morton:I salute these women. I hope if I was ever in a similar situation I\u0027d dig deep, find some courage and do the same.All I can do is donate money and pray. I hope the money gets what is needed. That stands more chance of being useful than praying but I’m willing to do that too,  just in case.\u0027It’s a pity western forces in Afghanistan didn’t train the women\u0027@Shirley Pierechod:As my husband observes, it\u0027s a pity that the western forces in Afghanistan didn\u0027t train the women of that poor country, as they most definitely had a great deal more to lose than the men. Sadly, they\u0027ve lost everything gained in the previous years.The Ukrainian women who stay are so courageous, whether with weapons in their hands, or not.\u0027There’s a vital difference between words and action\u0027@J Murray:On the day the Russians invaded I received this message from a woman, a very dear friend, in Ukraine: \u0027We shall defend our land. We shall never surrender.\u0027My God. She has proved that there is such a vital difference between just mere words and action. My love is with her and her brave comrades in arms.John Bercow banned from Parliament after inquiry brands him \u0027serial bully\u0027A 22-month investigation into claims against John Bercow dating back 12 years concluded that he should be banned for life from holding a parliamentary security pass, preventing him from having free access to the Palace of Westminster. Readers discussed how Mr Bercow came across in the House of Commons and the effect of bullying in the workplace.\u0027He patronised, mocked and belittled MPs\u0027@Bruce Burniston:Ill-treating those who cannot answer back is contemptible behaviour. We saw it occur almost daily when he was in the Speaker\u0027s chair. He patronised, mocked and belittled MPs, who could not answer back without retribution. I remember seeing the same treatment being meted out to the media in the street during the Brexit saga. Given his accusations against the inquiry, including calling it a \u0027kangaroo court\u0027 shows that he has no remorse.\u0027He wasn’t an independent speaker when it came to the EU\u0027@Mark Staff:Bullying is a terrible thing, there certainly seems to be sufficient evidence to bring suspicion and from multiple sources.Regardless of the guilty findings, the quote on Bercow from the independent body, is pretty damning alone: \u0027widely unreliable and repeatedly dishonest in his evidence\u0027. One thing is for sure, he certainly wasn’t an independent speaker when it came to the EU and as such failed in his role, to be independent!The fact he may additionally have been a bully, doesn’t read well, as to his qualities as a person.\u0027The punishment seems to fit the crime\u0027@S Heslop:Banned from Parliament for life - some very good news indeed. No chance of a peerage, even with the honours for failure approach that is so prevalent at the moment. This must surely quash those rumours that he was hoping to be a candidate for the position of Mayor of London.It\u0027s been a long wait to see this inidual\u0027s deserved public humiliation and for once the punishment seems to fit the crime. Regrettably he still has a large pension, but his future employment prospects must surely be severely restricted. What business or government body would want to be associated with such a person as him?Roman Abramovich sanctioned throwing future of Chelsea into turmoilOn Thursday, the Government announced that Roman Abramovich is among seven Russian oligarchs to be added to the UK sanctions list, putting the sale of Chelsea Football Club on hold, with the club unable to sell tickets for future matches. The majority of  readers agreed that this was the right decision, but highlighted that the Government should have acted sooner.\u0027I agree with a temporary freezing of oligarch assets\u0027@lou cd:I agree with a temporary freezing of oligarch assets until it is proven beyond a doubt that their money has a direct link to Putin, and speed is of the essence in times like this, but hypocritical comments such as ‘we\u0027re choking off the ability for Russia to pay for Putin\u0027s war’ just stagger me.We in the UK have been at the forefront of helping Ukraine fight against the Russians, but that is certainly not the case for many of our Western European counterparts, in particular Germany.If we want to ‘choke off’ the ability of Putin to continue this war, getting Germany and the EU to stop paying over 25 million Euros per day directly to Russia for gas and oil is the way to do it.Targeting people like Roman Abramovich might look good and sound tough, but means nothing if the main money spigot is still flowing.\u0027I can\u0027t agree that Chelsea should be sanctioned in this manner\u0027@Scott Rowan:I can\u0027t agree that Chelsea should be sanctioned in this manner, they are a long standing English club first and foremost.The Government should simply have ensured that Abramovich sold the club, pronto, then added the money to his frozen assets.\u0027A mechanism should be put in place that allows the club to exist\u0027@Christian Grant:Chelsea fan here. At the end of the day, there\u0027s a psycho murdering women and children and threatening nuclear war against us, so I\u0027m not bothered that I can\u0027t attend some games. So I\u0027m with the Government on this. On a medium term scale, i.e. for next season, it would be good if some mechanism could be put in place that allows the club to exist, even if at a lower level (the proper fans will still turn up and we can say goodbye to the day-trippers). I love a bit of rivalry, but I\u0027d never want to see a Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal (in fact any club) put out of existence.Find out what current stories are getting our readers talking by visiting the  Community Hub.Now it\u0027s your turn: what stories from the week got you talking?

Heavily pregnant women, and new mothers clutching babies, were escorted from the blackened ruins of a maternity hospital in Mariupol that had been destroyed by an airstrike, in which three people were killed. They were the sort of unforgettable photographs that can come to define a war. Proof, if it were needed, that Russia is waging war not on the army, but on Ukraine itself.One woman was apparently unmoved, however: Maria Zakharova, director of the information and press department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Putin’s inscrutable spokesman. Asked about the attack in a press briefing, she went on the offensive. “This is information terrorism,” she said, claiming that Ukrainian reports about the airstrike were fake. This followed her earlier claims that Ukraine was developing biological weapons.To the unfamiliar, Zakharova’s sinister tone might seem shocking, but there is nothing new about it. She is merely the most prominent soldier in a clone army of media savvy Russian women who have taken on the job of lying for the Putin regime. They do it in fluent English, with apparent relish, and there are seemingly no depths to which they will not stoop. It may still be men driving the tanks and jumping out of planes. But in the new propaganda war, Putin’s elite shock troops are women. In a country that was used to government press briefings being conducted by dry men in drab suits, these women, with their swashbuckling style and salty jokes, as well as bright lipstick, big hair and sharp outfits, have been a breath of fresh air. Zakharova’s briefings have become must-watch events, amassing millions of views on YouTube.  A mixture of steel and showbiz has turned these women into celebrities. Who cares if they are doing the devil’s work?Yet Putin is far from the only authoritarian world leader to have employed smart women to help with his messaging. Between 2017 and 2020, Donald Trump used his political adviser Kellyanne Conway to similar effect, often via Fox News. It was Conway who defended then-press secretary Sean Spicer’s use of “alternative facts,” and who invented a fictitious atrocity, the Bowling Green Massacre, to defend the president’s immigration ban. For decades before she retired, the North Korean newsreader Ri Chun-hee, sometimes called the “Pink Lady” for her brightly coloured outfits, delivered national news – about nuclear developments or the ongoing success of the leadership – in stern, sometimes melodramatic tones. “I don’t know if Putin and these other leaders are deliberately choosing women, or if it’s simply that they are the best people for the job,” says Jo Tanner, a communications consultant and former adviser to Boris Johnson. “Possibly there’s a macho element in these male leaders choosing female spokeswomen. “I can see the logic of putting up a woman to defend an attack on a maternity hospital. You would be trying to take away the hard edges. But Zakharova is pretty robust in her delivery.” So much so that she, along with Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of broadcaster RT (formerly Russia Today), have been put on the EU sanctions list alongside oligarchs – Zakharova for having “promoted the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine”.Simonyan first came to attention in the UK in 2018 when she conducted the bizarre interview with the Salisbury Novichok poisoners, in which they claimed to be a friendly gay couple who had simply visited the town in order to see the cathedral’s “famous 123m spire”.  When she was asked how she felt about being sanctioned by the EU, she replied sarcastically, “Maria Zakharova and I took out handkerchiefs,” in order to “have a little cry.” Then there is Maria Butina, who was convicted of spying for Russia against the US in 2018, and now serves in the State Duma. On Wednesday, in a Today interview with Nick Robinson that sent marmalade spiralling from spoons all over Britain, she claimed that Ukrainians were shelling themselves. Nor should we forget Anna Chapman, the flame haired former spy, who found time this week to come out in support of the war, in between flogging children’s clothes on Instagram. Senator and government spokesman Valentina Matviyenko, meanwhile, claims that the invasion was the “only way to stop a brotherly war”. Jo Tanner says it’s a moot point whether these women are party to their own lies. “Internally, these spokespeople are playing on the fact that their own people have limited access to other sources of information,” she says. “The whole invasion is based on a complete lie, and is being fuelled by a continuation of that. You would hope that the spokespeople are being duped and they don’t know the truth when they’re delivering it. But you have to question that. They are cultured people doing these jobs. They must be able to see the other sources of information around the world, contradicting what they are saying.” Although Putin’s female mouthpieces have come up via different routes, they have in common conservative views and a history of unswerving loyalty to the chief. Simonyan was a Kremlin reporter, cutting her teeth during the Chechen War before being made editor of Russia Today when she was just 25. “She has a strong journalistic background,” says Emily Ferris, a research fellow at Rusi, a think tank, who specialises in Russia and Eurasia. “She was part of the Kremlin press pack. She proved that she was someone who could be trusted.” Butina was an assistant for Aleksandr Torshin, a Putin ally, who was sent to infiltrate American institutions, including the NRA, in the run-up to the 2016 election. Matviyenko is a longtime Putin loyalist, something which helped her become the first female leader of St Petersburg.Perhaps the most interesting is Zakharova, with the CV that could have taken her anywhere. Her mother was an art historian and her father was Russia’s ambassador to Beijing, where the family lived for 10 years, as a result of which Zakharova speaks fluent Chinese. She has the Russian equivalent of a PhD. “Zakharova is particularly aggressive against the West, which I think some Russians might view as a display of strength” says Ferris. “But Russia is still a pretty misogynistic country, and she also counters a lot of traditional visions of how women should be. I wouldn’t say I admire her, exactly, but it’s very difficult to be a woman in that role.” Sometimes called Putin’s “troll-in-chief”, Zakharova has built a reputation as one of the Russian president’s most combative outriders, unafraid to take the fight to the press. At one notorious briefing in 2018, she confronted a Finnish journalist who had dared to ask about an anti-LGBT campaign being prosecuted in Chechnya by its leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. Stepping out from behind her lectern, Zakharova suggested that the journalist might go and see for himself. “You’re not afraid, are you?” she said. “We’re not joking.” Then she winked. “It was very awkward and uncomfortable,” Erkka Mikkonen told reporters afterwards. “It was like getting called out by the teacher in school. She was trying to make me feel like an idiot.”“She really likes her job she gets a kick out of what she does,” Aleksey Maslov, an economics professor who taught Zakharova in the early Noughties, told Buzzfeed. “She has turned PR management for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs into high theatre.” “Partly these roles have ended up being filled by women because they are less prestigious than the big internal jobs,” says Mark Galeotti, a professor at UCL who specialises in Russia. “But there’s also an awareness that a succession of dull apparatchiks in grey suits didn’t work at punching up the message. Whereas the Zakharovas of the world absolutely get the coverage and the attention. It’s Ann Coulter syndrome.  “Their roles mean that a lot of these women are more famous outside of Russia than at home,” he says. “Butina was a kind of accidental celebrity. Simonyan is a shrewd careerist, with an eye for what will catch people’s attention. It’s hard to know what she believes in her heart of hearts, but at a certain point you make your choices. “Zakharova is probably a different case. She enjoys the combative nature of her job. My sense is that she absolutely believes what she’s saying.” These women are also proof that for a certain kind of ambitious young woman, the Kremlin can offer a path to the top faster than the private sector. “It’s not equal opportunities, exactly,” says Galeotti. “But the Kremlin is interested in tapping whatever human resources it has. Leave your morals at the door, and it helps if you’re attractive.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin says there are \u0026#39certain positive shifts\u0026#39 in talks with UkrainePolitics latest news: Almost 400 Russian politicians banned from UK in new round of sanctionsWatch: Kamala Harris laughs during press conference on Ukrainian refugeesUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as psychiatric hospital bombedPsychiatric hospital hit by Russian forces in eastern UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british army numbers plunge more","story":"British Army numbers plunge by more than , in just three months, figures revealThe Government has abandoned a pledge to maintain the size of the Regular Army at , and will let it dwindle to , - making it the smallest Army for  years.

Shadow Defence Minister Luke Pollard said: “Conservative ministers have cut the British Army to its smallest size in  years, with frontline troops bearing the brunt of these cuts. Our Armed Forces are essential to our national security and resilience. “With growing Russian aggression, the Government is pushing ahead with further cuts to the Army by , troops over the next three years. “Ministers must halt these cuts now. Labour also expects a big boost for defence spending in the Chancellor’s upcoming budget.”It comes as Keir Starmer today told Nato troops in Estonia “the eyes of the world are upon you”. Visiting a Tapa military base with shadow defence secretary John Healey, he thanked soldiers for providing “reassurance” through their presence at the base in the country bordering Russia.He added that “there is no time for party politics” because the world faces “a very grave situation” amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. A small number of serving British personnel are believed to have gone absent without leave to join the fight against the Russian invasion. Boris Johnson warned they would face court martial on theirto the UK, as Ministry of Defence chiefs have banned all service personnel from travelling to Ukraine “until further notice”.Armed forces minister James Heappey said earlier this week: “It is illegal for British service personnel to first of all go absent without leave in the first place, but to go absent without leave in order to fight in a foreign war is simply unacceptable, and frankly risks the United Kingdom being wrongly claimed by Russia to be a belligerent in this. “Service people who might think they are doing the right thing should reflect it is % not the correct thing to be doing.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBritish ArmySoldiersWar crimesCrimePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Days after the party fundraiser, on July , , the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines flight  was shot down by a surface to air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.And just months earlier, Putin had faced international condemnation over the annexation of Crimea.But speaking to LBC Radio’s Andrew Marr today, the former PM insisted Mrs Chernukhin had attempted “absolutely no influence” on UK policies on Russia.Askedhe remembered the game, he said: “I do, I remember - and there was absolutely no conversation about Russia, finance, Putin or anything .”  “We had a very careful system for vetting who could and could not give money to the Conservative Party. “A small handful of people had any connections with Russia, and as I’m concerned most of them were dissidents, often Ukrainians.” Mrs Chernukhin was born in Russia, studied in the United States and became a British citizen in . She is legally eligible to vote and make donations to UK political parties, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part.Ms Chernukhin has repeatedly paid for access to successive Prime Ministers ministers in Party fundraising auctions, including a ‘girl’s night out’ with Theresa May and Liz Truss, dinner with then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and a second tennis match with Boris Johnson, after he became Prime Minister.In total Ms Chernukhin has given almost £ million to the Conservatives - and is the biggest female political donor in British history.Mr Cameron went on: “But crucially, this point - Britain had the strongest anti-Putin policy of any country in Europe. “Who threw him out of the G  Who insisted on the sanctions  Who passed the rules on beneficial ownership  “So I think it’s a giant red herring to suggest in some way that Russian money somehow influenced policy against Putin and Russia.” He added he was the “strongest ally in building a really robust case in holding Putin to account.”  Asked what Mrs Chernukhin and other Russian expat donors were paying for when they gave money to the party, he replied: “Like many people who come and live in this country and make it their home, they get involved in politics because they care about this country, and making sure it’s an open, tolerant and democratic country.” He said there was “absolutely no influence” on the UK’s Russia policies adding: “If they were trying to buy something, they didn’t really get it, did they ” On Tuesday evening, Mrs Chernukhin was given the Award of St Agnes, one of most prestigious honours handed out by the Republic of San Marino at a ceremony in London. The event was attended by a high-level government delegation from the micro-country, including Captains Regent Francesco Mussoni and Giacomo Simoncini, the dual heads of state. Tory MP Andrew Rossindell, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on San Marino, attended the event and gave a speech.

But they do not single out the Prime Ministers behaviourBoris Johnson at a No press conference the day before the lockdown Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsThe government today announced the full list of issues that will be covered by the Covid public inquiry. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry last year after fury at his slow decisions to lock down, which scientists believe cost lives.It will start hearings in the spring and publish any reports in a timely manner, though many fear this will not happen until the next election.Todayaposs draft Terms of Reference do not name Boris Johnson or promise to look at the inidual behaviour of the Prime Minister. That could come as a blow to bereaved families after ex-aide Dominic Cummings accused him of a litany of failings.But they do vow to look at how prepared the government was and how decisions were made, communicated and implemented, including in the disastrous month before lockdown was imposed on  March . While the inquiry will not investigate inidual cases, it will listen to bereaved families and seek to learn lessons for any future pandemic.Scroll down for the full terms of reference - or have your say in the comments. Importantly it will also have reasonable regard to relevant international comparisons, suggesting the levels of death and disease in the UK could be compared to other European nations. And it will look at the response for shielding people, the poorest forced to rely on sick pay of less than £ a week, and those subject to aposdo not resuscitateapos orders. It will examine the response for care homes, where the virus swept through killing tens of thousands of people despite ministers pledging a aposprotective ringapos. But the inquiry will also look at the merits and problems of lockdown itself, not just the virus response that triggered it.Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “The inquiry is a one off and historic opportunity for the terrible suffering and loss of the past two years to be learned from, to ensure these tragedies are not repeated in the future. “The Government finally publishing the draft Terms of Reference is a huge step forward, and we look forward to feeding into the consultation on them. “Sadly, today’s announcement comes far too late. We will never know how many lives could have been saved had the Government had a rapid review phase in Summer , as we called for at the time. “Crucially, Boris Johnson must now commit to implementing the chairaposs recommendations for the Terms Of Reference in full. The fact his office is under police investigation for breaching their own rules means thathe attempts to interfere with what the inquiry looks into, it risks ruining its credibility before it’s even begun.” Boris Johnson suggested the terms of reference will changethere are complaints, as there will be a four-week period to consult on them. He said: It is vital that we get its terms of reference right and that people can have their say. To deliver this, Baroness Hallett will now lead a period of public engagement and consultation, which will last for four weeks. This process will inform further refinements to the terms of reference before they are finalised and the inquiry begins its important work. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the findings must be delivered before the next general election.” Here is the full list of whataposs been announced today by the government, in the governmentaposs own words. In relation to central, devolved and local public health decision-making and its consequences:preparedness and resilience how decisions were made, communicated and implemented intergovernmental decision-making the availability and use of data and evidence legislative and regulatory control shielding and the protection of the clinically vulnerable the use of lockdowns and other ‘non-pharmaceutical’ interventions such as social distancing and the use of face coverings testing and contact tracing, and isolation restrictions on attendance at places of education the closure and reopening of the hospitality, retail, sport and leisure sectors, and cultural institutions housing and homelessness prisons and other places of detention the justice system immigration and asylum travel and borders and the safeguarding of public funds and management of financial risk.The response of the health and care sector across the UK, including:preparedness, initial capacity and the ability to increase capacity, and resilience the management of the pandemic in hospitals, including infection prevention and control, triage, critical care capacity, the discharge of patients, the use of ‘Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’decisions, the approach to palliative care, workforce testing, changes to inspections, and the impact on staff and staffing levels the management of the pandemic in care homes and other care settings, including infection prevention and control, the transfer of residents to or from homes, treatment and care of residents, restrictions on visiting, and changes to inspections the procurement and distribution of key equipment and supplies, including PPE and ventilators the development and delivery of therapeutics and vaccines the consequences of the pandemic on provision for non-COVID related conditions and needs and provision for those experiencing long-COVID.The economic response to the pandemic and its impact, including government interventions by way of:support for businesses and jobs, including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, loans schemes, business rates relief and grants additional funding for relevant public services and benefits and sick pay, and support for vulnerable people.Identy the lessons to be learned from the above, thereby to inform the UK’s preparations for future pandemics. In meeting these aims, the inquiry will:listen to the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss as a result of the pandemic.

He just doesnt know it yetThe only issue is how the rest of the world makes it clear, says Fleet Street FoxVladimir Putin - loseropinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsCast your mind back to the last time you played Monopoly with a sore loser. He - and itaposs always a he - insists on being banker. He declares your family tradition of stashing all the fines in Free Parking to be against the rules. His pile of cash and houses seems to grow every time someone goes to get another bag of crisps, or pops to the loo.Then one player he has driven to the brink of bankruptcy lands on Free Parking, and scoops the jackpot. The balance of the game swings away from the bully. He is found in breach of the rules himself. The others co-ordinate against him, and dad - itaposs always dad - gts his cash and assets to the person most likely to destroy the aggressor. When he buys hotels no-one visits, is jailed and unable to take rent, when the lie that he was All-England Monopoly Champion  is finally disproved, and he has been reduced to being little more than a tiny, pewter boot, he flips the board in a fury.  Weaposve all played with that guy. And picked up the pieces afterwards. We all know there was never any point in helping him to lose more gently so that he could save face. He needed to lose - and for everyone to know it.The wheels have been ripped off Vladimir Putinaposs unserviced trucks. The tanks have been immobile on the roads, and have now gone off-road to become immobile in the mud. Goliathaposs planes and helicopters have been shot down by Davidaposs surface-to-air missiles, and the children Putin sent to war have died in such numbers heaposs been forced to order up mercenaries and Bashar al Assadaposs surviving conscripts. Heaposs shut down the TV stations, lost his Big Macs, and destroyed the mobile phone masts which his own intelligence forces were using to communicate. His generals are dying on the frontline because they had to abandon the control room to get their orders followed. He restructured Russiaaposs economy to be based on energy extraction and supply, and half the worldaposs stopped buying it overnight. The only people choosing to be on his side are the thicker end of the Cha terraces.Nothing in those previous two paragraphs happens when youaposre winning. Andit happens in the space of two weeks, the board-flipping moment when Putin realises his own failure cannot be far off. But whataposs worrying the West is what heaposll do to distract from the loss. Will he mine or gas Ukraine as he retreats  Will he fire tactical, smaller nukes which will obliterate buildings, irradiate the concrete dust sucked into the fireball, and then allow microscopic, inhalable radioactive particles to fall gently along the routes of prevailing winds  Perhaps he will release any one of the deadly pathogens he holds within the worldaposs largest bioweapon stockpile.Thataposs why world leaders, analysts, and journalists talk about an off-ramp, giving the madman an exit where he can make a dignied withdrawal and save face. They want him to think he can keep his job and his billionsonly he de-escalates, and steps back from the brink.The problem with that is a madman in a tank doesnapost give a s*** about the rules of the road. The point at which he was sane enough to spot and take an exit route was waaaaaaaay back, before he lost his mind. If this guy saw an off-ramp now, heaposd bomb it.If Putin is capable of using unimaginably-bad weapons - and he is - then he is adrt from the reality he would need to have any instinct of self-preservation. The flipping of the board is as certain as the coup daposetat the oligarchs he created will stage to save their looted billions. The issue with both is not , but when. Read more If it happens soon, thousands and maybe millions of lives can be saved. The Russian economy can recover, and the world can help Ukraine pick up the pieces. To act against Putin, his deposer needs to be more realistic and practical than he is, which is why it would work in the worldaposs favour and is perhaps also why it hasnapost happened yet among the men he has manipulated and paid off for two decades.Thataposs the end-game the world and its leaders must seek, because Putin is past the point of saving his own face. He would happily saw it off himself, then threaten to do everybody aposs,you let him have so much as a butter kne.The world needs him to lose. To have no exit, and to know it. All despots must see what happensyou invade a sovereign nation, and that the Westaposs immense financial power, whether in the shape of official sanctions or a spontaneous customer boycott, is a weapon with no possible defence.Because he was always going to flip the board one day,you let him play. Giving him an off-ramp means heaposs still mad, and heaposs still got a tank. Letting him slice off a piece of Ukraine is like letting him go bankrupt, but keep a hotel on Mayfair. We should never have sat down with someone who has never obeyed, but only imposed, rules. We are counting the cost of making money while he picked on someone . But the only upside of playing a game with a sore loser is that, when he loses, he feels sorest. Economically throttling his cronies is the swtest, best and only weapon we can use, because they want to keep playing this game. Our best hope is that Putin realises heaposs lost when the board, and all the lives on it, are no longer within his reach.

These elite iniduals have a collective net worth of £ billion, the Foreign Office said in an official announcement. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. Todayaposs decision brings the total number of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by Britain to , with another five already on the list. Sanctions have also been imposed on Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and a number of Belarusian officials  Liz Truss said: Today’s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression.The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame. Boris Johnson said: There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putinaposs vicious assault on Ukraine. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was the right decision but it should not have taken the Government weeks. He said: Too few oligarchs linked to Putinaposs rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK Government. We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the Government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap.Here are the new names added to the sanctions list. Roman Abramovich Roman Abramovich is one of the most high-profile Russian oligarchs in the UK thanks to his ownership of Cha Football Club. Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £. billion and has a multi-million pound property empire in the UK, also has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, the UK Government said. He sold a % stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £. billion in . He recently announced plans to sell the top-flight football club, which he has owned since , after initially saying he was passing stewardship to the clubaposs charitable foundation. Abramovich has denied having strong ties with Putin but the Government said he had had received financial benefits from the Kremlin, including tax breaks for his companies, the buying and selling of shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and contacts in the run up to the  World Cup in Russia.The list shows he has been sanctioned both on the basis of his personal connections to the Kremlin and preferential contracts over the years, but also the role the Evraz steel company plays - the British government believe it is providing steel to the Russian military The football club has now been seized by the UK Government but ministers have issued a licence authorising Cha to continue playing matches. Season ticket holders and those with games already booked can still attend matches, but no new tickets can be sold and the clubaposs merchandise shop will close. Abramovich’s UK property will also be frozen with not even cleaners allowed to enter it. But the asset is still only “frozen” - not actually seized by the UK government. Technically the tycoon’s family - who are not directly targeted with sanctions - could stay in his homes but officials believe it would be practically very dficult. Oleg Deripaska Industrialist Oleg Deripaska, who is Abramovichaposs former business partner, was among those newly added to the sanctions list. The Russian tycoon has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. Deripaska is estimated to be worth £billion, with a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK.  He hit the headlines in  when he hosted Labour grandee Lord Peter Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu. Mr Osborne was accused of trying to solicit a donation for the Tory party from the oligarch - something he denies. The US designated Deripaska in , which is means a personaposs assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them. Igor Sechin Tycoon Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. The UK Government described him as a particularly close and influential ally of Putin and he is understood to be regarded as Putinaposs number two.  He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. The French Government seized a yacht linked to the oligarch last week. Andrey Kostin Andrey Kostin is the chairman of VTB bank, Russiaaposs second largest bank. The bank was designated by the UK last month. The UK put his net worth at an estimated £ million. Kostin was described by the FCDO as a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through the bank.  He has previously accused the West of waging economic war against Russia through sanctions. He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller The chief executive of Russian energy company Gazprom is one of the most important executives supporting the Kremlin. Miller served under Putin in the s when the now-President was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. UK officials believe he has been going along his career trajectory with Putin since the Russian President was was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in s.  Miller has already been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He served alongside Putin in the KGB in Dresden, East Germany, in the s. They have remained closely associated ever since. Tokarev has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Dmitri Lebedev Dmitri Lebedev is the chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya. The UK designated Bank Rossiya, widely considered to be the Kremlin’s private bank, on  February . Lebedev was sanctioned by the US in .

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

She’d been working for supermarket chain Spar and had been given responsibility for its partnership with the charity Marie Curie. “My role was to promote the partnership in Spar stores,” Laura tells The Mirror. And while she worked closely with the charity in her career, she never had any idea how its nurses would end up touching her le.When the first coronavirus lockdown came into effect, Laura decided to move back to Cookstown to look after her parents, who were struggling with poor health.  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Her dad Emmet had been suffering from ongoing heart problems, while her mum Ailish was battling bowel cancer. “I thought, ‘They’re going to need help’. I worried for them. Dad had been poorly for a number of years, and at the time my mum was going through chemo,” she explains. Emmet and Ailish, who had met when they were just  years old, had been married for more than three decades and were an inspiration to Laura. “I grew up with a modest childhood but it was a happy le. It wasn’t filled with big extravagant things,” she says. Laura describes her dad, who worked as a taxi driver, as someone who “lit up a room.” She says: “My dad was very down to earth. He loved le. He had a huge big smile and his laugh was contagious.”  Good with advice, Emmet’s taxi was likened to a confession box because his passengers often confided in him. “He’d never tell us anything though. He knew everything everyone was doing in town but he kept it to himself,” Laura says. But while he never gossiped about others, Laura says her dad often gushed about his daughter to passengers. “I’d come home and people would know all about me - he’d talk about me all the time. I think he was proud of me,” she says. Despite his lust for le, Emmet’s physical health was declining and he’d suffered from heart problems for several years. When Laura moved back to Cookstown she knew he would need help looking after Ailish while she had chemotherapy.  She describes her mum as the “rock who held everything together” in the family. “She loved to travel - I think that’s where I get my adventurous streak from,” Laura says. “She was more like a friend sometimes, I’d have told her anything.” Growing up holding her parents in such high regard, Laura says it was dficult to see them in ailing health - but she cherished the time she spent with them during lockdown. In the summer of  Emmet’s health took a turn for the worse and he ended up in hospital. “He started to really deteriorate and he was in the hospital for nearly three months,” Laura recalls.  “He was in and out of ICU so I told the doctors thatthis was only going in one direction I’d prefer to have him at home. He was such a homely man.” At the end of August, Emmet was brought back to the family home where he was visited by Marie Curie nurses every day. “He was such a proud Irishman, and even in his last days those nurses helped him keep his dignity,” Laura recalls. “To be that vulnerable with your we and daughter in the room is hard, but they supported him with a pain-free ending. They made sure he was really comfortable.” Emmet sadly passed away on  September  at just  years old. Although Laura and Ailish were devastated, they were grateful for the support the nurses had given them during his last days. As Emmet was laid to rest, Ailish and Laura came together with her three brothers to give him as traditional a funeral as they could while social distancing rules were in place.  And while Laura drew strength from a supportive family, the next few months were tough for her and her mum - who was still battling cancer. “We originally found out mum had cancer after she’d visited my oldest brother in Australia,” Laura recalls. “She got pains in her stomach and they thought it was appendicitis, so she had an operation while she was out there. “But when she got home she had a follow-up. She was diagnosed with bowel cancer and it was stage .” Laura says Ailish had a few successful operations to clear ious tumours, but over the years the cancer had continued to spread. By the time Laura had gone home to see her parents during lockdown, Ailish’s care was palliative.  And just months after Emmet’s death, Ailish and Laura received the news they were dreading. Laura recalls: “We sat down with the consultant on Zoom at the end of February and he said the cancer was spreading. My mum asked how long she had and he replied, ‘You’ve got until Easter’. “Mum had just celebrated her th birthday and she looked well. She didn’t look like someone who was dying of cancer. “I said to the consultant, ‘Do you know when Easter is  It’s only six weeks away’. And he said, ‘Yeah, six weeks’.” From that moment on, Laura says she went into “autopilot,” thinking only of her mum.  “Everything I did was for her. She was my priority,” Laura says. As Ailish began to deteriorate, she and Laura began to talk openly about how she wanted her le to end. “We talked about her potentially going into a hospice but we have a huge family, and with Covid restricting visitors, we decided it was best for her to be at home,” Laura says. “She deteriorated slowly, but the Marie Curie nurses helped her too. Mum knew she was dying and the fear and anxiety were very tough for us all.” Laura recalls the nurses arriving at the family home to take care of Ailish and askingthey had the wrong address - because they’d only been there nine months before caring for Emmet. But she doesn’t know how she’d have got through it all without their support.  “They were like walking angels,” she says. Meanwhile, Laura devoted all her time to be with her mum and refused to leave her side. She says: “People had to force me to go to bed. I didn’t want to sleep because I thoughtI slept, that was less time I’d have with mum.” In the last weeks of her le, Ailish laughed and joked with her daughter as they had always done - and even had fun talking about Laura’s love le. “Mum was in bed a lot and we’d be up all hours talking about my future and what my wedding day would be like.“It must have been am and I was on Facebook Dating. We came across a guy called Peter and mum said, ‘Message him, he looks lovely’.”After following her mum’s advice, Laura got chatting to Peter, who was also from Cookstown, and soon after he asked her out on a date.“I was reluctant to go on a date,” Laura recalls. “Mum was my priority and I worried something would happen while I was out.” But friends and family convinced Laura to go, arguing she needed to do something for herself. And after spending a few hours on a walk with Peter, Laura realised she’d made the right decision. The pair realised they’d both lived fairly close by in London for years - and their paths had almost crossed several times before. Although the pair clicked instantly, Laura was keen to get home to see Ailish after a few hours - but she said Peter was understanding from the beginning. “He stuck by me and understood - most guys wouldn’t,” she said. Over the next days and weeks, Peter checked in with Laura every single day - eventhe pair hadn’t seen each other. Sadly, on  June , Ailish passed away at home - and less than a year after losing her dad, Laura had to plan her mum’s funeral too.  Once again, her tight-knit family rallied around to support her while she grieved - and this time, Laura had Peter to lean on too. “He came to the wake and was introduced to everyone - my whole family was there,” Laura says. “When I came back to the house after the funeral and everyone had gone, there was just silence. It’s probably the worst feeling I’ve ever had in my whole le. That’s when the grief takes over. “But Peter was there for me.” After losing both her parents in a short space of time, Laura began to re-evaluate things in her le and made some big decisions. She decided to quit her job and set up her own marketing company, giving herself the freedom to work whenever and wherever she wanted - and fitting in Peter’s work around that. “I live le very dferently now,” Laura says. “I wake up now and it hits me every day like a ton of bricks. But I have a choice: I can stay in bed all day or I can get up and do something positive every day, evenit’s something little.  “Don’t get me wrong, I still have down days, but I think, ‘what would my parents thinkthey were watching me now’ ” As Laura and Peter navigate a new way of living their lives, Laura is keen to encourage people to talk about their grief - admitting that telling people about what her parents were like is incredibly cathartic for her. “Over the last two years during the pandemic, so many more people have lost loved ones,” she says. Laura adds it’s important to acknowledge those we have lost - and she’s taking part in Marie Curie’s National Day of Reflection on  March to honour them. While le is ing to some kind of normal as Covid restrictions are lted, the charity wants to acknowledge those who are still grappling with grief after losing people during the pandemic. It will hold a minute’s silence at midday in tribute to those who died and will also be hosting a Wall of Reflection. For Laura, who holds the charity close to her heart, the day will provide some comfort as she remembers Emmet and Ailish.Do you have a love story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcShe says: “Before I lost my parents I used to thinksomeone lost a loved one you shouldn’t talk about it for fear of upsetting them. “But now,I get an opportunity, I talk about them.

It comes less than  months after the pair lost Malika in October , at the age of . Now, staff at Colchester Zoo are keeping a close eye on lonely Bailey and are even considering relocating him to another zoo with a pride of lionesses.  In a statement issued on their website earlier this week, zoo staff wrote: We would like to thank all our visitors for the overwhelming support that we have received following the devastating news of the passing of our female lioness, Naja, on Friday, March . We have received many kind messages towards our staff, as well as concerns about our male lion, Bailey. Bailey’s health and welfare is our top priority and, whilst our Animal Care Team continues to monitor him daily, discussions have been put in place by the Animal Care Management Team regarding Bailey’s future at Colchester Zoo. The team are currently exploring bringing in a female lioness for Bailey, but this option is reliant on a lioness being available at one of our neighbouring zoos. However, given Bailey’s age, introducing a female at this stage in his le could prove too stressful. The team are also exploring relocating Bailey to another zoo with a pride of lionesses. This would be dependent on another organisation having the space to house Bailey and the move alone could prove too much. Bailey has become a big part of the Colchester Zoo family and parting with him feels almost impossible and irresponsible. Read more Our Animal Care Team will continue to monitor Bailey’s mental and physical welfare over the next few weeks. It’s our responsibility to ensure that Bailey’s welfare is at the forefront of any decision made, which may include letting him live out the rest of his le here at the zoo by himself. A previous statement last week paid tribute to Naja, writing: Naja was truly one of a kind. Her personality and character set her aside from any other animal we’ve had the pleasure to work with. Naja had a gentle side where she would interact with her keepers, but very quickly changed when food was available! Not only will all the staff at Colchester Zoo miss Naja, but she also leaves behind our male lion, Bailey. Bailey and Naja were cousins along with Naja’s sister, Malika, who passed away back in . All three lions had a strong bond, with the bond between Bailey and Naja made even stronger with the loss of Malika.

However, the aggressive cancer ed and at the beginning of this month Gordon was told he likely had just weeks to live,The Daily Recordreports.Gordon, from Dundee, had two dying wishes - to marry partner of -years Audrey, , and host a living wake for himself.  Initially both events were planned for March  but doctors advised the family to move the wedding forward and within  hours they had planned the event at their family home. Step-daughter Kirsty McLean, , said: We got the blood test results on Friday and doctors said the disease was progressing fast and he might not make it to the wedding. Within  hours we had organised a wedding to happen at the house. We were running all over town trying to arrange everything and get cakes. We decorated the house and stuff as well with balloons. It was just close family and friends that attended. Weaposre now planning his living wake at the moment and waiting on another blood test to see how much the cancer has progressed.I had personally never heard of a living wake before and didnapost know it was a thing but he wants to get all his pals together one last time to say goodbye. The living wake is currently planned for March  at Gordonaposs favourite local, Club  in Dundee, but the family expect they will need to bring the event forward again. A band has been booked for the entertainment and a photo booth and photographer have been booked to capture precious memories. Loved ones will also be encouraged to write down their favourite memories with Gordon to share at the special event.  Gordon, who is step-dad to Kirsty, Tami and Dana, and dad to Kerr, is also hoping to have a final outing with his grandchildren. I donapost know how Iaposll manage at the wake, all my sisters and I have done is cry, Kirsty said. We are all just in so much shock - we couldnapost believe it - because he did get the all clear in January. My mum is one of the strongest women Iaposve ever met. Itaposs just her there on her own trying to do everything for him so I think it will really hit her after. Dave Mack from Club said they would make sure Gordon, nicknamed Googs, had a very special evening. Googs is a very well respected member of the Club and dart team,” he said. “Heaposs a good friend of mine as well and has been here for years as a leader of the darts team. For his living wake we will assist his family and make sure we give him something very special. He is such a great guy - he popped in the other week to see everyone and the club was full of people wanting to hi. Weaposre going to pull out all the stops for him to give him a great farewell. The family have scraped together so they could pay for the last minute wedding and are currently paying for the wake with their own cash.

Dubbed ‘Deltacron’, the new French-based strain combines both lineages. However, its severity is not yet known.But there is a warning that immunity is waning in the elderly as one scientist added that it is aposthe real thingapos. The World Health Organisation said it is apostracking and discussingapos the iant following research into the strain. There is no clear data yet to show whether Deltacron is more infectious than its predecessors. Health chiefs told The Sun a very small number of cases have been detected in Britain, but more details are to be reported in a briefing on Friday.Aris Katzourakis, professor of evolution and genomics at the University of Oxford, said: “It is one to keep an eye on. This one is legit. Dr Stephen Grfin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “Whilst it doesn’t seem to have taken off as a dominant strain yet, this could be due to a very slow start based upon seeding density - the number of initial cases, he said.“There are multiple scenarios that can play out here in terms of what this means for people that become infected as this combination of viral proteins may behave dferently to either parent. “The French cluster appears to be a validated occurrence where a recombination event has given rise to a virus fit enough to circulate.Last month, the UK Health Security Agency announced it was investigating a iant named “Delta x Omicron Recombinant ”.However, it is not knownthis is linked to the French-based Deltacron.  Hospitalisation in the UK have shown an aposuptickapos in the past fortnight, data shows. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study estimates around , people are catching Covid each day - a  per cent hike in one week. Study co-founder Professor Tim Spector said: “The ‘official’ UK dashboard rate that continues to provide a misleading picture of the pandemic in the UK and should be scrapped. “The major increase in new cases across the country and in the elderly is a worry, especially as we now see an uptick in hospitalisations for the first time. “This increase was predicted when all restrictions were lted. “We are likely to continue to see high infection and prevalence rates of  in  people for the foreseeable future.” Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UKHSA, said: “The increasing presence of the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see Covid circulating at high levels.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of OxfordCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But after the port worker had been off work for more than four months, his bosses were given a tip-off that he was instructing Hapkido classes. The bosses at PD Ports hired private investigators to carry out aposcovert surveillanceapos on Mr Connorton - and were provided with photos and videos of him teaching the Korean martial art to a class of . The covert recordings showed him driving to class, adopting aposfighting stancesapos, wielding training swords, demonstrating combat moves and carrying heavy objects aposwithout obvious signs of discomfortapos.When the  year old was summoned to explain himself, he claimed he aposcouldnapost rememberaposhe attended any other classes while off injured because his medication gave him aposmemory lossapos. Mr Connorton was sacked for gross misconduct but has tried to sue PD Ports for disability discrimination - however now his case has been thrown out at an employment tribunal. Mr Connorton, who has been training in martial arts since he was , is a th Dan black belt in Hapkido and has won tournaments in the discipline. Alongside others he set up his own class about  years ago and now teaches at Hapkido Teesside in Middlesbrough. The tribunal, held in Newcastle, heard Mr Connorton worked for PD Ports, one of the UKaposs leading port groups operating  dock sites nationwide.  He was a dockyard worker at the companyaposs Teesport site on the River Tees, North Yorks, and worked for the firm since . The tribunal heard Mr Connorton was signed off sick in October  after suffering a aposspasm of painapos at work caused by a degenerative disc bulging from his spine. In February  he told Occupational Health - who visited him at home due to him claiming he was in too much pain to travel - that he was unable to do anything other than read, which he could do while lying on his bed or sofa. On February , Mr Connortonaposs bosses received a report he was aposactually teaching his martial arts classapos. The next day he told Occupational Health his pain had not improved, he could not drive and his symptoms were causing aposlow mood and fatigueapos. However, the same evening he drove to his martial arts class. The private investigators discovered he drove to and attended the Hapkido class on February ,  and  - and they filmed him on each visit. A tribunal report said:The investigators provided PD Ports with a report and photographs and a video recording. Amongst other things, the investigatorsapos report refers to Mr Connorton, without any obvious signs of discomfort or ailment, driving to and from the class. [It shows him] rising from the floor after conducting stretching exercises with a class of approximately  people, assisting with student development, lting a metal barrier and then a five-a-side football goal. [It shows him] carrying a number of training swords and walking approximately  metres carrying a large sports bag holstered over his right shoulder, providing instruction, contributing to martial arts activity instruction including adopting a fighting stance and shouting to all the class that he was about undertake aposmock testsapos for those who wanted to practice. The photographs are supportive of the above in that they show him arriving at the class driving himself in his car, walking without any apparent discomfort, carrying a bag and equipment and moving barriers and a football goal. In the class itself the claimant is shown wearing his Hapkido suit, exercising, conducting exercises, kneeling and demonstrating martial arts moves and techniques. In light of this report, PD Ports was concerned at the apparent disparity between what he was reporting and what he was doing, and that he was not being truthful. During a disciplinary process, Mr Connorton was shown the images but said he could not rememberhe had attended other classes between October  and February  aposdue to drugsapos. Mr Connorton said he was aposnot instructing but was showing and guiding othersapos, which the tribunal ruled was aposlittle more than semanticsapos. He claimed the items he carried were light and he went to the class to improve his mental health but was still in pain. He said he had not done anything aposstrenuousapos. He was sacked in March , with bosses citing apossignicant doubts with regard to your honesty and integrityapos. Employment Judge John Morris ruled the dismissal was fair and had nothing to do with him being disabled as a result of his injury. He said: The reason for [Mr Connortonaposs] dismissal was his lack of candour and frankness throughout the disciplinary process and his failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for his attendance at the Hapkido classes. The key point for [PD Ports] was the aposdisconnectapos between what he had said to Occupational Health on February  and the information from the surveillance team.

Actually called Vincent, the lonely dog is hoping somebody in the UK will come forward to offer in a place in their home. A spokesperson from Blind Dog Rescue UK said: Introducing the gorgeous Vincent who has the unfortunate nickname of Mr Ugly at the shelter.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.He is leishmania positive which caused his blindness and will need regular medication and blood tests for this for his entire le.Since being rescued from the mountains, Vincentaposs fur has completely grown back, meaning he can soon leave his Mr Ugly nickname behind. He has been described as a clam, sweet, and sociable dog who enjoys spending time with humans. New places and situations are stressful for him but he gets used to it quickly, said the spokesperson. In the shelter, he is dominant with other male dogs but he is friendly and playful with female dogs.Vincent would love a patient home where he can learn to trust his new family and can live with a female dog for company. Vincent is currently living in a rescue in Greece but is ready to fly to the UK once a family is found. Blind Dog Rescue UK works to rehome blind and partially sighted dogs who have been subjected to the “worst of humanity yet still have an astonishing capacity to adapt, love and become perfect ambassadors for blind dogs everywhere”. Many of the dogs in their care have been victims of abuse, neglect, disease or trauma - and struggle to survive in shelters. A Blind Dog Rescue UK statement reads: “It is incredibly dficult for sighted dogs to survive anyof time in these shelters let alone blind or partially sighted dogs. “We need to get to these dogs quickly and secure their immediate release and treatment.“These dogs may have been deliberately blinded, involved in road traffic accidents or long term sufferers of painful conditions such as glaucoma.“They need veterinary care and to be given the safety and comfort of a foster home in which to start healing. “Here they are given love and affection and a warm bed - possibly the first they will have experienced in their letimes. At this point, we are able to start assessing and promoting these wonderful dogs for forever homes.To adopt Vincent, or find out more information about him, contact Blind Dog Rescue UK via their website www.bdruk.org.Do you have a story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In it, they opened up about many members of the Firm - with Harry accusing his dad Prince Charles of cutting him off financially and not taking his calls. Even after the explosive chat, he appeared on the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting and talked about total neglect on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See. Later reports claimed that relations between the pair were at rock bottom - but recently there have been signs that Harry, Meghan and Charles could be ready to bury the hatchet. Here we take a look at them... Full of praise  One of the first signs that Harry and Charlesapos relationship could be improving was just a few days into . Charles wrote an essay for Newsweek, where he issued a call for urgent action to save the environment.In the piece, he praised both Prince William and Harry for their work in raising awareness of the issue. He spoke about how he was proud of both of his sons for having recognised the threat of climate change. He said: Most recently, my elder son, William, launched the prestigious Earthshot Prize to incentivise change and help repair our planet over the next ten years by identying and investing in the technologies that can make a dference. And my younger son, Harry, has passionately highlighted the impact of climate change, especially in relation to Africa, and committed his charity to being net-zero.

Shortly after the Newsweek essay was released, the Mirror revealed that Charles had held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with Harry. Sources close to Charles said that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship. One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Regular contact And it seems these video calls might not be a one-off for Harry and Charles and itaposs been suggested they talk regularly.Thataposs because, writing in the , royal expert Camilla Tominey claims that Prince Charles is thought to be in regular contact with his youngest son.However, she added: Whether Meghan will everto the UK remains to be seen. Olive branch invitation Meanwhile, it has also been reported that Charles offered his son an olive branch by offering him an invitation to stay with him the next time he brings his family to the UK.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood. But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. Meghanaposs photo Meanwhile, another sign came on Tuesday when eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a touching photo of Meghan Markle that has pride of place in Charles and the Duchess of Cornwallaposs home.Camilla welcomed three female rowers, who crossed the Atlantic in record time, to Clarence House - the London home she shares with Charles - to mark International Womenaposs Day. They were joined by former male rower Tim Christian and were pictured chatting with Camilla in a sitting room at the royal residence.  Behind where the guests were sitting, royal fans noticed a side table that was filled with lovely family photos. And one of them included a stunning black-and-white image of Meghan with Charles on her wedding day in . When Meghan married Harry, Charles escorted the bride halfway down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - and the framed photo appears to depict this.

Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency , told Sky News: These data confirm that cases have declined substantially following the peak of the Omicron wave.However, the increasing presence of the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see COVID circulating at high levels.

Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said it was “impossible to make a sensible prediction” about the size of any BA. wave but the situation needed close monitoring.He told the: “The worry is that it’s hard to see anything happening in the next few weeks that will reverse the growth of BA. unless, that is, people decide on their own account to step up precautions.”Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, said the recent rise was foreseeable. “We’ll see a great deal more of this, along the lines of recent resurgent spikes in Scotland and Hong Kong,” he said. “Caseloads were by no means low or under control as we came out of all mitigations and, when you add in waning immunity and the enhanced transmissibility of BA., it looks like we are in for a dficult period, especially for the elderly.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDepartment of HealthGrant ShappsHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sanctions have been imposed on a government level while companies have also inidually decided to stop their trade with Russian firms.It is thought that the boycott of Russian goods along with other economic sanctions could force Vladimir Putin into ending the invasion. Many major supermarkets have stopped selling Russian products, with some taking more signicant action than others, reported the Liverpool Echo. Tesco said it will not be removing any products from its shelves, but it will not place any further orders with Russian suppliers.A spokesperson for Tesco reportedly stated that it would no longer be “buying products from businesses that are wholly Russian-owned”. A statement from the supermarket read: “We are supporting humanitarian relief efforts through our partnerships with the Red Cross, food banks and other relief organisations to help those affected in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.” Here are all the products that have been removed from supermarkets: AsdaAsda has confirmed it is removing all products that originate from Russia from its stores and online - around  items in total.Most of these are spirits, though the list also includes fish and some sweets. Asda’s co-owner Mohsin Issa said: “We stand with our customers and colleagues who are shocked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine – and our thoughts are with those people whose lives are affected by this crisis.”On March , Asda and its charity, the Asda Foundation, announced a £m package to support displaced Ukrainian families in Europe and the UK. Aldi The budget-friendly retailer has said it will no longer sell Russian vodka.At the start of the month, Aldi announced that they would be making a donation to the Red Cross Ukraine Crisis Appeal.They said in a statement: We stand together with Aldi colleagues across the world and will be making a donation to the Red Cross Ukraine Crisis Appeal. After initially not confirming the donation amount, the supermarket confirmed they would be donating a further  million euros to established aid organisations to ensure help reaches those that need it most.  SainsburyapossProducts Sainsburyaposs have removed include the Russian Standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds.A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We stand united with the people of Ukraine. We have reviewed our product range and have decided to remove from sale all products that are % sourced from Russia. The supermarket giant has also recently renamed its Chicken Kiev to Kyiv - the Ukrainian capital - to stand with Ukraine. Customers should see the change in packaging over the next few weeks.  Co-op, Morrisons and Waitrose The Co-op, Morrisons and Waitrose have also removed Russian vodka from their shelves. A spokesperson for the Co-op said the decision to remove the sale of Russian-made vodka was a sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine. A spokesman for Morrisons, meanwhile, said: “We have taken action on our vodka lines today including delisting Russian Standard.” Waitrose and John Lewis said earlier this month they would no longer sell products made in Russia, starting with Russian vodka and one line of pizza oven pellets.

Others who stayed at The Airport Hotel in Manchester claim there was a huge stench of cigarette smoke and alleged their bedding had not been changed for three weeks.The budget hotel has faced complaints from multiple guests online, and some have claimed that they found suspicious stains on a duvet and dirt throughout their bedroom, ManchesterEveningNews reports. The accommodation, which is rated two out of five bubbles on TripAdvisor, is owned by Britannia Hotels - which has recently been voted the worst hotel chain in the UK for the ninth year running.In recent weeks, a series of terrible reviews have been shared on the travel site, and guests at the Northenden hotel branch branded it diabolical and filthy. One guest, named Emma, claimed that she had been staying in the hotel after fleeing domestic abuse. Rating the hotel just one star, she wrote: Cleaning staff haven’t changed my bedding in THREE WEEKS actually think I’m going to be sick from how they’ve treated me. Another, named Laura alleged she had an awful experience where she found herself sinking right through the mattress through to the other side. Laura claimed that after she changed rooms three times she ended up in one with stained bedding. She said: Given room  and wanted a little sleep. Pulled back the duvet and the bed springs were coming through the mattress so we were given another room on the same floor. I sat on the bed and sunk through it! It jolted my back really badly. I took a picture of the mattress to show the manager.  Was given a third room and the manager came with us and again a mattress with the springs sowingthrough. He admitted that all the mattresses in the hotel were in the same sorry state. So I asked for spare duvets to sleep on to try to create padding from springs. One of the spare duvets had blood on it! I then got the spare pillows down and they had hairs all over them from a previous guest. Also there were chocolate buttons under my bed and a chupa cup wrapper under my friendaposs bed. Certainly not cleaned. Putting hygiene sticker on the door make no dferenceyou do not vacuum the floor! She also claims that she woke up in the morning with terrible back pain and was forced to lie on the dirty floor to try and relieve it. Another guest, Catherine B, said it was the worst hotel she has ever stayed in. She said: Our allocated room was an unprepared room that had not been cleaned, it had dirty sheets on the bed that had clearly been slept in and mud on the carpet. This was rectied, but our subsequent room was dreadful. The mattress had springs you could feel through the sheets, and the edge of the mattress had collapsed. The whole hotel is worn out and everything needs replacing. The lts smell of stale cigarette smoke. The whole place has an unpleasant odour, possibly due to the smoking rooms, and cigarette smoke infiltrating the whole building. Avoid at all costs. Another user, Aidan, included pictures of a stained door handle and a stain on the floor, saying: Honestly, DO NOT STAY HERE! Rooms are filthy, unfit for purpose and theyaposre just an absolute joke all around. The lts look like they haven’t been replaced since the s.

Despite this, not everyone has had a bad experience at the Airport Hotel, with one recent guest saying it was absolutely fine. One read: Our room was fine. Clean, warm and quite spacious actually but the bed was a bit old and uncomfortable. Other than that itaposs dficult for us to really find fault. We had a burger and chips from the bar which was perfectly edible and we only stayed in the room for just over  hours. Itaposs not The Ritz and the room decor was a bit tired but for our purposes, the Britannia was absolutely fine. Another recent review added: Perfect for our needs for an early flight from Manchester airport! The room is cleana little basic but plenty space for our family! The reception staff are very friendly and efficient and the bar very welcoming! Suited our needs perfectly! Great value for airport parking too! Thecontacted Britannia Hotels for comment.

Kate had her sister Pippa as her maid of honour while Prince William chose his younger brother Prince Harry as his best man.Harry kept up best man tradition by giving a speech at the wedding reception - and according to many of the guests it was the highlight of the big day, evenhe did make Kate cry. Royal author Katie Nicholl gave an insight into the tear-jerking speech in her biography Harry: Le, Loss, and Love.  She said: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. The speech was peppered with Harryaposs classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: aposWilliam didnapost have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kateapos. Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate aposBabykinsapos, to much laughter from the guests.

When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. Kate and brother-in-law Harry previously had a jovial relationship - he even famously described Kate as the sister he never had and the pair were often seen giggling or sharing a joke at royal events.But according to royal expert Duncan Larcombe, Harry and Kateaposs sibling-like relationship is now long in the past.  It comes amid a growing feud between William and Harry and the fact that Harry and we Meghan Markle decided to quit as royals and leave the UK for Calornia. And speaking earlier this year as Kate approached her th birthday, Duncan told OK! : Kate was, as Harry said, the sister he never had and clearly that is not the case anymore.There was a time when Harry would have been instrumental in any celebrations or any fun that the couple were having, but those days are long in the past.

Sheaposs great as she is.” The tweet sparked discussion among royal fans, who were quick to also share their thoughts.One person said: I donapost even think she is trying to be Diana, I donapost see any major similarities to Diana apart from the fact that they are both beautul and kind.

The Duchess of Cambridge has made her own mark and done things her own way including creating her adorable family. A third commented: Of course she canapost be compared to Diana. Diana was doing over  appearances every year, and so many tours and she was so young. She had a huge influence on pop culture and her Charity work remains unmatched. So yeah. No comparison.

She quickly settled on being a delivery driver, which she could fit around her current hours at the airport and soon realised how lucrative her second job could be.The mum-of-one, from Worthing, West Sussex, did so well that she eventually decided to quit her day job after two years. She can now rake in up to a grand a week by putting in -hour days and is able to plan her schedule around her two-year-old daughter.  And the profit she has made from the delivery job is enough to fund a nice lestyle, including a recent trip to Disney World in Florida. Atlanta said: Iaposm really happy I made the decision to do this job full time. With delivering, I can choose my own hours, work as much as I wish too and earn the same money or more. It was a risk as delivering is self employed and the money is not guaranteed, but I have no regrets and it is working really well.  Atlanta worked at Gatwick prior to giving birth and realised that she could make extra money by delivering while on maternity leave. She said: I worked there for three and a half years but I have a daughter who is coming up to three years old. The hours I had to work and the sht pattern was not flexible enough at the airport. I started delivering whilst on my maternity leave as an extra form of income. Thanks to the flexibility of delivering, I found I could work the hours I wanted to around my daughter. I started posting videos of me delivering on my social media which did really well so I decided to leave my full time job so I could pursue delivering and growing my social media channels.  Since ditching the airport job, Atlanta has been putting in the hours working on her own time delivering in the car for Just Eat, Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Beelivery. She starts as early as am and works until as late as :pm - racking up around  deliveries on a busy day. Her hard work has been worth it as sheaposs been raking in the cash, making up to £, a week through delivering across the south east of England. Between February  and February  alone, she earned £. from Just Eat, £. from UberEats, £. from Deliveroo and £. from Beelivery, as well as £ in cash tips - totalling at an impressive £. in just one week.  Atlanta was amazed by the amount of money sheaposs been making alongside her boyfriend, Benjamin Hasker, , who also works as a delivery driver as well as a magician and doing Punch and Judy shows. The mum has no plans toto the airline industry and is thrilled with her new career. She said: Itaposs not guaranteed to be £, every week - the more hours you put in, the more you earn. Thanks to my hard work earning this amount of money, myself, my daughter and my partner all went to Disney World, Florida, for two weeks in December  . This was my daughteraposs first ever holiday. I have already bought two cars outright in the time that I have been delivering for work. I havenapost bought anything for my daughteraposs third birthday yet as it is in June, but we are planning to go to London for the weekend for a trip to London Zoo. Iaposm really happy I chose to pursue this as a full time career. It was a risk but I have no regrets.

A bust of a woman stands tall at the back of the room, while gold trimmed patterned chairs and couches are positioned next to the light blue walls.

Breaking the Roman theme, there is a flat screen TV hung from the wall and a guitar amplier resting on one of the chairs.

While there can only be one Best in Show, countless dogs have been impressing spectators with their silky coats, charming temperaments and outstanding obedience. Made to look their best, many dogs have been treated to a trip to the groomers before their arrival at the worldaposs largest dog show, with some even showing up in dog-friendly clothing and accessories. To celebrate all things Crufts, we are sharing the show-stopping dog with the best trims who are sure to turn heads at this yearaposs competition.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Spotted on the grooming table at the National Exhibition Centre, an old English sheepdog has been making spectators smile with their adorable cheeky buns and top knot. A brown Hungarian Puli, which has one of the most striving coats in the show ring, was seen snuggling with its owner as she made him show ready. According to The Kennel Club, the breed owes its origins to Hungarian herding dogs of the Far East, which accompanied the Magyars as they travelled west.  A statement reads: One of the Hungarian corded breeds, the puppy coat of loose flocks later cords naturally and provides insulation and protection. Underneath the coat the dog is lightly built and his nimble movement and agility made him fit for . Elsewhere, an adorable poodle was spotted on the grooming table before judges arrived to rate its spectacular coat, and a cheeky Afghan hound was seen having its hair brushed to look its best before its competition category.  When the competition ends on Sunday, Crufts will have been broadcasting for a record-breaking  hours across the UK on Channel and More. The celebrations officially kicked off at the launch on March , with Paralympics presenter, Sophie Morgan, announced as the new face of Crufts. Sophie said: Iaposm so happy Crufts is back!

Almost all breeds will be represented at this yearaposs four-day event - including the smooth-faced Pyrenean Sheepdog who will be competing for the Best in Show title at Crufts for the first time ever. A Crufts statement reads: Organised by The Kennel Club, the show celebrates every aspect of the role that dogs play in our lives. Crufts has changed in ways that couldn’t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in Victorian times by the late Charles Cruft.  Although it was a very dferent event in , Charles Cruft was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today, which has become an essential date in any dog lover’s calendar. The dog show is still an important part of the event, celebrating the unique relationship that dogs share with their owners.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Using side-by-side pics, Hayley - who goes by the username @ hayleymadiganfitness - showed the dference between an Insta Pool Pose Vs What I see in the bathroom mirror, showing a posed pic next to what her bum looks like in reality.In a powerful caption, Hayley explained: Dferent poses, dferent camera angles, dferent posture, dferent lighting can all make a huge dference to how a body is perceived and more specically how you see your own body! You will see your body in all types of angles and poses. You will see your body relaxed and unposed. You will see yourself in many ways so do not let your eyes deceive you by telling you to feel negative towards your own body.  She continued: You have the power to change your mindset, to look at your own body in a kinder manner. To be kinder to yourself and to your mental health. To be kinder to your body, because it is your home and you only have one so treat it with the best kindness you can offer! We often pick holes in our bodies continuously but when you realise that no one worth having in your le wouldn’t ever pick those same holes about you is an important thing to remember. The people that care and love you do not see you the same way, all they see is the happiness, the love, and the sparkle that you bring to them and the world. You’re not just a body, you are YOU, so be kinder to yourself. Many people have been greatly touched by Hayleyaposs wise words, which are so very important in an age where le filtered through a social media lens can seriously impact the way we view our bodies.One person thanked Hayley for bringing some honesty to Instagram, really admire you for this, while another described her honesty as inspiring.A third person remarked that they wished such pics were shown in high schools, adding: I speak for myself around that age, I only saw the ‘perfect’ Instagram bodies. It’s easy to lose track of what is picture-perfect and what is real. I’d rather see everyday-perfect than picture-perfect more.

Going through labour and giving birth is just about the most painful experience a woman can go through - and many women are left traumatised afterwards. And when it comes to taking the baby home, a new mumaposs mind will be all over the place, worrying about car seats, sleeping and night feeds. So for most mums, the idea of putting on a full face of make-up just after giving birth would barely enter their headspace. But one new mum on TikTok begs to dfer. The mother, who goes by the name Zee Zee, filmed herself getting ready to leave the hospital after giving birth via C-section - but not before she put her war paint on. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The mum, who posts under the handle @mamazeezee, filmed herself drawing on her eyebrows, putting on primer, applying foundation, and then contouring her face. She also applies eyeshadow, blusher and highlighter before completing her look with mascara. In another shot, the new mum chows down a delicious-looking taco, with the caption: Break time, Iaposm hungry. After replenishing her energy supply, Zee Zee then pulls out her lashes and glue and applies those too. Finally, she applies lip liner and lipstick before putting a setting spray on her face.  In the final shot, Zee Zee turns the camera to face her boyfriend, who has been watching her apply her make-up while he holds the baby, with a baffled look on his face. She writes: My boyfriend judging me. In another video, Zee Zee, who has a knack for make-up, films herself applying a full face once again when she gets home - and she even curls her locks to complete the look. People impressed with her skills commented on her videos to tell Zee Zee they would have done exactly the same thing. One woman wrote: I hope I have this same energy after this baby in July. Another said: So happy seeing women take such good care of themselves after having a baby get it girl! But most people were baffled at how Zee Zee could have managed to put on a full face of make up so soon after a C-section.

But it seems one man on Reddit didnapost get the memo, as he admitted he only recently found out about the special prize-winning eggs - just hours after polishing off a half white, half milk chocolate Creme Egg.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The student, who posted his story anonymously, confessed he had no idea that the egg was special until he saw an advert for the promotion just a few hours later when he had already eaten the chocolate treat and thrown the foil wrapper in a public bin.He said: I am an international student studying in the UK, and so I don’t really keep up with the ads here. A few months ago, Cadbury released  prize-winning eggs across the country with the chance of winning a range of cash prizes including £, .Long story short, I was scrolling through Instagram today and saw the prize-winning egg that looked identical to the one I ate a couple of hours ago. It then dawned on me. I potentially ate £,. The manaposs blunder has left him facing utter defeat as he comes to terms with the potential jackpot he missed out on, as he added: I don’t actually know what  to say other than utter defeat. I think I have officially hit the lowest point in the short  years of my le. While finding one of the rare Creme Eggs is a dficult task in itself, the chances of actually bagging £, are very slim - as only six of the  winning eggs are actually worth the top prize. The six eggs were hidden in an Asda, Co-op, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and an independent retailer, while a further three eggs worth £, on sale in a Waitrose, One Stop and a Booker shop.  Four eggs worth £, are being sold across Iceland and Booths stores, and there are  eggs with prizes of £, while the rest are scattered throughout participating retailers and are worth £ each. Commenters on the Reddit post were sympathetic to the manaposs plight, but many of them suggested he may be able to salvage his prizehe kept hold of his wrapper. One person claimed: To claim, you simply call a number that’s printed on the tin foil wrapping of the winning egg. While another added: Thataposs irrelevant. Evenyou ate the egg, the code you need is on the wrapper, you donapost need the egg itself. So you enjoyed the chocolate, get the packaging out of the bin and collect your winnings! Unfortunately for the student, he had been eating his egg while out and about - so threw the foil wrapper into a public bin and was unable to retrieve it. However, terms and conditions for the Cadbury Creme Egg hunt state that a picture of you not eating your winning egg may be required via email to prove that youaposre the rightful owner of the winning egg. Prizes must be claimed by June ,  and you’ll have to call a number that is printed on the tin foil wrapping of your winning egg to register your win. Andyou really canapost resist the urge to scoff your winning egg, Cadbury has teamed up with sustainable fashion brand Rua Carlota to create a line of clothing that makes it impossible to actually eat the chocolate treats.

One concerned viewer said: I found this property on Rightmove. And itaposs covered in police crime scene tape. Did the seller estate agent not think about removing it first  However, on closer inspection, it seems all is not as it initially appears as the tape is emblazoned with aposDo not useapos, whereas crime scene tape often features cordons splashed with aposPoliceapos or aposPolice line do not crossapos. There is no suggestion the pad in Preston, Lancs, was actually a crime scene. On the contrary, Taylors Estates claims the address is quite the steal as it has two bathrooms and boasts views of the River Ribble.  The estate agent adds: With parking available at the front of the property on the road, the house offers a small front courtyard style garden which leads to the front door and into an entrance vestibule. Continuing into the property and into the main hall you are met with the main open staircase on the left-hand side of the building and your first reception room on the right which boasts a great bay window to allow a flood of light. In the middle of the house sits the second reception room with a good-sized kitchen dinner to the rear of the house and utility sitting at the back. The back garden again is a small but cosy sized courtyard. The first floor houses the three double bedrooms with the master at the front of the house which is accompanied by an ensuite with toilet and walk-in shower.

A young woman has shared how she was left disturbed during a flight after the man seated next to her began acting inappropriately, making her feel so uncomfortable that she claims she cried for ten minutes.During a recent flight, where there were only two seats per row on the plane, a model and actress named Melanie found herself sat in the window seat, with an old guy - who she didnapost know - beside her in the aisle seat.According to Melanie, the man proceeded to use both armrests, leaving her without an armrest and squished up against the window. But this wasnapost the worst part. Already feeling annoyed by the situation, Melanie says she looked over at the man, only to see that he was typing the words sex on a plane into his phone, before proceeding to watch videos of people doing it on a plane.

At this point, Melanie says she was already crying and freaking out, explaining to her followers that she has been sexually assaulted in the past, a factor that only added to her panic about the situation. After Melanie told the flight attendants what was going on, they kindly went back to get her stuff from her seat for her, as she was too scared toto the row where the man was sitting. They get my stuff from my seat and they move me to first class, and for the whole flight I was crying and trying to calm down and move on, she explains. Itaposs okay, Iaposm very grateful that the flight attendants helped me, Iaposm glad that I was able to remove myself from the situation. Who knows what would have happenedIaposd have stayed there   In a TikTok clip that has since gone viral, Melanie - who goes by the username @ aiengir - can be seen sitting safely in first-class, sticking her tongue out cheekily at her followers as she lets them know what had unfolded.Many people have praised Melanie for coming forward about what had happened to her, with one follower writing: The fact that you said something is so commendable because a situation like that you can feel so frozen and scared.

While theyaposre able to provide you with unconditional love and companionship, they cannot clean up after themselves and rely on you to collect their aposofferingsapos dotted around the garden.But one owner got more than she bargained for when it comes to poo picking-up duties, as she ended up mushing her dogaposs waste for three and a half days straight in search for her missing wedding ring.Owner Shyler Brianne Kraus, who works from home, was in the midst of an important Zoom call when her dog, Finn, was playing with his toys in another room. She said: Usually my working from home consists of him still getting whatever attention he wants but since this was such an important meeting, I wasn’t doting on him like I normally would.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Halfway through the meeting I could hear him playing with something metallic because I could hear the little ting sounds from his teeth and nails. I’m not sure how I knew but in the moment I just knew it was my wedding ring. He did what any rational-thinking puppy would do -eat the most valuable item in my possession in order to teach me a lesson. I left my wedding ring on my bedside table, a mistake I no longer make, and he was able to hop up onto my bed and snatch it. Kind of a aposI’ll show her! She can’t work when I want to playapos. Seconds after Shyleraposs meeting ended, Finn wandered into the room and sat behind her impatiently waiting for her to start playing with him. After an unsuccessful search for her wedding ring, she ended up rushing Finn to the vets to get an X-ray. Despite being fed a bunch of high-fibre food at the vets, Finn did not make any aposofferingsapos, and Shyler was told to go home and examine his poo until her rings shows up. Thursday night: no ring. Friday morning: no ring. Friday midday: no ring, said Shyler, from Decatur, Illinoi. We brought him back to the vets office for another X-ray to be safe and to schedule a aposjust in caseapos X-ray for Mondayhe hadn’t produced it over the weekend. All weekend long, I mushed poo pile after poo pile. I’ve never been so grateful to have a mask to wear and still my dog’s stomach remained my grossest jewellery box. On Monday, a very stressful day for us, we discovered that after three and a half days my ring had started to make the journey to Finn’s forbidden zone. Thanks to my mother-in-law’s incredible cooking, my father-in-law always throwing Finn an extra treat or two, and my husband’s frantic games of fetch and ball catch, we got the ring back! Dramatic Finn was unknowingly just  minutes away from being taken back to the vets to undergo a surgery to remove the ring.Shyler added: Special thanks to the team at Northgate Pet Clinic- Decatur, IL who went above and beyond for my little furry terror and helped me see the humour in the situation with these X-ray pictures.He’s actually quite the legend at the vet’s office now too!

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

The -year-old, who lives out in Otago on New Zealandaposs South Island, lives an extraordinary le which involves performing dentistry on himself and not collecting any benefit to survive. There was no particular animosity or argument in the family that broke them apart - but the separation came after the death of Little Johnaposs brother which hit everyone very hard. Little John was battling addictions and watched the collapse of his relationship - and thataposs when he moved out to live in the cave. And he hasnapost moved for the last  years. After publication Stuff shared Little Johnaposs story, his family, including his sister based in Australia, got in touch saying they were so grateful for the words about him.Little Johnaposs sister said: It feels like a weight has been lted, no longer fearing the worst and wondering where he was. It also caused his father, who Stuff agreed not to name and who is based in Dunedin, New Zealand, to contact a foodbank to try to track him down. Michelle Kerr, from the Mosgiel Community Foodbank, told  News it was a huge step for him. Little John explained that he knew his fatheraposs address but hadnapost visited him since he moved to the South.  But on Wednesdaythe father and son were finally reunited after  years apart. Little Johnaposs dad said it was a wonderful experience. The pair enjoyed a meal and spent quality time together - Little John even spoke to his sister in Australia. Little John even found out his mother had died in . The father and son decided they plan to see each other again in the future.  Living several kilometers away from the closest human structure, Little John said itaposs there that he found peace with God and became close with his fellow Christians.Little John himself said the Stuff article had helped him too as he has been able to form bonds with local residents. Where previously they were wary of picking him up, he can now hitchhike. And a few weeks ago Little John said he heard people calling his name who had obviously gone looking for him. Struggling to find his cave at first, they began calling his name, to which he replied Gaposday. Little John said he had had some offers from hopeful aposcave womenapos, but not as many as he wanted. He particularly likes the cold months in the Otago caves and plans to spend winter there. Explaining why he lives in the cave he said for me itaposs natural, and natural is healthy.  He also doesnapost want to claim the unemployment benefit or eventually the pension because he said the money would give him access to his addictions. Little John explained heaposs always had a problem with booze and smokes but now he smokes and drinks much less basically because he canapost afford it. He has given up on Government support, come off the dole and closed his bank account in what he describes as a really big step. Doing odd jobs and using food banks, he gets by on around  a year. Little John added that he lives in a cave because itaposs free but also because nobody bugs him there.

But with state media having backed the Ukrainian invasion the majority of Russians appear to seemingly be in support of the invasion - and it is Putinaposs control over journalists that has helped him to rule without any signicant opposition. Now, though, on a programme hosted by Vladimir Soloviyev, a staunch supporter of Putin’s regime, guests openly criticised the attack on Ukraine with one saying it was like “Afghanistan but even worse.” The use of Afghanistan as an example is signicant in Russia as it is seen as a military humiliation - with the country having spent  years in the country before withdrawing in . Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Soloviyev has been pedalling state propaganda even agreeing that the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol this week was “fake news” - claiming the building was now being used by Ukraine troops.He was left fuming, though, by comments on his Thursday night show where they questioned what the Russians were doing in Ukraine.Karen Shakhbnazarov, a filmmaker and political commentator, took a dig at the decision to invade Ukraine on the Russia  channel. “The war in Ukraine paints a frightening picture, it has a very oppressive influence on our society. Ukraine, whichever way you see it, is somewhere with which Russia has thousands of human links, he said, reported the Daily Beast.  The suffering of one group of innocents does not compensate for the suffering of other innocent people... I don’t see the probability of denazication of such an enormous country. We would need to bring in . million soldiers to control all of it. He added: The most important thing in this scenario is to stop our military action. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Shakhbnazarov did toe the country’s line that the war was caused by the United States but he said that a “humanitarian disaster” would also see Russia’s allies like China and India distancing themselves.  The host, who is one the Russians to have been sanctioned by the EU and has had an Italian villa seized, was left annoyed by the analysis but other guests were also critical. Semyon Bagdasarov, a Russian Middle East expert, agreed with Shakhbnazarov and said that Russians need to prepare for total isolation. He drew the parallels with Afghanistan saying: Let Ukrainians do this denazication on their own. We can’t do it for them... As for their neutrality, yes, we should squeeze it out of them, and that’s it.  We don’t need to stay there longer than necessary... Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse  There are more people and they’re more advanced in their handling of weapons. We don’t need that. Enough already... As for the sanctions, the world has never seen such massive sanctions.” Other media shows have also given an insight into the war casualties in Ukraine with Russian soldiers dying, which is also going against the official line that the battle is going according to plan.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

As the electric blade slowly descends on her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly fly open leaving us in suspense over her fate. In this jaw-dropping moment, Arnott and new recruit Georgia Trotman run to see the witness of the convoy ambush after Flemming spotted Denton making a call to the hospital where they were being treated. Arnott and Trotman see the witness being treated by a suspicious-looking nurse as they rush to the scene. Seeing through the wig and scrubs disguise, Arnott fights the assailant, later revealed to be bent copper Jeremy Cole, but is knocked out with a bed pan, leaving Trotman to fight alone. She is fatally overpowered by Cole and gives one last look of anguish before being thrown out the window to her death.

His place in the team to play Italy tomorrow has gone to Glasgow back Kyle Steyn.The announcement of the suspension came from the RFU, England’s governing body, but Townsend believes the issue needs to be claried at global level. He cited a try in which South Africa winger Makazole Mapimpi handed off two Japanese players as an example of what is and should be allowed, and contrasted that with the ruling that has deprived him of Van der Merwe. “I was really disappointed with the decision at the time, and I’ve been scratching my head ever since,” the Scotland coach said. “We’re allowed to hand off in the game of rugby. It’s in the law book and something we do from a young age. It’s something which is celebrated.“So you’re allowed to put your hand in someone’s face, in the head area. So for someone to attempt that at high speed against another player who is going at high speed, who is upright trying to tackle him, and execute it in the end but on the way to doing that his forearm touches that player’s face ...  “The fine margin for that, from something which would have been celebrated as a great hand-off, to be sent off from the game and you are not going to play for three weeks, is ridiculous in my view. And World Rugby need to come out with a statement and make a distinction between something which is legal and encouraged in the game, and not put attempted hand-offs in the same criteria as a high tackle or a dangerous ruck clear.“They [the English ] followed the head-contact process, but I think that is wrong in this situation,” he added. “We should be protecting the attacking player in a circumstance like that when he is up against someone trying to tackle him upright.“So, obviously we’re disappointed for Duhan. He’s very upset. But we’ll move on, and Kyle will go and grab his opportunity. But I have real questions about the game and what we’re trying to do here, when a hand-off to the face is allowed and encouraged.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snps-independence-project","story":"The SNP’s current excuse not to inflict a second, unnecessary, isive referendum on Scotland follows similar postponements because of Brexit and Covid. If a project has to be cancelled three times because it would be unwise, foolish and dangerous to proceed then it is reasonable to conclude the project is fundamentally flawed.If Scotland, truly was oppressed by being part of the United Kingdom and there was a genuine appetite by the majority to separate Scotland from family and friends in the rest of the United Kingdom then the SNP would proceed regardless of other factors.It is over for the SNP separation project. The United Kingdom will stay united.Bruce Halliday, Dumfries.NO RIGHT TIME FOR INDYREFRUTH Marris right to say that now is not the time to go for a second independence referendum. I would go further and say that there is no right time in the foreseeable future. The Ukraine crisis, along with pandemic recovery, climate change, Brexit fallout, NHS waiting lists, rampant inflation, ageing population, housing shortages and falling education standards are just some of the myriad problems governments and elected representatives will have to deal with at international, national and local level over the coming years and decades. They will all lead to more demand on council services and fewer financial resources to deal with them. Local council elections may seem trivial in comparison, but whatever your political views we should vote for candidates who are motivated by something other than separatist ideology. Use all your single transferable vote choices to elect people who will concentrate on solutions and not those who would add further distraction, complexity and uncertainty to an already dficult situation.Ms Marr quotes Martin Niemoller’s famous reasoning that bad things happen because “I did not speak out”. The council elections are our next chance to get our voices heard. Mark Openshaw, Aberdeen.FM SHOULD STAY OUT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRSYET again, Scotland’s First Minister simply cannot resist offering her opinion and even advice to Nato over the Ukraine crisis. She completely ignores the fact that she and her Government have no role to play in foreign affairs as this is not a devolved area of responsibility, but no matter, in she es again. Quite why those involved in the decision-making process within Nato would take a blind bit of notice of her “advice” is anyone’s guess, particularly when her “advice” is seriously misguided and potentially disastrous. Does she not believe that Nato would already have introduced a no-fly zone over Ukrainethis was practical  Does she not understand the implications of Nato forces shooting down Russian jets  All this from a First Minister and a party that not long ago wanted to leave Nato, still wants to remove nuclear weapons from Scotland and in effect be defenceless against any Russian aggression but of course then remain a beneficiary under the nuclear defence umbrella provided by Nato. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon might want to concentrate on everything in Scotland that is and has been broken under her watch.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.RUSSIA COULD GO NUCLEARTHE United States has intimated that Poland’s cunning attempt at mission creep around what is in effect a redeployment of its Mig-s to the USAF base at Ramstein in Germany has been, quite rightly, vetoed by the US.It ill behoves the First Minster to add her own to the voices suggesting that the option of a no-fly zone be kept on the table. A no-fly zone is precisely the sort of mission creep that could lead to a limited nuclear exchange. In case those who advise Ms Sturgeon on matters military have not pointed this out, tactical nukes in the Russian arsenal do exist. And as insane as it sounds, “escalate to de-escalate” is part of Russian doctrine.Bill Ramsay, Convener SNP CND, Glasgow.  "},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-subway-inner-outer-circles-stopped","story":"Initially, the Outer circle service was reported to have been suspended at around : am due to a power failure.As of around : am it was confirmed that both the Inner and Outer circle services have now been suspended as workers race to resolve the issue.Apologies all, both Inner and Outer Circles suspended due to power failure.

This tricky operation was months in the planning to ensure every little detail had been thought of and that we got it right.“As a result of everyone’s hard work and the meticulous planning and safeguarding that went into this operation, we’re absolutely delighted that the nine vehicles have been successfully recovered.“Our attention now turns to getting things in the park back to normal for everyone. We’re refilling the reservoir to its original level, in a controlled manner, and we’re continuing to test water quality to ensure there are no issues.“Mother Nature will take its course and the people of Paisley can once again enjoy this space in a safe manner.”In the run-up to removal day, the water level of the reservoir was gradually lowered daily to bring it to a workable level that would help mitigate for any possible environmental impact. Rigorous testing and monitoring of the water was carried out on a regular basis.Additional mitigation measures were put in place to help avoid any impact on the local water environment. A fish rescue was carried out by Ayrshire Rivers Trust and booms were positioned to help soak up any potential contaminants.Once the reservoir was at a safe level, ers entered the boggy basin to pre-sling the cars in preparation for them being winched from the mud and silt by a recovery truck.From beginning to end, it took just one day for the nine vehicles to be towed out. They were washed down, inspected by local police and then transported off site – headed for the scrapyard.The makes and models of the cars uncovered were a Rover a Citroen AXa Ford Mondeoa Citroen XMa Nissan Prairiea Vauxhall Astraa Peugeot a Vauxhall Carltonand Fiat Uno .A spokesman for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency said: \"Collaborative work between agencies is positive and essential to ensure the environment is considered at every stage.\"Because of the complexity of the removal process, detailed discussions were held between SEPA and Scottish Water.“We are pleased the works passed without incident and steps have been taken to positively improve the local environment.”Marie McGurk, convener of Renfrewshire Councils communities, housing and planning policy board, said: \"Im delighted to see the work to remove these cars from the Lower Glen Dam Reservoir is complete as we want to protect and improve our environment wherever possible and I know the local community were keen to see the situation resolved.\"We will now work with Scottish Water to identy any additional measures required to stop this happening again, with a new gate already in place within the park.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"March ,  at : pm#If it ain#t broke, don#t fix it.# So said Councillor Barbara Foulkes in her support of the successful resistance to the latest attempt to impose mid-term elections for Orkney#s local government leader.

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces.

Im not afraid of it and I will do everything I can to help these guys\" pic HoZSCwYlM— Leeds UnitedMarch , Marsch said: “We just started trying a bunch of things that we never talked about and we have to stay to the plan. We have to stay to the plan.“If we don’t do that then we’re weaker. We see the weaknesses of our players and not the strengths. So that will certainly be a message.”There were signs that Marsch had made an immediate impact in his bid to make Leeds harder to beat in last Saturday’s - defeat at Leicester.But they were easy pickings for impressive Villa, who cruised to a - win against a side which have lost their way, bereft of self-belief and ill at ease with the system Marsch wants to implement. vw,vw,px, px\"Jesse Marsch’s first game in charge at Elland Road did not go to plan “It won’t be easy for me to sleep tonight,” Marsch admitted afterwards.“I’ll be watching thegame and my focus will be on understanding how to paint a pictureand Saturday, so that we can understand a little bit better what we need the game on Sunday to look like and how we need to handle being in the moment.”Leeds are two points above the relegation zone, but the two teams immediately below them, Everton and Burnley, have three and two games in hand respectively.Large sections of Leeds fans defiantly chanted Bielsa’s name after Villa defender Calum Chambers had sublimely curled home his side’s third goal.Other fans directed their resentment at the Argentinian’s controversial sacking squarely at the directors’ box.Next up is Norwich and the Leeds hierarchy will be bracing themselves as defeat to the top flight’s bottom club will turn the air at Elland Road toxic.Marsch added: “I understand their frustration and concern. But again, the most important thing is the belief and the courage that we have as a club, as a city and as a community.“I know with the fans you have to earn it. It’s not given, right  It’s the same with players, the same with directors, it’s the same with everything.🙌 Back in action! @Patrick_Bamford pic hEpkHkmXAz— Leeds UnitedMarch , “But I’m not afraid. I’m here for the right reasons and I want to help this club be the things I really believe it can be.”Patrick Bamford stepped off the bench against Villa to end his three-month injury lay-off and it remains to be seenthe striker will start on Sunday.Marsch fears Junior Firpo faces a long spell out after he left the field on a stretcher on Thursday night after injuring his knee in a challenge with Emiliano Buendia.Talisman Kalvin Phillips and skipper Liam Cooperwill not be ready until after the international break and Tyler Roberts has been ruled out for the rest of the season after hamstring surgery."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-262-todays-wordle-word-8-march-hints-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

People across the generations put their best foot forward at the city’s Titanic Quarter dressed in neon and glitter to raise money for le-changing dementia support and research.Mervyn Currie, an engineer in the food industry from Glarryford, who lost his mum to dementia cut the ribbon to start the walk.He volunteered to be a steward at the event after witnessing the effects of dementia first hand when he cared for his beloved mum Hannah Currie throughout her journey with the condition.Taking part in Friday’s event was emotional for Mervyn and his mum was never far from his thoughts.“It did bring it all back as you are surrounded by people who have all gone through the same thing but there was a great sense of comradeship too.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences, I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honor and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Hannah’s husband Robert passed away in  and she enjoyed  years of good health, but after a while Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. She was taken to hospital following a fall, where she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Meryn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and a carers who visited daily.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died infancy.“At the start caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one but you can’t really talk to them.”Hannah sadly passed away in , aged .“When she died it was still very dficult,” said Mervyn. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.”Those taking part in Friday’s event completed a .km route though Belfast, stepping out to stop dementia in its tracks after a devastating period for those living with the disease. People with dementia have been worst hit during Covid  and Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used more than six million times since the start of the pandemic.

This was largely due to the implementation of a number of emergency grant schemes, designed to provide support to businesses and iniduals subject to closure or restrictions.Mr Donnelly’s reports highlight four Covid schemes, totalling £ million, which, although recorded in Invest NI’s accounts, were actually controlled and administered by DfE. These include the Small Business Grant Scheme and the Tourism and Retail Sectors Grant.INI was instructed by the department to include the expenditure within its accounts as it had the correct legal powers to make the payments, whereas the department did not.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Donnelly concluded that INI had no role in the schemes’ design or delivery and that the schemes were actually administered by the department, meaning that the expenditure should have been recorded in the DfE’s accounts.It also means that the expenditure was incurred by DfE without the appropriate legal authority. As a result, he has qualied both sets of accounts on the basis that this expenditure was “irregular”.He also concluded that INI’s financial statements did not provide a true and fair view of the substance of the transactions and he has provided an adverse opinion on Invest NI’s accounts on that basis.Both the department and INI were provided with an opportunity to adjust their accounts to resolve the issues identied by the audit. They both declined to do so as they do not agree with the independent opinion of the CAG.This disagreement has, in part, contributed to the lateness of certication and publication of the annual report and accounts of both organisations.Mr Donnelly commented: “My report acknowledges the speed with which these support schemes were designed and delivered.“It is important to stress, though, that the issues I have identied do not merely pertain to technical matters, but to fundamental principles and standards of accounting with which all public bodies should comply.”The report also sets out the CAG’s qualication relating to Covid- business support schemes administered by Invest NI totalling £. million in -.Based on how these schemes were designed, INI relied on self-declarations by applicants as evidence that certain eligibility criteria had been met, with no corroborating evidence. As a result there was “insufficient audit evidence” to confirm that expenditure was regular.These schemes were launched at pace in response to the continued impact of the pandemic on Northern Ireland’s economy.Approval for their implementation was granted by Ministerial Direction, since the Department’s Accounting Officer was unable to provide evidence that these schemes would provide value for money or that there would not be an unacceptably high risk of error or loss of funds.In addition, Mr Donnelly’s report on INI notes “irregular income and expenditure” relating to a £. million loan made in previous years to Glenmore Generation Limited – an anaerobic digestion facility.The Department of Financeconsidered this loan to be irregular, because certain conditions of its approval had not been complied with and further approval had not been sought.Irregularities were also highlighted in relation to a £.m payment to Tourism Ireland Limited, where again DoF approval was not obtained.Commenting on these qualications to the accounts, Mr Donnelly said: “It is completely unacceptable that a Department fails to comply with the requirements of primary legislation it is relying on to make payments.“This is a basic requirement, and it is extremely disappointing to see that the Department has failed to learn lessons from its past failure on obtaining approvals required for the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme.”INI published its - Annual Report  Accounts on Wednesday. They say the accounts have been qualied by the NI Audit Office in two areas – expenditure relating to NI Executive Covid emergency response schemes and expenditure relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility.Responding to the qualications Mel Chittock, Interim CEO, Invest NI said: “We acknowledge the decision of the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualy our accounts.“The global pandemic was an unprecedented situation which required implementation and operation of emergency schemes outside of normal process.“I am confident that all the necessary steps were taken to provide the best solutions to get much needed emergency funding to businesses. We complied fully with the instructions given to us and NIAO found no irregularities.”Addressing the qualication relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility in more detail, she said under the Sustainable Utilisation of Poultry LitterScheme INI provided funding towards the build and operation of two anaerobic digestion plants.“The aim was to help resolve a signicant local environmental issue and to help Northern Ireland comply with EU nitrates targets, as well as provide economic benefits by supporting growth in the agri-food sector,” Ms Chittock said.“It was always understood that the development of anaerobic digestion plants using innovative technologies was high risk. This risk was balanced against the environmental and economic benefits to the NI economy.“The Glenmore facility encountered technical and operational dficulties and in  the owner operator decided to refinance the business. As a result, Invest NI, and the main funder, will not receive aon the initial investment made.“However, the plant remains operational, is contributing to the objectives of the SUPL Scheme, and producing green energy for two NI manufacturing businesses.”A review highlighted that there could have been improvements in Invest NI internal processes and that it could have taken more steps to better mitigate and manage the loan investment in this project.However, the Department of Finance concluded that some of the conditions it put in place around the loan were not met, and now views the loan as an irregular spend.INI insists that it has tightened its processes and procedures and formed a new Invest NI Governance Council focussed on implementing best practice and improvements right across the organisation.A DfE spokesperson said as the Covid crisis gripped the country, the department and its arm’sbodies responded immediately, with  schemes delivered at a cost of £m. which helped tens of thousands of local businesses.It is therefore disappointing, and not for the first time, that the Department is forced to clary its position following an NIAO report,” he added.“The Department’s accounts were presented to the NIAO in May , as agreed. A delay arose because of the NIAO’s interpretation of an accounting issue it had not raised the previous year when the same schemes were delivered.Despite obtaining extensive and robust legal advice supporting its approach, the Department was unable to persuade the NIAO of its position a position that was universally accepted and supported across Government.The Department’s Accounting Officer shared his legal opinion and wider supporting documentation with the NIAO in an attempt to agree a consensus. Unfortunately, a resolution to what was, and remains, a subjective issue in accounting terms, prevented the accounts from being laid on time as anticipated.”Most ReadNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Famous Belfast landmark ‘the balls on the Falls’ features on The ChaseHeating oil firms facing abuse and tears as prices soarCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedTop VideosPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlay moments captured by photographer Mark Condren at the Ukraine borderLatest Northern IrelandHistorical abuse victims told they were failed by state during public apologyMeeting of Stormont leaders fails to reach agreement on how to release £mApology to historical institutional abuse victims and survivors underway at StormontNorthern Ireland Met Office alert: Yellow warning issued for mph windsAnother  Covid-linked deaths recorded in weekly updateLatestJesse Marsch urges Leeds’ players to stick to the game-plan against NorwichBritain warns Putin over chemical weapons as Ukraine raises alarm on ChernobylCovid- infections rise in all UK nations with record levels in ScotlandChanting Cha fans urged to remember reasons for Roman Abramovich sanctionsWrong bin weight in Corrie McKeague search was due to error in process – inquest,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

True, our sportsmen, sportswomen and teams gave us much to cheer about and lted our hearts at times when there was little to celebrate. Sport did indeed keep going in the midst of adversity. But, looking back as an on-the-spot reporter, the notion of sport as an oasis of peace and harmony is just a tad revisionist.My job on the sports desk of the Belfastdid indeed seem normal compared to the work of my news-desk colleagues, who recorded more deadly scores as the body count mounted. But every now and then tensions on the streets spilled on to the terraces and sport migrated to the front pages for all the wrong reasons.My own personal baptism of fire arrived just two months into my Tele career, ignited by that bloody August Bank Holiday Monday of . Twenty-three people had died: four in the attack on Lord Mountbatten’s fishing boat off the Sligo coast eighteen soldiers in a double blast at Narrow Water, near Warrenpoint, all at the hands of the Provos and, largely forgotten, a curious English visitor, drawn to the water’s edge on the southern side of Carlingford Lough by the first blast at Narrow Water, who was shot dead by a panicking trooper who mistook him for one of the bombers. In the midst of the madness unleashed that sunny day, with community tensions stretched like piano wire and emotions off the scale, someone in the upper echelons of European football – and likewise the security services on both sides of the border – thought it a good idea to send Linfield to Dundalk, which is a few miles across the border in the Republic of Ireland, two days later for a European Cup tie. Talk about quenching flames with petrol.Context is everything for those born in the ensuing decades. Today, a Dundalk–Linfield game would not raise an eyebrow, let alone the state of high alert that accompanied the fixture in . Back then, Linfield was an exclusively Protestant team and club, drawing its support from staunch loyalist areas. The first Catholic players did not arrive until the s. Today, the team is fully inclusive. Dundalk at that time would have been a safe haven for on-the-run republicans and their sympathisers. A combustible mix at the worst of times. The events of that Bank Holiday Monday made the violence that would erupt inside and outside Oriel Park two nights later an absolute certainty – the blood was up – and still it was allowed to go ahead.Knowing what was going to happen, we journeyed like moths to a flame: our boss Malcolm Brodie in the driving seat of his Honda Accord automatic colleagues Bill Ireland, Gordon Hanna and me, his passengers. Three great newspaper men and sports writers, sadly no longer with us, and me, too young and foolish to be apprehensive and for whom the trip seemed like a great adventure. The reports they filed that night were never going to be about football. The normally bustling Dundalk we arrived in that afternoon was a ghost town, with the owners of pubs and shops hastily pulling down their shutters as word reached them of a pub wrecked by a busload of Linfield supporters in nearby Ravensdale. There wasn’t a Blueman in sight when we got there, but an advance party had clearly arrived as a Union Jack was fluttering from the Maid of Erin statue in Market Square. It was the calm before the storm.A blind man on a galloping horse could have seen the violence coming. Three thousand Linfield fans in a fleet of sixty buses descended on the border town where the local hoods were waiting, ready to defend their title. Gardaí, some not even in riot gear, were hopelessly unprepared, and outnumbered. Undisciplined stewards – bizarrely clad in white coats and resembling cricket umpiresDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up – attempted to drive back the rampaging Linfield hordes using wooden cudgels but were overrun. Worse still, the section housing the away fans was strewn with rubble that ought to have been cleared, completely negating the point of the police searches at the turnstiles. And a thin line of barbed wire was all that separated the goading Dundalk fans and police line from the snarling Linfield mob, who chewed it up and spat it out as they launched their attacks.An estimated  to  of the ,-plus Linfield supporters were involved in the violence, but, fuelled by drink and anger, they generated the sound and fury of ten times their number. However regular fans later asserted that many of these ‘supporters’ had never been to a Linfield match before.Unbelievably, at the outset, gardaí clodded stones back at them! The police baton-charged again and again but were driven back under the unreserved stand before calling in reinforcements. The trouble continued, despite appeals over the PA system by Dundalk and Linfield officials, and by Bluemen in the stands who were not involved in the violence and who tried to remonstrate with the mob. An uneasy peace settled, particularly after Warren Feeney scored the opening Linfield goal – though immediately after it, full back Terry Hayes was felled by a stone thrown from the Dundalk end. But more trouble was to develop. A tricolour was set alight at the Linfield end and, in response, the Dundalk crowd ripped up and burned a Union Jack.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn injured garda is led away from the pitch FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn injured garda is led away from the pitchComing up to half-time, the violence worsened, with more stone-throwing and more baton charges. However, at this stage, the gardaí appeared to be settling for a policy of trying to reason with the fans – at that stage they made no arrests and allowed the Linfield supporters not involved in the trouble to keep things under control.That plan soon broke down, however, and all hell was let loose during half-time, with vicious fighting, and Linfield fans up on the roof of the stand trying to remove the tricolour that was flying at full mast. Injured gardaí, many with blood streaming down their faces, were helped out of the ground and some stewards were also among the casualties. So, too, were a number of Linfield fans who had been arrested. We saw one dragged by police through the tearoom with blood gushing from a head wound.Dundalk officials continued to make appeals for order over the loudspeaker: ‘You are doing your club no good. Please stop firing missiles,’ they pleaded, to no avail. Later, when the teams took the field again, some of the Linfield players, led by their player-manager Roy Coyle, walked straight to the Linfield section involved in the violence and pleaded for order. Legendary captain Peter Rafferty and Feeney, scorer of Linfield’s goal, also appealed. Rafferty said afterwards, ‘There was one boy, and the smell of drink from his breath nearly made me drunk. Quite honestly, I’ve never seen any of those people at Windsor Park before.’They settled, but not for long. One fan climbed up on to the roof of the ground, and again tried to pull down the tricolour. He was tackled by a steward, who pelted the youth with stones and then retreated. And that was more or less the prelude for a big baton charge from gardaí. About three hundred of them rushed forwards, stepped over the barbed wire, which had been practically pulled asunder, and drove the Linfield fans back. More stones rained down on them, but they pushed on, driving the rioters back into the vast section of Linfield fans not involved, and who had earlier howled their disapproval of it all.At one stage, stewards rushed across the pitch while the game was continuing, but renowned referee Pat Partridge hardly noticed it. Meanwhile, behind the Linfield goal, the supporters were being driven back further and further into one corner.The casualty and arrest list by this time had increased signicantly. Order of Malta members had set up an impromptu First Aid room under the main stand before the ambulances arrived. Then the trouble spilled outside into Carrick Road. Three houses, a supermarket and a filling station were attacked and had windows smashed as the Linfield fans made their way back to the buses taking them home, parked up by the Harp brewery. The buses, too, were attacked, with more windows broken. Several had been smashed on the way to Dundalk as well, injuring some Linfield supporters.Meanwhile, in the Dundalk boardroom after the game, Linfield secretary Derek Brookes condemned the violence and, in particular, the troublemakers clad in blue. Their conduct, he said, had disgraced the club. ‘Unfortunately,’ said Mr Brookes, ‘they ignored our appeals for order, and Roy Coyle did his best as well. Fortunately, the hooligans were greatly outnumbered by genuine fans, and the game itself was played in a magnicent spirit. There was hardly a serious foul.’ Dundalk chairman Oliver Quinn said he was ‘sad and disappointed’. Referee Partridge said he wanted to make no comment, and neither would the UEFA observer at the match, Leo Callaghan from Wales. ‘It’s all here in my notes,’ he said. ‘But I don’t want to say anything. I’ll be making my report.’That report resulted in Linfield being held almost entirely accountable, being forced to pay Dundalk’s costs to travel to the Netherlands as well as an additional £, for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £ for providing insufficient security at the match. In an ironic postscript, Dundalk went on to defeat Maltese minnows Hibernians in the next round before drawing Celtic. The events of that night forty-two years ago in Dundalk showed Belfast would not have been ready for a match like that had it been Linfield who progressed.When order was finally restored as the Blue hordes left a shattered town, the ‘score’ was:  gardaí hurt  civilians injured, including  Linfield fans and a girl who remained in hospital the next day and  arrests made – mostly Linfield supporters, who appeared in court the next day and were fined.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and RTE journalist Charlie Bird with Ivan Little and Deric Henderson during the launch of Reporting the Troubles  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and RTE journalist Charlie Bird with Ivan Little and Deric Henderson during the launch of Reporting the Troubles And while the match itself yielded a £, ‘gate’, the Dundalk club revealed that the cost of staging the match, and paying for the damage would wipe out their profit. Linfield paid a high price, too, and not just reputational. UEFA chiefs quickly decided the club should carry the can for their supporters’ actions and ordered theleg to be played in Haarlem, Holland. Amid it all, a football match broke out, a credit to every player on the pitch and, fittingly, it ended in a – draw, Dundalk progressing with a – win, where Linfield’s goal scorer at Oriel Park, Warren Feeney, missed a penalty.That riot in  was by far the worst I have witnessed in a football ground in forty-two years chronicling the game here, and there have been many: the battle on the pitch at the end of the  Linfield–Glentoran Irish Cup final at Windsor the  final between the same clubs at which burning rafters rained down from inside the roof of the unreserved stand at The Oval Linfield–Donegal Celtic in  Cltonville–Celtic in the week of the internment anniversary in , when fans fought running battles with police who fired plastic bullets inside the ground, and when a service revolver was snatched and later used to murder an off-duty UDR soldier and the murder of reserve police officer David Purse, who was on duty at a Crusaders match at Seaview in . And so it went on through the s and s, the almost routine football disorder a microcosm of a violent and ided society.The fact that Dundalk has played without incident at Windsor in recent years shows how far most of us have come in the long, drawn-out decades of peace- and confidence-building since. And that has to be the biggest blessed relief of all.Jim Gracey was group sports editor of Belfast  Sunday Le, and spent over forty years reporting on local, national and international sport, including five football World Cups.

The festival was last held in .Cllr Hanna said that while it was disappointing that this yearrsquos event would not be going ahead, a number of suggestions for an alternative festival had been made. He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough. He steadied himself and began to address his companions.lsquoHe lted one hand and pointed ahead. He named the parts. He spoke of horses and ploughing points. He strained and balanced and explained.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

As with all aspects of museum work, this required both local and specialist knowledge, active travelling around the area and respectful relationships with the community.The museum developed a unique relationship with the community that was based on valuing and understanding the importance of lsquopeople and placersquo.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July. It will replace the townrsquos previous mart which closed two years ago.However, the mart is part of a much larger project which includes plans for animal processing facilities, a conference centre and extensive retailing outlets.Mr Hugh Linehan, chairman of the co-operative, says it will be the most advanced project of its kind in Northern Ireland and will bring jobs and wealth to the area.ldquoWe see this as the way ahead for local agriculture, Mr Linehan said yesterday.Funding for the mart phase is largely complete.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Most of the land is currently vacant.A pedestrian footbridge over the Cardf Bay Link road would connect to the proposed new arena development, which is likely to get planning permission on Wednesday, March .Cllr Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: “One of the ways in which we will ensure that a signicant amount of the pedestrians leaving the arena on an event day doesn’t go past residential properties iswe can get that additional station on Pierhead Street.“Because then people would be able to walk out of the arena, across the public square, and then over a new bridge which will take them to that station and then off to the east of Cardf.”He was addressing the council’s cabinet on Thursday, March , about the wider regeneration plans across Cardf Bay. These include turning Lloyd George Avenue into a linear park and upgrading the cycling lanes there, building a velodrome at the International Sports Village, building a new lido near Techniquest, and hosting events at Alexandra Head.As well as building a ,-capacity arena, the wider redevelopment of Atlantic Wharf would also see the Travelodge hotel and Red Dragon Centre relocated, new museums, a multi-storey car park, hotels, apartments, a new tourist attraction, and a public square. Most of this would be built where the Red Dragon Centre, County Hall and car parks currently are.But some concerns already raised by local residents include the noise of bands playing at the arena, and thousands of people leaving after a concert late at night. Having a new metro station at Pierhead Street could ert those people away from houses and flats nearby..removeTransport for Wales is due to start working on the railway along Lloyd George Avenue this August, electrying the track. The current route to Cardf Bay only stops at Queen Street station, and not Central station, but could soon be upgraded to stop there too. Another new station could also be built at Loudon Square.A recent cabinet report said: “The initial phase of the Cardf Bayproject is due to start on site in August , and the plans to link the new line into Cardf Central and onto a new station at Roath Basin are moving rapidly through the design phases.“The council is working with the Welsh Government to extend the current investment in the Core Valley Lines extension, to provide a direct link to Cardf Central station and to extend the line further into Cardf Bay, connecting to a proposed new transport hub at Pierhead Street, and onto a new station at Roath Basin.“This would essentially form the first phase of the council’s Crossrail project. Positive discussions have taken place and remain ongoing with the owner of the Pierhead Street site, which has been identied as the preferred location for the new Cardf Bay transport hub.“Later phases of the council’s Crossrail project will see new stations delivered at Splott, Tremorfa, Newport Road and then onto the proposed new Cardf Parkway mainline station, providing the first public transport rail infrastructure for the east of Cardf.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMarsch had  games to rescue Leeds’ season when the club made the bold decision to dispense with Marcelo Bielsa at the end of last month.The American has lost his first two games in charge and the manner of their club record-equalling sixth straight league defeat on Thursday against Aston Villa had some fans heading for the Elland Road exits long before the final whistle.🎙 𝗝𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗰𝗵: \"Were still digging hard. Im not afraid of it and I will do everything I can to help these guys\" pic HoZSCwYlM— Leeds UnitedMarch , Marsch said: “We just started trying a bunch of things that we never talked about and we have to stay to the plan. We have to stay to the plan.“If we don’t do that then we’re weaker. We see the weaknesses of our players and not the strengths. So that will certainly be a message.”There were signs that Marsch had made an immediate impact in his bid to make Leeds harder to beat in last Saturday’s - defeat at Leicester.But they were easy pickings for impressive Villa, who cruised to a - win against a side which have lost their way, bereft of self-belief and ill at ease with the system Marsch wants to implement. vw,vw,px, px\"Jesse Marsch’s first game in charge at Elland Road did not go to plan “It won’t be easy for me to sleep tonight,” Marsch admitted afterwards.“I’ll be watching thegame and my focus will be on understanding how to paint a pictureand Saturday, so that we can understand a little bit better what we need the game on Sunday to look like and how we need to handle being in the moment.”Leeds are two points above the relegation zone, but the two teams immediately below them, Everton and Burnley, have three and two games in hand respectively..removeLarge sections of Leeds fans defiantly chanted Bielsa’s name after Villa defender Calum Chambers had sublimely curled home his side’s third goal.Other fans directed their resentment at the Argentinian’s controversial sacking squarely at the directors’ box.Next up is Norwich and the Leeds hierarchy will be bracing themselves as defeat to the top flight’s bottom club will turn the air at Elland Road toxic.Marsch added: “I understand their frustration and concern. But again, the most important thing is the belief and the courage that we have as a club, as a city and as a community.“I know with the fans you have to earn it. It’s not given, right  It’s the same with players, the same with directors, it’s the same with everything.🙌 Back in action! @Patrick_Bamford pic hEpkHkmXAz— Leeds UnitedMarch , “But I’m not afraid. I’m here for the right reasons and I want to help this club be the things I really believe it can be.”Patrick Bamford stepped off the bench against Villa to end his three-month injury lay-off and it remains to be seenthe striker will start on Sunday.Marsch fears Junior Firpo faces a long spell out after he left the field on a stretcher on Thursday night after injuring his knee in a challenge with Emiliano Buendia.Talisman Kalvin Phillips and skipper Liam Cooperwill not be ready until after the international break and Tyler Roberts has been ruled out for the rest of the season after hamstring surgery..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Jesse Marsch urges Leeds u players to stick to the game-plan against Norwich article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Unfortunately we never know when someone near to us may need the services of AANI so let’s all try and raise some very valuable funds. “ On the day, Oonagh will also be joined by fellow AANI agribusiness group members, Martyn Blair and Barclay Bell. They are encouraging others from the agricultural sector to change the wellies for walking shoes on Sunday, May and join them for a walk, a chat and hopefully raise some funds for a great cause.
